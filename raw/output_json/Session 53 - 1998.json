        "file_text": "When I assumed the presidency of my country\nless than two months ago, I recalled that in the tradition of\nthe Aymara, an indigenous people of the Republic of\nBolivia, a human being and a country \u2014 and, may I say,\nthe United Nations \u2014 do their work if they manage to find\nharmony in seven fundamental fields.\nFor the Aymaras there is a type of harmony that rises\nfrom the head, and that is the harmony we need to maintain\nwith our beliefs and principles.\nThere is a second type of harmony which goes from\nthe feet down. That is the harmony we must maintain\nwith nature, the Earth and the environment.\nThere is a third harmony that goes from the body\nout to the right side. That is the harmony we must have\nwith our families, with those closest to us.\nA fourth type of harmony moves towards the left.\nThat is the harmony we must have with our neighbours,\nour colleagues at work and those others who, without\nbeing very close to us, surround us.\nThere is a fifth type of harmony which moves\nforward from us, and for the Aymara people that is\nharmony with the past. They believe that human beings\nface the past and not the future, because we can see what\nis in front of us, and the past is the only thing we can\nreally see.\nA sixth type of harmony is behind us. That is our\nharmony with the future, because although we do not see\nthe future we have an intuition about it and a sense of it.\nOften, although it has not yet come, we can already feel\nits weight on our shoulders.\nThe seventh and final type of harmony is self-\nharmony, an inner harmony.\nIf we achieve harmony in those seven areas, we will\nhave a harmonious body, a harmonious country and a\nharmonious world. It is with that vision that we have\n\n\nbegun to govern in Ecuador; and I believe it is with that\nvision that the United Nations is doing its work.\nWe can discuss many issues here. I want to focus on\ntwo, both related to left-sided harmony \u2014 harmony with\nour neighbours, international harmony \u2014 and their\nimplications for the development of our peoples.\nIn Latin America, as in many parts of the world, we\nface one of the gravest crises in our history. We have been\nconsidering the advantages of globalization. Now we are\nalso suffering the problems of globalization. When we\nspeak of a global system, we speak of a real network,\nwhich, like a large cobweb, encompasses us all. The\nproblem with such a network is that wherever we touch or\napply pressure to the web we produce a vibration and an\nimpact throughout the web.\nThe great majority of the countries of Latin America\nhave made enormous efforts to overcome the problems of\nprevious decades. They have worked to reduce their fiscal\ndeficits to a minimum, to open up to the global economy,\nto participate in trade and to share the principles of open,\nfair and transparent trade, free of discrimination. They have\nunderstood that integration is the tool for progress in the\nfuture. They have established regional markets, and now\nthey seek a continental market. After so much effort, which\nat times has been costly in internal terms, we have found\nthat that effort can be wasted, that it may not be a way out\nof our problems, because of an international crisis, which\ndid not originate in our countries; it came from outside, but\nbecause of globalization, and the network connecting us, we\nare all affected.\nWe understand the mechanics of the system. We\nunderstand how something that affects markets in Asia has\nan impact on Latin America. Yet, while we understand the\nmechanics of the system, we cannot see its fairness. If\nwhile working together we encounter problems that do not\noriginate in our region, we must ask the industrialized\ncountries in particular to take decisions that will ensure that\nnot all the countries of the world suffer to the extent that\nwe are suffering now.\nThere is talk of risk of a global recession as severe as,\nor even more severe, than that of the 1930s. We see the\nstock markets of the largest countries of our region affected\ndaily. We see a crisis that is already striking the\nindustrialized countries. I think this is the appropriate forum\nfor us to consider the need to work together. We small\ncountries like Ecuador can do little in a crisis of this\nmagnitude but call for reflection and true fraternity among\nour nations so that a problem affecting the whole world\ncan be overcome. Otherwise, a crisis as big as this leaves\nmany of us with no option but to wait and see how we\ncan protect ourselves against these troubles.\nThe countries of Latin America see ourselves as a\nregion, and we believe we must behave as a region. Every\ncountry has its own characteristics and has to do what is\nnecessary individually, but it is the region as a whole that\nis being affected by all these changes.\nThe countries of Latin America have not come here\nsimply to ask for money and loans, as they have done at\nother times of crisis. The countries of the region have not\nappeared here one by one to try to overcome their\ndifficulties on an individual basis, as on other occasions.\nThis time we have made joint proposals \u2014 just, global\nproposals. We hope these proposals will yield results.\nAll analysts maintain that unless interest rates are\nlowered, in particular in the industrialized countries, this\nglobal trend is undoubtedly not going to change. The 0.25\nper cent drop in interest rates was widely considered\nimportant but insufficient in view of the magnitude of the\ncurrent crisis. It is therefore crucial that we deal with this\nmatter here in the Assembly.\nAlong with this international crisis, Ecuador is\nconfronting an issue that is fundamental to its\ndevelopment: its relations with Peru, and the search for a\ndefinitive peace with Peru. We have a problem that has\nbeen dragged out over many decades. In its most recent\nstage, for the last 56 years, we have had a protocol of\npeace, friendship and boundaries, which should now enter\na definitive phase. Peace is our objective; we see it as an\nethical, moral and economic good. Nothing is more\nadvantageous to the budgets of our countries than peace.\nWe can do great things for the benefit of our economies.\nIn this case, peace is accompanied by a set of\nincentives, specifically, the possibility of $3 billion in\nloans from multilateral entities for border development\nprojects, irrigation, roads, agricultural systems, schools\nand health centres, to give a few examples. This $3\nbillion \u2014 a very large sum for both countries \u2014 can be\nput into action if we achieve peace.\nOver the past three years, we have been holding\ntalks. Commissions have reached agreements on border\nintegration, trade, navigation in the extraordinarily\nimportant basin of the Amazon river and measures of\nsecurity and confidence-building for the future. But the\n2\n\n\nmost delicate and difficult issue has yet to be resolved: the\nestablishment of the borderline between the two countries.\nWe have held talks at a number of levels \u2014 among our\nForeign Ministers, in the negotiating commissions, among\nthe countries that are guarantors of the protocol \u2014 and\nthese conversations have also risen to the level of the\npresidencies of Peru and Ecuador. We have had three\nmeetings in less than two months in order to seek that final\nagreement. Last night, I spoke with President Fujimori; he\nis planning to travel to the United States, and we agreed\nthat tomorrow we will see each other here in New York for\na fourth meeting to try to continue seeking the definitive\nformula that will resolve the question of our border in a\nway that is fitting, acceptable to the two countries and\nappropriate for our peoples.\nThe principles are clear. As countries, we cannot enter\nthe twenty-first century dragging with us problems that date\nback to the nineteenth. We must embark on the twenty-first\ncentury with a clear and positive vision that is directed\ntowards the future.\nWe share all the tenets of the United Nations on issues\nrelated to this one. We are completely in agreement with\nthe Ottawa Convention on the question of landmines. Our\ncountry signed that Convention, and at the end of last week\nin Brasilia, the Presidents of Peru and Ecuador submitted to\nPresident Cardoso of Brazil a joint communiqu\u00e9 requesting\nthat plans be drawn up for the removal of all the landmines\nthat have been placed in the border area over the years.\nThis is a positive and very real step; it means that the\nConvention will not simply be signed and ratified but will\nalso be applied in practical terms in the field.\nWe are also completely in agreement with the\nproposals of the United Nations on the reduction of military\nbudgets and expenditures. We believe that money should be\ninvested in poverty reduction and in the social programmes\nand projects our peoples need so much. We are completely\nin agreement with the conventional disarmament\nprogrammes. We believe that trust must replace distrust,\nand we believe that this task, accomplished jointly, can\nallow us to leave behind long decades of mutual suspicion\nand the great scepticism that sometimes pervades our\ncountries. We are in agreement as regards general and\ncomplete disarmament. We agree with the prohibition of\nnuclear weapons. We welcome the decision of the Southern\nCone Common Market (MERCOSUR) to make all the\ncountries of that region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nWe believe in peace, and we are working to achieve\nit. It will be hard to find, in the future, two Presidents of\nneighbouring countries with a history of problems who\nare so firmly committed to peace, so deeply convinced\nthat they must achieve peace, and so zealously at work to\nreach a speedy, just and honourable peace. We hope our\nefforts will soon meet their reward.\nWe completely support the initiatives of the United\nNations on the subject of the protection of human rights.\nEcuador has adopted its own national human rights plan\ninto law. We are the second country in Latin America,\nand one of the first in the world, to adopt such a plan. It\nis not a plan of the Ecuadorian Government, but a plan\nmade by Ecuadorian society, coordinated by the Ministry\nwith the participation of representatives of various sectors\nof the society. We believe in human rights, and we\ndefend them in their entirety and without reservation. Our\nMinister for Foreign Affairs was the first United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights before joining our\nMinistry for Foreign Relations, so our support in this field\nis complete.\nIn addition, we are concerned about the issue of\nsustainable development, and we will vigorously promote\nenvironmental issues. For the first time in history, a\nwoman from a country that is not in the northern\nhemisphere has become chairperson of the world\u2019s largest\nintergovernmental organization on the environment. That\nwoman\u2019s name is Yolanda Kakabadse, and she is the\npresent Minister of the Environment in Ecuador. We seek\nto indicate several things by this, which are easily\nunderstandable in what I have just said.\nThese are the central issues in the link between the\nUnited Nations and my country: peace, the international\ncrisis and the search for a just global accord, the\nenvironment and human rights. Other issues could be\ntaken up, but I prefer to focus on this message.\nI believe that there is no better way to pay tribute to\nthe United Nations and to commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nthan for two countries with democratically elected\nGovernments to seek peace and endeavour to sign a peace\nagreement \u2014 perhaps sign one this year \u2014 so that the\ndevelopment of our peoples can proceed and their quality\nof life can improve.\nIn this way we can sum up the most important\nhuman rights. Democracy, freedom, development, life, the\nright to work, gender-related issues, the problems of\nminorities and the most disadvantaged groups and the\nprotection of children are encompassed in these words\nthat are so simple and so important: peace, development\nand international cooperation. We want to emphasize these\nideas here, in this Organization which has done so much to\nbring them about throughout the world.\nI wish the Assembly every success in its work for the\nbenefit of all of humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Costa Rica is extremely pleased at Mr. Didier Opertti\u00e2s\nelection to preside over the work of this fifty-third session\nof the General Assembly. We say this not just as the\nritual greeting required by protocol, but as an expression\nof our deeply felt congratulations to a gifted citizen of the\nAmericas and as an expression of our certainty that in this\nposition the noble qualities you have displayed as a great\njurist in the inter-American system and as the\ndistinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister\nRepublic of Uruguay will once again be shown.\nIn presenting our respectful greetings to the\nSecretary-General, my delegation also wishes to express\nits sincere recognition of the enormously courageous\nefforts he has made in the Secretariat in favour of\nmaintaining international peace and security, as well as\nhis efforts to renew and modernize the United Nations.\nCosta Rica congratulates you, Sir, for your work and\nencourages you to continue in your endeavours, which do\nhonour to Ghana and to Africa.\nWe are approaching the twenty-first century, the\nthird millennium of our era, at a dizzying speed. In a few\nyears, all of us here will be men and women of the past\ncentury. Nevertheless, we have the obligation to bestow\nupon the new millennium a world of greater solidarity.\nThis subject calls for reflection. What have we done so\nfar, and most of all, what are we doing about the\nimminent future? What positive contributions can we\nmake to the new horizon that is opening up in the annals\nof history?\nUndoubtedly, the very existence of the United\nNations constitutes a most positive element. In 1945, this\nOrganization emerged as a successor, on a larger scale, to\nthe ideal of peace embodied in the League of Nations.\nThe 51 countries represented in San Francisco aspired to\nbuild a world in which harmony would prevail and where\ninternational security would be supported by a far more\nsolid foundation. Today, in this Hall, almost all the\ncountries of the world are represented \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we hope that in\nthe near future there will be no exceptions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and each of\nthem has taken upon itself the obligation to abide by the\npurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter.\nUnder the vigorous leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt,\nthe members of the Commission on Human Rights of the\nEconomic and Social Council worked untiringly, freely\nand openly discussing the subject, and trying to\nharmonize approaches that encompassed both Western\nhumanism and the ancient philosophy of the East. The\nfruit of their efforts was the adoption, on 10 December\n1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n26\n\n\nDuring those bitter years, when the shadows left by\nthe worldwide conflagration had not yet cleared, and those\nof the bipolar confrontation were already looming, some\nbelieved that the Declaration was a pleasant, romantic and\nentirely unrealistic suggestion.\nOthers saw it, on the contrary, as our species\u00e2 best\nhope, in the conviction that international relations have\nethical value only insofar as they guarantee the dignity of\nhuman beings, which is our very essence as rational\ncreatures, through respect for our natural attributes. As the\nformer President of Chile, Mr. Eduardo Frei Montalva once\nstated, the ratification of the Declaration was a\ndemonstration of faith in peace, faith in the peoples of the\nworld and faith in moral progress.\nI am proud to be able to say that Costa Rica\nenthusiastically supported the Declaration; since then, Costa\nRica has expressed its firm belief that human rights cannot\nbe subordinated to the interests of States. Today our\ncountry is the seat of the Inter-American Court of Human\nRights, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, and\nthe University for Peace of the United Nations. Throughout\nCosta Rica\u00e2s history as a Member of the United Nations, it\nhas consistently been committed to the cause of human\nrights, in both the international arena and the domestic\nsphere.\nOn this occasion, I reiterate to the Assembly all Costa\nRica\u00e2s firm, solemn and unconditional commitment to\ncontinue fighting actively, whenever and wherever, to\nachieve full respect for all human rights.\nToday my country reaffirms that its voice will\ncontinue to be heard in all forums on behalf of the noble\nethical and moral ideals that we proclaimed 50 years ago.\nPerhaps the most important legacy that the United\nNations of the twentieth century will leave to the United\nNations of the twenty-first century will be the certitude that\nhuman rights are a matter of universal concern. This\nconviction has allowed the broad conceptual, legal and\npolitical development of the subject of human rights. We\nhave debated and signed pacts, conventions and protocols\non increasingly specific aspects of human rights.\nDespite this prodigious pile of legal instruments,\nhumanity is still very far from having inscribed human\nrights on its very spirit. In many aspects, the commitment\nto an ethic of coexistence is as absent from the events of\ntoday as it was half a century ago.\nCosta Rica observes with regret the instances of\nintolerance and violence that still persist in our world, the\nethnic, religious, cultural, national, ideological or gender\ndiscrimination: the conflicts in the Balkans, the tragic\nwars endured by some African peoples, the situation in\nAfghanistan and the savagery of terrorism in various parts\nof the world. We are extremely concerned by the limited\nprogress of the Middle East peace process and the\nincreasing virulence of national extremism and religious\nfanaticism in certain countries.\nMy country believes that these serious problems\nmust be faced from an ethical standpoint, with the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights as the basic code\nfor the conduct of both States and individuals.\nThe legal validity of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights is no longer debated today. However, for\na long time, doubts and objections were raised as to the\npossibility of establishing mechanisms to guarantee it.\nThanks to the efforts of many years, the United\nNations now has a High Commissioner for Human\nRights. My country is proud to have been one of the main\nsponsors of the establishment of that office.\nOne of the most important events that has taken\nplace this year was the successful culmination of the\neffort to establish an International Criminal Court.\nThe valuable experience of the International\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of which\nthe Second Vice-President of Costa Rica, Judge Elizabeth\nOdio, is a member \u00e2\u20ac\u201d undoubtedly contributed to\nstrengthening the conviction on the need for a permanent\ncourt to try the most serious violations of human rights.\nMy country embraces the adoption of the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court, which took place in\nRome on 17 July of this year, whereby the international\ncommunity rejects and condemns the most heinous crimes\nagainst our universal conscience. We are especially\npleased that the Rome Conference included within its\ndefinition of crimes violations of the basic norms of\ninternational humanitarian law, applicable both to\ninternational and internal conflicts. In addition, in the\nlight of the tragic experiences of some Latin American\ncountries in the recent past, we are gratified by the\ninclusion of the legal definition of forced disappearance.\nI am pleased to announce that, in the coming days,\nI will have the honour of signing the Court\u00e2s Statute on\n27\n\n\nbehalf of my country, and I express Costa Rica\u00e2s firm\nintention to proceed with its speedy approval and\nratification.\nMy country is convinced of the necessity to establish\na commission that will prepare, before the year 2000, the\nessential conditions for the Statute to enter into force. Costa\nRica believes that the commission should be convened as\nsoon as possible.\nThis year, in addition to celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nmy country will celebrate another anniversary which, for\nCosta Ricans, is no less important: the fiftieth anniversary\nof the abolition of the Costa Rican army, decreed on 1\nDecember 1948. Only 10 days later, Costa Rica adopted the\nMagna Carta of international ethics, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\nThe abolition of the army was the culmination of my\ncountry\u00e2s long anti-militaristic history. In 1866, the then\nPresident of Costa Rica, Mr. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Mar'a Castro, stated that\none of the foundations of external peace is a strict\nadherence to international law, among whose prescriptions,\nas listed by President Castro, are dignity, good faith, loyalty\nand frankness. Today, as then, my country believes that in\norder to invoke international law and aspire to be a\nrespected and valued State without need of military support,\nCosta Rica\u00e2s principal duty is to govern its domestic and\ninternational conduct by a system of values that is grounded\nin the fundamental rights of individuals.\nAs a result of its historical and moral tradition, Costa\nRica believes that there are no small countries when it\ncomes to consolidating and preserving peace. Such has been\nCosta Rica\u00e2s rule of conduct when it has had the\nopportunity, as it does now, to be a member of the Security\nCouncil.\nFor this same reason, Costa Rica has tenaciously\nsupported the work aimed at general disarmament, and in\nparticular the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction,\nand has vigorously condemned the carrying out of nuclear\ntests. In that regard, my country urges all those States that\nhave not yet done so to adhere fully and unconditionally to\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nBecause of the values that have emerged from its own\nexperience, Costa Rica has invariably repudiated terrorism\nin all its manifestations, wherever and by whomever it is\ncommitted. We do not believe that there is any justification\nfor attacks against innocent people. Likewise, we condemn\nthose Governments that support, shelter and give\nassistance to those who commit or instigate terrorist acts,\nin clear violation of their international obligations.\nWe believe that the international community must\nmake special efforts to prevent and eliminate international\nterrorism. In this context, we stress the recent negotiations\non an International Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings, and we urge Member States to sign\nit. We also trust that during this session of the General\nAssembly decisive progress can be made on the\npreparation of an international convention for the\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. My delegation\nwishes to express how deeply pleased it is that the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction is to enter into force within six months.\nMy country urges all those States that have not yet done\nso to accede to that Convention as soon as possible.\nWe are pleased to see that in Central America \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nnotwithstanding the conflicts and the turmoil that our\ncountries faced during the last decade \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there are signs\nof progress towards the elimination or substantial\nreduction of military expenditures. Some countries have\neliminated their armed forces, and others have reduced\nthem significantly. Costa Rica does not intend to either\nexport or impose any models on others, but it warmly\napplauds the decision of these brother countries.\nThe international community should acknowledge the\nspecific progress that has been made in reducing military\nexpenses by developing countries. In this spirit, Costa\nRica wishes to propose the creation of a special fund for\nCentral America, which would be established through\ncontributions of developed countries and organizations.\nThe idea would be that each dollar not spent on military\nbudgets would be at least matched by contributions for\nsocial development programmes to strengthen democratic\nsystems in our region.\nThe Central American peace process has been one of\nthe most successful ones of recent times. Only a decade\nago, in this same Hall, we were exhausting ourselves\ndiscussing and commenting on the effects of the Central\nAmerican crisis. Today, our countries rarely make the\nheadlines of the international press. However, we would\nlike to stress that, notwithstanding Central America\u00e2s huge\nsocial and economical problems, it resolutely continues to\nwork to consolidate for its children a more dignified and\nfreer way of life, more in accordance with the spirit of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have\n28\n\n\nprogressed in the areas of electoral democracy and freedom\nof expression. Now the time has come to consolidate\nparticipatory democracy. Therefore, at the end of this\ncentury and of the millennium, Costa Rica has begun a\nprocess of national political dialogue, with broad popular\nparticipation, in order to strengthen our more than 100-year-\nold democracy.\nThe Central American countries have worked\nstrenuously for the integration and liberalization of our\neconomies. We have achieved important progress in our\nintegration mechanisms and structural adjustment processes.\nWe are participating actively in the negotiations aimed at\ncreating a free-trade area throughout the Americas, and we\ncontinue to maintain a policy of openness and commercial\nlinks among the Latin American countries.\nDespite the regional efforts to redraft its economic\nplans and to adapt them to the world market\u00e2s requirements,\nCosta Rica views with apprehension the creation of\neconomic unions or commercial blocks that beget new\ndiscrimination against third countries. Similarly, new\nconditionalities in the commercial policy of the\nindustrialized economies and the use of managed-trade\nmechanisms are a clear impediment to the ideal of free\ntrade and create new inequalities of access to the world\neconomy.\nAt the same time, we observe that, while the global\ntrade in raw materials and agricultural products is losing its\nvigour, the exchange of high-technology goods is growing\nstronger. This means that the portion of trade traditionally\ncarried out by the developing countries is becoming weaker\nin the global context. In this regard, Costa Rica urges the\nopening of markets, not only of the small economies, but\nalso of the large and industrialized economies. Costa Rica\nalso advocates commitment to the ideal of free trade that\ngave birth to the World Trade Organization and respect for\nits rules and resolutions in order to create an international\nenvironment more propitious for developing countries\u00e2\neconomic progress.\nFree trade encourages economic growth, and economic\nfreedom encourages the creation of wealth within the\nnations. In accordance with these principles, my country\nundertook, in 1997, the chairmanship of the negotiating\nprocess for the free-trade zone of the Americas, and we are\ntrying to contribute dynamically to its progress.\nWe are also making efforts to attain fair and non-\ndiscriminatory access for Central American products to\nmarkets in the United States and the European Union \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nthe region\u00e2s principal trade partners. In both markets, our\ncountries have been negatively affected by the diversion\nof trade and investment that have resulted from the\ngranting of preferential concessions to third countries,\nwhich are displacing our main exports. We refute the neo-\nprotectionist arguments of the groups who are trying to\nobstruct the access of Central American products to those\nmarkets. For this reason, we are promoting the\nstrengthening of the Caribbean Basin Initiative in order to\ncorrect those diversions and inequities. Furthermore, we\nbelieve there should be better opportunities for our\nexports to the European Union through its generalized\npreferences system. We are also promoting tariff\nreduction for agricultural products in all the industrialized\ncountries.\nAt the same time, Costa Rica urges industrialized\nnations to cooperate with the efforts to strengthen the\ninternational financial institutions in order to ensure the\nstability of the world financial system. Institutions such as\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and\nregional entities such as the Inter-American Development\nBank must provide support to overcome the crises that\ncause financial instability, especially in the emerging\nmarkets.\nWhile some believe that economic profit and ethics\nhave nothing to do with each other, experience has shown\nus otherwise. Capitalism without rule of law and not\nsubject to ethical rules usually causes scourges such as\nthe spread of drug-trafficking, the reign of organized\ncrime and corruption.\nMy country, like many others, has been affected by\nthese phenomena. Mr. Miguel Angel Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez\nEcheverr'a, President of Costa Rica, is actively\nparticipating in both the fight against and the prevention\nof these scourges, and he gave proof of his commitment\nto this cause when he contributed to the success of the\nrecent special session of the General Assembly on drug-\ntrafficking. For Costa Rica, these struggles can be won\nonly if they have a solid ethical foundation. Genuine\nethical leadership can do more for the long-lasting and\nsustainable prosperity of a society than the best laws and\nthe most detailed treaties.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not\nonly a statement of rights, it is also a clear statement of\nevery human being\u00e2s duties to the community. One of the\nfundamental obligations of all persons is to behave\nfraternally with their fellow men and the environment.\n29\n\n\nCosta Rica has not been exempt from the problems\ncaused by environmental degradation. However, my\ncountry\u00e2s authorities and many organizations of our civil\nsociety are working strenuously to solve them. In a\nrelatively short time, we Costa Ricans have achieved major\nprogress in the task of recovering and preserving our rich\nbiodiversity, while at the same time transforming it into a\nsource of income. For example, Costa Rica is today one of\nthe developing countries that has undertaken a leading role\nin carbon-fixation projects. We have negotiated important\nbilateral agreements based on the filtration capability of our\nforests. Those agreements have allowed us to become the\nfirst country to issue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sale of oxygen\u00e2\u20ac\u009d certificates as\nspecific proof of the quantity of captured emissions.\nMy country has been the recipient of important\ninternational cooperation programmes. In many areas we\ncontinue needing them. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that\ncooperation is a two-way street in which we can all teach\nand learn, give and receive. Costa Rica believes that its\nexperience in ecological matters may be useful to many\nother countries and it makes it available to the international\ncommunity.\nFurthermore, my country would like to express its firm\nintention to offer technical cooperation for development, in\nthe modest measure of its capabilities, through the action of\na specialized office that is being established for such a\npurpose. Thanks to this office, Costa Ricans will share with\nother nations our experiences in the areas of health,\neducation, ecology, human rights and electoral\ndevelopment.\nFor Costa Rica, the respect for diversity consecrated\nin the Universal Declaration must be an essential\ncharacteristic of the Member States of the United Nations.\nIn this regard, we are always conscious of the valuable\nlesson of the African thinker, Salif Tall Tierno-Bokar, when\nhe taught that the rainbow owes its beauty to the varied\ntones of its colours in the same way that the voices of\nvarious believers make up a harmony that rises up to\ndivinity.\nThe survival of the human species cannot be based on\na system of separate existences. Since human beings first\nappeared on the face of the earth, they must have had an\nawareness of their individual limitations and must have\nunderstood that they could not survive without the other\nmembers of their species. Today, such natural wisdom of\nour far-distant ancestors continues to be valid. We must live\nin community in order to build the future.\nThe concept of love for our fellow men is at the\ncore of all religions. The ancient texts of the great\nmasters of China, Mexico and India, and the Torah, the\nGospel and the Koran, regardless of any differences, are\nall permeated with a deep sense of identity among\nindividuals.\nMoral and spiritual perfection, the dream of so many\nthinkers and the innermost aspiration of so many peoples,\ncannot be reached without a basis in the constructive and\nfraternal coexistence of all the nations.\nAt this moment in history, we the people who\ninhabit the earth must create a civilization of peace and\nsolidarity. The twenty-first century should be the century\nof the culture of peace, which is also the culture of\nfreedom, tolerance and solidarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In his election I see the\nrecognition of the role played internationally by the\nRepublic of Uruguay, an Ibero-American country and a\nfriend of Portugal, as well as our appreciation and our\nconfidence that his personal, intellectual and professional\nqualities will result in success in our work.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, for the dedicated and\ncompetent manner in which he steered the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session.\nTo the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, I renew my\ntribute for the remarkable manner in which he has been\ncarrying out his difficult functions during a period in\nwhich the United Nations is increasingly called upon to\nintervene in many aspects of international life.\nI would like to dwell upon some questions of\nparticular importance to my country, beginning with those\nof a political nature, including Africa. I recall that my\nAustrian colleague has already addressed the Assembly on\nbehalf of the 15 States members of the European Union.\nWhen releasing last April his excellent report on the\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of lasting peace and\nsustainable development in Africa, the Secretary-General\ndid not hesitate to qualify as \u201ccolossal\u201d (S/1998/318,\npara. 5) the scale of the human tragedy that persists in\nparts of the African continent, which has been devastated\nby the conflicts that have affected a number of States\nsince the end of the cold war.\nWithin its possibilities and in accordance with the\nhistorical, cultural and social ties that bind it to many\nregions and countries of Africa, Portugal continues to\nmake efforts towards helping overcome those conflicts by\npeaceful means and towards the promotion of economic\ndevelopment, social progress and good governance, which\nare indispensable for their eradication. I would like to\nunderline the readiness Portugal has shown to participate\nin United Nations peacekeeping missions, particularly in\nAfrica. By way of example, I recall the role played by\nPortuguese forces within the framework of the peace\n15\n\n\nprocess in Mozambique, and in the ongoing United Nations\nmissions in Angola, in Western Sahara and, most recently,\nin the Central African Republic, as well as in the\nevacuation operations undertaken in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and in Guinea-Bissau.\nI must express here the very serious concern of my\ncountry at the situation in Angola, a country to which we\nare bound by so many and such deep ties. The signs of\nrupture are becoming more dangerously evident in the\npeace process, which has proceeded with such difficulty.\nThe refusal by the Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia\nTotal de Angola (UNITA) to comply fully with the\nobligations of the Lusaka Protocol, which it freely signed,\nwith regard to its demilitarization and transformation into\na political party, and its obstruction of the normalization of\nState administration contribute to the resort to military\noptions outside the framework of the negotiated solutions\nadopted by the international community.\nAs a member of the troika of observer countries to the\nAngolan peace process and as one of countries that\ncontributed most to the United Nations Angola Verification\nMission (UNAVEM) and to the United Nations Observer\nMission in Angola (MONUA), Portugal remains committed\nto promoting concord in Angola in close cooperation with\nthe United Nations and, in particular, with the new Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Issa Diallo,\nwhose difficult mission should be helped and supported.\nWe are, however, fully aware of the fact that all the\ndiplomatic efforts will be in vain if those responsible in\nAngola do not have an effective will for peace. The\nGovernment and UNITA must assume their responsibilities\nto the Angolan people, whose right to peace, security and\nwell-being is legitimate and inalienable. We appeal, once\nagain, for the Lusaka Protocol to be respected, and in\nparticular appeal to UNITA to assure immediately the\nProtocol?s implementation, in strict accordance with the\nterms that have been demanded of it by the Security\nCouncil.\nThe gains of a multi-party system in Angola must not\nbe jeopardized. Its participants, particularly having endorsed\npeace and national reconciliation, must not see the erection\nof barriers to the respective mandates, and all must be\ngiven the conditions of security necessary to face the\nreconstruction of the country.\nThe Secretary-General deserves our full support in\ncontinuing to promote all the necessary responses that the\ngravity of the situation requires from the international\ncommunity.\nGuinea-Bissau \u2014 a friend of Portugal with which\nwe also share many varied and strong affinities \u2014 has\nsince June been the site of a conflict that has had grave\nhuman, economic and social consequences for its people.\nAt the express request of the parties to the conflict,\nPortugal and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\nCountries (CPLP) \u2014 which is principally made up of\nAfrican countries, and has among its main goals the\npolitical and diplomatic coordination of its members?\npolicies \u2014 carried out from the start mediation efforts\ndesigned to stop the fighting, obtain a negotiated solution\nto the conflict and bring humanitarian assistance to the\npopulation of Guinea-Bissau. At no time was it possible\nto doubt the legitimate intentions that led the CPLP, of\nwhich Guinea-Bissau is a founding member, to respond\nto the request made to it. The CPLP?s intervention\naligned itself with that of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS), eventually permitting\nthe signature of a ceasefire agreement between the\nGovernment and the military junta, which opened the way\nto a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\nStill on the African continent, a word is also due on\nthe events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We\ndefend unequivocally the need to respect the territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty of that vast country, whose\nstability is strategically essential to the region in which it\nis located. We support unconditionally the African peace\ninitiatives that seek a negotiated and peaceful solution to\nthe complex political problems of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, which are at the heart of the\nconflict and cannot and should not have a solution based\non the use of force or on the presence of foreign military\nforces.\nNotwithstanding continued difficulties, we still\nbelieve in a democratic, free and prosperous future for\nAfrica. We are therefore committed to bringing to fruition\nthe initiative we launched in 1996 to hold a summit\nbetween the European Union and Africa, which is now\nscheduled for 2000. We therefore welcomed with\nsatisfaction the decision taken by the most recent\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) summit in\nOuagadougou to endorse that initiative.\nI would now like to refer to another source of\nserious and justified concern for the international\ncommunity, this time on the European continent: the crisis\nin Kosovo, which jeopardizes peace and stability in the\n16\n\n\nBalkans and is producing heavy human losses, in terms of\ndeaths, injuries, internally displaced persons and refugees.\nThere can be no doubt as to who bears the primary\nresponsibility for the eruption of the current crisis. The\nadoption a few minutes ago by the Security Council of a\nresolution co-sponsored by Portugal is a clear signal of the\ndetermination of the international community and cannot be\nignored by those to whom it is addressed.\nPortugal welcomes the constructive spirit that\ndominated the most recent round of ministerial talks on the\nquestion of East Timor, held under the auspices of the\nSecretary-General, whose efforts at mediation, as well as\nthose of his Special Representative, Ambassador Marker\nand his collaborators, I would especially like to\ncongratulate. I believe I can, for the first time, say that\neffective and promising steps have been taken towards\ncreating the conditions to achieve a just, comprehensive and\ninternationally acceptable solution to this problem, with full\nrespect for the legitimate rights of the East Timorese\npeople, in accordance with the principles of the Charter and\nthe relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\nWhile safeguarding the basic positions of principle of\nthe parties, it was agreed to negotiate for East Timor a\nwide-ranging autonomy that we wish to see rest on\ngenuinely democratic and participatory rules for its people,\nwho, it is hoped, will progressively establish an ample\ndegree of self-government. It was also agreed to associate\nmore closely the East Timorese \u2014 whose will, freely\nexpressed in accordance with their legitimate right to self-\ndetermination, will be essential to validate any definitive\nsolution to the question \u2014 with the process of negotiations\nunder way, entrusting the Secretary-General with the\nresponsibility of promoting that wide consultation.\nIt is necessary now to achieve tangible progress with\nregard to the more critical aspects of the situation in the\nterritory, such as the reduction of the Indonesian military\npresence, the release of all East Timorese political\nprisoners, including Xanana Gusmao, and the monitoring by\nthe United Nations of the evolution of the situation on the\nground.\nWe believe that we are still at a turning point. Nothing\nsubstantial has yet been settled or guaranteed. That is why\nwe consider it essential that the international community\ncontinue to follow closely the evolution of this process in\nits varied aspects, so that the goal of finally enabling the\npeople of East Timor to enjoy a future of freedom, peace\nand security is not delayed any further.\nIn just over a year, on 20 December 1999, the\nterritory of Macao, currently under Portuguese\nadministration, will return to the sovereignty of the\nPeople?s Republic of China, in fulfilment of the terms of\nthe Luso-Chinese Joint Declaration of 13 April 1987. The\ntransition process has been carried out in a constructive\nand pragmatic climate, reflecting the good relations that\nexist between the two countries. We are convinced that\nthis climate will persist until the end, thus guaranteeing a\ntransfer of power conducive to the future stability and\nprosperity of Macao, while respecting its autonomy and\nuniqueness.\nAs a short note on the question of official\ndevelopment assistance, I would like to put on record\nthat, according to data on 1997 recently issued by the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD), Portugal was the donor that registered the\nlargest increase in this type of aid \u2014 27.3 per cent.\nWithin the framework of the International Year of\nthe Oceans, Portugal dedicated the last World Exposition\nof this century \u2014 EXPO ?98 \u2014 to the theme \u201cThe\noceans: a heritage for the future\u201d, attempting in this\nmanner to contribute to a progressive enlightenment of\nhumanity with regard to the risks and challenges related\nto the preservation of the oceans.\nStill in this area, Portugal has participated actively\nin various activities undertaken in the context of the\nUnited Nations, namely at the level of the\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the Independent World\nCommission on the Oceans. In fact, Portugal was granted\nthe honour of the presidency of the latter, in the person of\nDr. Mario Soares, and its work led to the adoption of the\nreport approved in Lisbon at the beginning of this month,\nwhich appeals for a democratic, equitable and peaceful\nmanagement of the \u201cocean ... our future\u201d, and which will\nbe submitted to the General Assembly.\nPortugal is a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil until the end of this year. We have sought to\ncontribute effectively to the strengthening of the Council?s\nauthority and the effectiveness of its action, in accordance\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter. On the\nother hand, increasing the transparency and democratic\nnature of its functioning is essential to us, allowing, in\nthis way, non-members to better follow the work of the\nCouncil.\n17\n\n\nThis year, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, none can\npurport to defend international law and legitimacy while\nignoring the fulfilment of those fundamental rights.\nTerrorism is one of the most perverse forms of human\nrights violation, and a coordinated international effort to\ncombat it is urgently required.\nI should like to mention that Portugal is a candidate\nfor membership in the Commission on Human Rights, for\na mandate that will begin in January 2000 and that will\ncoincide with the Portuguese Presidency of the European\nUnion.\nIn an era of globalization \u2014 of markets, information,\ncirculation of people and cultural exchange \u2014 we also have\na duty to include in the international agenda the\nglobalization of human rights. This will be the best tribute\nwe can pay to the Universal Declaration that was issued 50\nyears ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is not without some emotion that I appear before this\nAssembly both as Head of State of Burkina Faso and\ncurrent Chairman of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), to extol, here in this sanctuary of nations, peace\nand harmony between human beings.\nTo promote peace and security for our era and for\nfuture generations is the objective of the nations of the\nworld gathered here. It is also the message which I bring\non behalf of Africa, being convinced that, armed with this\nimmense hope, the Organization for African Unity and\nthe United Nations, intimately linked, can make a reality\nof humanity\u2019s legitimate aspiration to a better destiny.\nBut first, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, as\nwell as the other members of the Bureau, upon your\nelection and the confidence placed in you to bring the\nwork of this fifty-third session to a successful conclusion.\nI also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, on\nthe energy with which he discharged his duties.\nMr. Secretary-General, I would like to address my\ncongratulations to you and your staff on the work you\nhave done in so little time and offer my encouragement\n16\n\n\nfor the battles still to be won. It is entirely to the credit of\nthe whole United Nations system that it carries the torch of\npeace higher every day.\nThe century which is drawing to its close will be\nremembered as one of great challenges. Seriously shaken by\nthe two world conflicts, it also mustered the necessary\nresources to sound the death knell of colonialism and\napartheid.\nThe liberation of colonized peoples and territories was\nhistorically necessary to ensure greater justice, tranquillity\nand well-being for our civilization, a civilization which\nfinally understood that its survival lay in the organization\nof a genuine collective security. But the cold war, which\nled to bipolar confrontation exacerbated by ideological\nantagonism, made this security illusory. International peace\nand security have not been consolidated with the end of the\ncold war. Conflicts and disturbances which no authority\ncould contain quickly followed. The resurgence of these\ncrises and the inadequacy of the solutions proposed to\nresolve them bring to mind the plight of the Dana\u00efdes,\nthose mythological beings who were condemned to fill up\na bottomless barrel.\nThe international community\u2019s failure to restore peace\nto Somalia and to prevent genocide in Rwanda will stand\nout in the history of the African continent. This failure has\nundoubtedly greatly contributed to awakening our somewhat\nlethargic consciences and forcing us to confront ourselves.\nIt has revealed to Africa, which may still have had its\ndoubts, the limitations of the United Nations.\nThe twentieth century thus ends with this\nacknowledgement, which, though shocking for more than\none reason to those still lulled by the illusions of an age-old\nhumanism, is at least realistic and belongs to the new era\nthat is beginning. It is an acknowledgment that the United\nNations, to which Africa has given so much, cannot do\neverything for the continent in its struggle to quell the\nnumerous hotbeds of tension and ensure its development.\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this fact is self-evident:\nAfrica must recognize this reality and come to terms with\nit.\nThe thirty-fourth Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity, held in\nOuagadougou on 8-10 June 1998, devoted the thrust of its\ndeliberations to this new reality, which challenges and\ncommands Africa to take control of its own destiny.\nAssessing the scope and importance of the\nresponsibilities this entails, and which are theirs to\nassume, the heads of States took the decision to affirm\ntheir common will to focus fully \u2014 more than in the\npast \u2014 on the prevention, management and resolution of\nAfrican conflicts. This commitment will certainly ensure\ngreater visibility both for the Organization of African\nUnity and for the continent\u2019s various regional\norganizations in their search for peaceful solutions to\nthese conflicts.\nThough Africa\u2019s experience in taking control of its\nown affairs is still quite recent, encouraging results have\nbeen recorded in the management and resolution of\ncertain conflicts, results which deserve to be saluted here.\nThe task, therefore, is not beyond the capacity of\nAfricans.\nIt is my ardent wish that this experience be extended\nto the whole continent, to the most ancient crises as well\nas the most recent. From north to south, from east to\nwest, Africa must henceforth more systematically involve\nitself in the management and settlement of conflicts\nwherever prevention was not enough, where it did not\nsucceed in guaranteeing peace.\nTo this end, initiatives to strengthen the continent\u2019s\ncapacity to respond quickly to crises have been generated\nby Africans themselves. The advantage they have over all\nother initiatives is that they are African. In order to be\ndeveloped and implemented, they need the unequivocal\nsupport of the international community. Subregion by\nsubregion, they need to be developed, without exception\nand in harmony.\nPreventing, managing and resolving the conflicts in\nAfrica, whose number and complexity are increasingly\ndisturbing, requires solid and reliable mechanisms,\nappropriate to local conditions, mechanisms dedicated to\nthe cause of peace, without which Africa cannot\nundertake sustainable development.\nClearly, the world\u2019s problems are immense, complex\nand alarming. The extreme difficulty of dealing with the\nestablishment of peace in isolation gives multilateral\ndiplomacy an ever-growing role in the resolution of\nconflicts.\nThe United Nations and regional organizations such\nas the Organization of African Unity can bring a great\ndeal to this task. The OAU, for example, possesses a\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\n17\n\n\nResolution. Created in Cairo in 1993, this Mechanism,\nwhose effectiveness and practicality we are working to\nensure, should to be the crucible in which a genuine\npreventive diplomacy can be forged.\nThat is all the more imperative since the consequences\nof conflicts, whether internal or international, are always\ndevastating.\nAt the institutional level, therefore, we are equipped to\nrespond to conflicts, and we also have the will to do so,\nfor, as I emphasized during the thirty-fourth OAU summit,\n\u201cthe issue of security and peace in Africa is primarily\nof concern to Africans. No mechanism has any chance\nof succeeding effectively over time if it is imposed\nfrom outside.\u201d\nOf course, external solidarity, if it is sincere, will\nalways be welcome, given that in such a complex and\nchanging field concerted and resolute action can only be\nbeneficial. I have already emphasized that the management\nof conflict situations often requires the deployment of a\nlevel of human, material and financial resources beyond the\ncapacities of our countries. Thus, international organizations\nshould continue to show solidarity and partnership with\nAfrica.\nI therefore call upon the United Nations, with its\nwealth of experience, to contribute not only to\nstrengthening structurally the Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution in Africa, but also\nto provide technical and logistical support, since in the end\nwe share the same ideal: assuring for our world the security\nand peace essential to its development and flourishing.\nIn this test of international solidarity, one thing is\ncertain: Africa must definitively and first of all rely upon\nitself. We Africans are aware that in order to be masters of\nour destiny we must forge it ourselves. In response to this\nimperative no sacrifice has been spared by any State of our\ncontinent to establish an internal climate that is conducive\nto growth and sustainable development. After the years of\nuncertainty and stagnation, Africa has entered a new era,\nmarked by clear economic recovery in the wake of bold\nreforms and characterized by greater austerity and\nrationality in the management of public and State affairs.\nThis movement towards transparency in management and\ngood governance has been accompanied by the\nestablishment of homogeneous subregions in which the\ncommon destiny of Africans is daily forged, thanks to the\nsustained harmony of our principles and policies of\nintegration, the ultimate objective of which is the\nestablishment of an African economic community in the\nfirst half of the twenty-first century.\nAt present Africa faces two challenges: peace and\npolitical stability on the one hand, and sustainable\ndevelopment on the other. In their struggle and daily\nefforts to emerge from underdevelopment, African\nGovernments and peoples are not alone. They know how\nto rely on the sincere support of their friends. This\nincludes the operational development system of the\nUnited Nations, which I should like to commend for its\ndedication to the uplifting struggle against poverty and\nother forms of deprivation that afflict African peoples.\nIt is therefore regrettable that the United Nations\nagencies that are at the heart of the struggle for human\nsecurity in Africa \u2014 such as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, to cite only two examples \u2014 are seeing\ntheir financial resources slowly dwindle while the mission\nentrusted to them calls for a redoubling of efforts and\nresources. That is why I call upon all to demonstrate their\ngoodwill by contributing to the operational development\nsystem of the United Nations the resources it needs in\norder to assist Africa in confronting the challenges of\npeace and development.\nThe same goes for the question of debt. It would be\ndesirable for the eligible countries to have their debt\nrescheduled at the same time as they are initiating\nreforms. It hardly needs recalling that debt is an\nunbearable burden for our still fragile economies.\nGlobalization offers us the means and advantages\nrequired to succeed in the boldest undertakings, provided\nthat we clearly define our objectives and involve our\npeoples in the challenge of propelling Africa along the\npath of progress. It is incontrovertible that globalization,\nwhich implies a spirit of partnership, limits the\nindependence and initiatives of States. But can humanity\ncontinue to flourish if the gap between rich and poor\nnations, between the affluent and the destitute within the\nsame nation, grows inexorably?\nThe time has therefore come to rethink seriously the\nresponsibility of international institutions in the regulation\nof the globalized economy in order to ensure a balance\nbetween economic growth and social prosperity. To do\n18\n\n\nthat, it is more than indispensable and more than timely to\nengage in a restructuring of the United Nations, and\nespecially of the Security Council, in order to make it a\ntrue instrument for the application of the principles of\njustice, equity and democracy.\nAfrica accounts for one third of the Members of the\nUnited Nations. That is why it is unacceptable that, after\nmore than 50 years of our Organization\u2019s existence, an\nentire continent \u2014 Africa \u2014 should be absent from the\npermanent membership of the Security Council, which,\nparadoxically, debates problems that are for the most part\nAfrican.\n\nIf the United Nations were to apply the principle of\nequity, would the sanctions against the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya continue despite the opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice and, above all, despite the decisions and\nresolutions of heads of State in the Organization of African\nUnity, the League of Arab States, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement calling\nfor those sanctions to be lifted? Today Security Council\nresolution 1192 (1998) has underscored the primacy of law\nfor resolving this dispute, and the majority of nations within\nour world Organization hope that conditions of transparency\nwill be met so that the trial can be concluded, in the\ninterest of the victims and the Libyan people.\nMoreover, Africa hopes that the Security Council will\ndispatch a mission of inquiry to the Sudan in the wake of\nthe bombing of the pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum.\nAfrica forcefully condemns terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations and calls upon our world Organization\nto create the necessary conditions for a frank debate of this\nissue and for strong and concerted action against this\nphenomenon, while keeping in mind that unresolved angers\nand frustrations born of economic or historical conditions\nrestrict our capability to act.\nIn the same vein, can the United Nations continue to\ndeny the legal and international reality of a State such as\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, whose 22 million women\nand men are excluded from making any contribution to the\nactivities of our Organization?\nI am among those who believe that Africa is on the\npath of hope. I remain convinced that the economic,\npolitical, cultural and social obstacles that confront Africa\ncall forcefully for its children to rediscover the road to\nunity that will allow them to take effective control of\ntheir destiny. Without union, Africa will remain on the\nperiphery of history. Common sense tells us that we\nAfricans must once and for all rid ourselves of that image\nof the outstretched hand that bedevils us and build the\ncovenants of friendship, dignity and pride that will confer\nso much solidarity and generosity. This quest for\nindependence does not deny the importance of solidarity\namong peoples. It means reaching a new understanding of\nhuman rights and the rights of peoples; it means taking on\nthe responsibility of knowing how to remain ourselves.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits current session. I believe that his wisdom and\nexperience will enable him to accomplish his important\nmission with distinction.\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the\ncontribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of the\nGeneral Assembly during the previous session.\nAt present, the international situation is undergoing\nprofound changes. The accelerated trend towards\nmultipolarity has injected new vitality into international\nrelations. Economic globalization is developing very\nquickly, and countries are becoming increasingly\ninterdependent. The development of multipolarity and\nglobalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustment\nof international relations.\n\nBilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non-\nconfrontation, non-alignment and non-targeting against\nthird countries, have been established one after another.\nVarious regional and intercontinental organizations of\ncooperation have become more active than ever before.\nSuch endeavours to seek the establishment of stable,\npragmatic and balanced international relations contribute\nto peace and development as well as to the establishment\nof a fair and equitable new international political and\neconomic order.\n10\n\n\nHowever, we cannot lose sight of the many\nuncertainties still existing in the world.\nThe nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In\nthe post-cold-war period of today, the people of all\ncountries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear\nproliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.\nIt is to be regretted that last May India conducted\nnuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus\nadversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.\nSoon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear\ntests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the\ntension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy\nblow to international nuclear disarmament and the\nmechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This\nhas aroused the great concern of the international\ncommunity. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully\nimplement the Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the five permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, as well as the provisions\nof Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their\nplans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and\nunconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and\nPakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir\nthrough peaceful means.\nIn our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia,\nthe international community faces the pressing task of\nconsolidating and strengthening the international non-\nproliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of\nnuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority\nof the NPT.\nChina has all along stood for the complete prohibition\nand thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994,\nthe Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly\nthat a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons\nshould be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the\nChinese Government has on many occasions called on all\nthe other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten\nto use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and\nnuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a\nconvention on no first use of nuclear weapons through\nnegotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a\nfissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the\nnegotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign\nthe Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the\nChinese Government that China will abide by the\nprovisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming\nnuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies\nof unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and\nunconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons\nagainst non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will\ncontinue to support the Conference on Disarmament in\nGeneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory\nand verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis\nof the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the\nlargest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear\ndisarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate\ncomplete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear\nweapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its\nresponsibility.\nThe East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July\n1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of\nmany countries of the region. Its negative impact is still\nspreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen\nsince last June has added to the difficulty of economic\nrecovery in the region.\nThe crisis occurred in the overall context of\neconomic globalization, and its impact is being felt across\nthe world. Stepping up international cooperation and\nputting an early end to this crisis is not only in the\nimmediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also\nin the interests of the international community as a whole,\nand especially of the developed countries. We hope that\nthose developed countries with important influence on the\nregion\u2019s economy will shoulder their responsibilities and\ntake active, resolute and effective measures to make their\ndue contributions to safeguarding the stability of the\nfinancial order and promoting the recovery and\ndevelopment of the region\u2019s economy.\nFollowing the eruption of the East Asian financial\ncrisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly\nresponsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the\ncountries concerned within the framework arranged by\nInternational Monetary Fund and, at the same time,\nthrough bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall\ninterests of maintaining the stability and development of\nthe region, China has made the decision not to devalue\nthe yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great\npressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the\ngrowing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to\nmaintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain\nunchanged.\nFighting with one heart and one mind, we won the\nbattle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a\nseries of measures to deepen our reform and expand\n11\n\n\ndomestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of\nour economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise\nin this year\u2019s gross domestic product. We firmly believe\nthat with the common efforts of the countries in the region\nand of the rest of the international community, the East\nAsian economy will be able to gradually get out of its\npredicament and return to the road of sound development.\nThe Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate\nfor some time, which has aroused widespread concern in\nthe international community. We are of the view that the\nArab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic\nnegotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and\nlasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental\ninterests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive\nto world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties\nconcerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible\nand pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the\npeace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and\non the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and\nthe agreements already reached. The Chinese Government\nwill, as always, support the Middle East peace process and\nthe efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant\nparties to this end.\nWe are following the developments in the Kosovo\nregion of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the\nparties involved will solve the problem through political\ndialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nYugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the\nBalkans have been hard won and should be cherished all\nthe more by the relevant parties and by the international\ncommunity.\nThe border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\nanother source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will\nbe appropriately resolved by the parties involved through\npeaceful means.\nThe twenty-first century is greeting us. On the\nthreshold of the new century, the United Nations bears\nheavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world\npeace, promoting human progress and establishing a just\nand rational new international political and economic order.\nIt has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end\nof the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints\nand more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented\nopportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and\ncan use its own advantages to play a unique and\nconstructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable\nworld, in establishing a new type of international\nrelationship based on friendship and cooperation and in\ntaking up the common challenges facing mankind.\nChina has consistently held that it is necessary to\ncarry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that\nthe Organization can better keep abreast of the changing\nsituation and serve its numerous Member States. We have\ntaken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform\nin a number of fields promoted by all Member States.\nSome reform measures and recommendations proposed by\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been\napproved by the General Assembly and are now being put\ninto practice. Intense discussions on reform of the\nSecurity Council are also in orderly progress. At present,\nthere are still differences among Member States on quite\na few issues involved in the reform of the Security\nCouncil. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive\napproach and play an active part in the relevant\nconsultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement\nof relevant issues.\nHere, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the\nChinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of\nthe Security Council bears on the interests of all countries\nand so requires a democratic style of work and extensive\nand full consultations. All Member States should have an\nequal right to speak on the question of the reform, and\ntheir reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.\nSecondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich\ncountries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet\nthe concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more\nattention should be given to the interests and aspirations\nof the vast number of developing countries.\nRepresentation should be balanced between the developed\nand the developing countries.\nThirdly, the reform measures are of major\nsignificance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the\nSecurity Council in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. They should be worked out on the basis of the\nrealities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course\nthat the objective of the reform of the Security Council is\nto solve problems rather than to create new sources of\ndiscord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security\nCouncil gains extensive support from Member States, it\nis essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nIn the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously\npromoted the advancement and development of the cause\n12\n\n\nof human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in\nAsia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from\ncolonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark\nsystem of apartheid, won basic political rights and became\nan equal member of the international community. The\nUnited Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international\ninstruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the\nRight to Development, further enriching the content of\nhuman rights. The right to development has been\nuniversally recognized in the international community as an\ninseparable part of basic human rights.\nIn the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken\nplace in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the\nintroduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed\nan ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved\nlegal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the\nrights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese\npeople now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality\nthan ever before and a much fuller and more settled life\nthan in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to\nmake unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to\nstrengthen the legal system, while developing the economy\nso as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to\nthe full.\nThe Chinese Government is active in supporting and\nparticipating in the activities of the United Nations in the\nfield of human rights. China has all along stood for\ninternational cooperation in the field of human rights on the\nbasis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance\nunderstanding, narrow differences, expand common ground\nand strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese\nGovernment is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and\ncooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,\nwith human rights organizations at the national and\ninternational levels.\nLast October, the Chinese Government signed the\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\nRights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese\nGovernment has decided to sign it early next month. This\nonce again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese\nGovernment with respect to promoting and protecting\nhuman rights. China is ready to continue to work with other\ncountries to maintain and increase the current positive\nmomentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote\nthe furtherance of the world cause of human rights.\nThis year is the twentieth anniversary of the\nintroduction of the policy of reform and opening up in\nChina. In these two decades, China has scored\ntremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and\nmodernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our\nnational economy has gained a favourable momentum of\nhigh growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened\nreforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last\nSeptember, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth\nNational Congress, formulated a blueprint for China\u2019s\ncross-century development based on the new\ndevelopments both on the domestic and international\nscene. In March this year, our new State institutions and\nnew Government were formed through elections at the\nfirst session of the ninth National People\u2019s Congress of\nChina. We will build energetically on our political and\neconomic restructuring and carry forward the cause of\nbuilding socialism with Chinese characteristics into the\ntwenty-first century in a comprehensive way.\nChina\u2019s modernization drive requires a stable\ninternational environment of peace. China will continue to\npursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This\npolicy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in\nindependence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard\nworld peace, and to seek common development.\nTo persist in independence and maintain the\ninitiative, we always put our State sovereignty and\nnational security first and never develop relations with\nother countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s sacred\nterritory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the\nupcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide\nuseful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the\nsettlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,\nadhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and\none country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang\nZemin\u2019s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait\nrelations and promoting the process of peaceful\nreunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait\nexchanges and cooperation in various fields; and\nresolutely oppose the creation of the \u201cindependence of\nTaiwan\u201d, \u201ctwo Chinas\u201d and \u201cone China/one, Taiwan\u201d and\nTaiwan\u2019s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.\nWe respect the sovereignty of other countries and\nvigorously support the efforts of all countries in the\nworld, and of developing countries in particular, to defend\ntheir State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our\nown. In handling international relations, we adhere to\nnon-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of\nThird States. We do not go in for military blocs and the\n13\n\n\narms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China\u2019s\ndevelopment will not pose a threat to any other country.\nThe so-called \u201cChina threat\u201d is entirely unfounded and\nfabricated with ulterior motives.\nTo safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for\nthe maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is\nour consistent view that State-to-State relations should be\nhandled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful\ncoexistence, transcending differences in social systems and\nideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests\nand, at the same time, respect those of others and\ncontinuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by\nseeking the convergent points of common interests. With\nregard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary\nto persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and\nstrive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by\nresorting to force or the threat of force.\nIt is essential to completely reject the mentality of the\ncold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve\ninternational and regional security issues through consensus\nand participation on an equal footing. We in China stand\nfor the equality of all countries, big or small, and for\naccelerated democratization of international relations. World\naffairs should be handled through consultation by all\ncountries, and no country should impose its own will on\nothers.\nTo seek common development, peace is the\nprerequisite of development and development is the basis of\npeace. In today\u2019s world, where the economy is increasingly\nglobalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order\nto achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside\nworld is China\u2019s long-standing basic State policy. As a\nhuge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of\nthe trend of economic globalization and be even more\nactive in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop\ntrade and expand scientific and technological exchanges\nwith all countries on the basis of equality and mutual\nbenefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches\nimportance to and actively participates in the activities of\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)\nand the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the\nestablishment and development of friendly exchanges and\ncooperation with other global and intercontinental or\nregional organizations for economic cooperation.\nChina continues to take a positive attitude towards\njoining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to\nunremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified\nfor entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations\nhave dragged on and on with no decision having been\nmade. China is a developing country, and we can\nnegotiate China\u2019s entry into the WTO only on this basis,\nin accordance with the principle of balancing rights and\nobligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned\nwill take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up\nexcessive demands and work for an early conclusion of\nthe relevant negotiations. China\u2019s joining the WTO will\nbenefit all its members and make the multilateral trade\nmechanism complete and more balanced.\nBefore I conclude my speech, please allow me to\nuse the forum of the United Nations to brief you on\nChina\u2019s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing\nto such factors as abnormal climate changes this year,\ncatastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang,\nSonghua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the\nsubmerged regions, the duration of the floods and the\nseriousness of the disaster they caused were something\nrarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of\npeople\u2019s lives and their safety, the Chinese Government\nmobilized forces from all sectors across the country and\norganized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out\nbattle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the\nassaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the\nsafety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and\nmajor cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of\nlife and property was kept to a minimum.\nAt present, the Chinese Government is sparing no\neffort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has\nstarted reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We\nare taking every measure possible, with full confidence,\nto ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread\nepidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and\nthat none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas\nwill drop out from school or be deprived of education. In\nthe course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the\ngreat flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to\npush forward our reform and opening up and the socialist\nmodernization drive.\nSince China was hit by the disastrous floods, a\nnumber of countries and international organizations and\ncommunities have sent messages to express sympathy and\nsolicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China.\nI wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the\nChinese Government and people, our most sincere\ngratitude to them.\nThe world of today is a world of interdependence.\nThe promotion of peace, cooperation and development has\n14\n\n\nbecome the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and\nwork together to bring into the twenty-first century a world\nof peace, security and stability in the interest of\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau,\nI am pleased to extend our congratulations to you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-third session. I am particularly pleased because\nit is unanimously agreed that you have exceptional\nintellectual, political and diplomatic qualities which will\nensure the success of our deliberations. It also gives me\npleasure to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, and to thank him for his dynamism and\ninitiative and for the integrity which he displayed\nthroughout his mandate.\nI wish to reiterate to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, our appreciation for the tangible results we have\nseen in the Organization since his election, and to\nencourage him to persevere with the same determination\nin implementing his reform programme, which we\nwholeheartedly support.\nAs we prepare to enter the new millennium, it is\nimportant to be aware of the increasing interdependence\nof nations, large and small, and of the consequences of\nglobalization, so that through fruitful dialogue at the\nglobal level, we may together find appropriate responses\nto the numerous challenges facing us, particularly the\nfight against international terrorism. Poverty,\nunderdevelopment and the major pandemics must not\nremain the sole responsibility of the countries affected by\nthese scourges, because for tomorrow\u2019s world to be stable\nit must be united founded on the principles of social\njustice and the equality of peoples and nations. Hence, the\nprimacy of law must continue to guide us in seeking\n\n\nlasting solutions to the numerous regrettable conflicts\nthroughout the world. We are pleased to note that all the\npeoples of the world share a determination to live in peace,\nwithin their national borders, with their neighbours and the\nrest of the international community.\nMy country welcomes the positive developments in the\nLockerbie affair, which has been a matter of concern to us\nfor many years. It has been the subject of decisions by\nregional organizations, such as the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the League of Arab States, as well as the\nNon-Aligned Movement. We hope that the parties involved\nwill spare no effort to ensure that justice is done in\nconditions of fairness and impartiality, with all the\nnecessary guarantees, taking into account the recognized\nrights of each party. We feel that the clarifications called\nfor by the Libyan authorities are legitimate, because they\nare based on the objective criteria of neutrality and fair play\nwhich govern any judicial procedure worthy of the name.\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau was admitted as a\nfully fledged member of the United Nations in September\n1974, following a lengthy and difficult struggle for national\nliberation. For almost a quarter of a century we have been\ncommitted to respecting and defending the principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, because they are\nessential guidelines for active participation in international\nlife and for the building of our young nation.\nEarly on we understood that in order to give shape to\nour political independence we needed to establish the\nconditions for harmonious economic development from\nwhich all sections of our population could benefit. With the\nassistance of the international community, therefore, our\nyoung State focused on ways and means to build a land of\nfreedom and peace.\nIt goes without saying that 11 years of struggle for\nnational liberation scarred our people and left an indelible\nmark on their minds and bodies. Since Guinea-Bissau is a\npoor country with very limited resources, everything needed\nto be built, despite the fact that we did not have the\nfinancial means or the necessary skills. Therefore, inspired\nby the courage that enabled us to galvanize ourselves to\nfree our country, we set to the task determined to create the\nright conditions for the full development of our citizens and\nthe improvement of their living standards.\nOver the past four years we have succeeded in laying\nthe foundations of a democratic State based on the rule of\nlaw and respect for human rights. As members of the\nAssembly know, building a nation is a long-term task\nrequiring both determination and perseverance. Guinea-\nBissau, which is among the poorest countries of the\nworld, is no exception to that rule. Over the past two\ndecades we have focused on consolidating our national\nunity by strengthening the ties of solidarity that unite our\ncitizens, whose maturity had enabled them to wage, and\nsucceed in, one of the most exemplary national liberation\nstruggles in Africa. It is precisely this awareness of\nbelonging to the same people that has enabled all sectors\nof our population to unite and work hand in hand for the\ndevelopment of the country and the well-being of all.\nTherefore, since its independence in 1973, despite the\neconomic difficulties all States face, Guinea-Bissau has\nlived in peace and has known a period of great political\nstability.\nHowever, since 7 June our country has experienced\ntragedy, previously unimaginable, just when it was\nbeginning to make notable progress with regard to\ndemocracy and respect for human rights and in the\neconomy.\nAn unprecedented crisis for which we were not even\nminimally prepared has deeply shaken and paralysed our\ncountry for some four months now, endangering the\nfoundations of the state of law and the existence of\ndemocratic institutions in the Republic. The act of\naggression by a party of our country\u2019s national army is a\nserious violation of the constitutional provisions in force\nin Guinea-Bissau. The international community, in\nparticular the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nthe United Nations, have unreservedly condemned this act\nof aggression.\nFrom this podium, we wish to thank the United\nNations family for the solidarity and support it has\nprovided to the President of the Republic, Mr. Jo\u00e3o\nBernardo Vieira; the legal Government of the Republic of\nGuinea-Bissau; its leaders; and especially, the innocent,\nvictimized population. I should like in particular to\nconvey our gratitude to the neighbouring countries of\nGuinea-Bissau for their active solidarity with our people.\nOn behalf of my Government, I specifically thank the\nauthorities of Senegal, Guinea, Cape Verde, the Gambia\nand Portugal for having rapidly created an appropriate\nrapid-response team to evacuate citizens and foreign\nnationals who wished to leave, especially our own\ndesperate compatriots, a great number of whom have\nsought refuge and safe haven in neighbouring countries.\nEach of these brother countries has distinguished itself\nadmirably in an exemplary display of compassion and\n2\n\n\nhumanity. I wish to thank them most sincerely on behalf of\nour Government and all of my compatriots.\nI also wish to pay tribute to the courage of my own\nfellow citizens and to reiterate, on behalf of our\nGovernment, our keen awareness of the difficulties they\nface and of the need to ease their suffering by finding a\nspeedy solution to the current crisis, so that peace and\nstability may be restored to our homeland, and by\nestablishing conditions to allow our people to return to their\ncountry.\nIt is its desire to find a peaceful and negotiated\nsolution to this crisis that has inspired the Government of\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau in its contacts with the\nmembers of the self-proclaimed military junta. Indeed,\nthrough the joint mediation of members of the Community\nof Portuguese-Speaking Countries and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, we have signed a\nceasefire and begun a constructive dialogue, which we will\npursue on the basis of recognition and respect for the\nconstitutional legality of our country and the need to work\ntogether to restore peace and stability.\nWe are grateful to all people of goodwill who have\ncome forward, both in Africa and overseas, to assist us in\novercoming all of these difficulties and in finding a final\nsolution to the conflict in Guinea-Bissau.\nThe people of Guinea-Bissau are peaceful. They have\nage-old relations of friendship and brotherhood with their\nneighbours in the Republics of Guinea, Senegal and the\nGambia. These relations are based on the common destiny\nwhich history and geography have bequeathed us. It is a\nprecious legacy that present and future generations must\npreserve and defend in the conviction that their identity and\ntheir social and cultural values will endure. It is this same\ncommitted and unfailing solidarity which enabled us to free\nourselves from the yoke of colonialism, as did our brothers\nin Guinea and Senegal.\nAs we have already had the opportunity to point out,\nthe presence of Guinean and Senegalese troops in Guinea-\nBissau is based on the implementation of bilateral\nagreements duly signed and ratified. In addition to the\nexistence of an unquestionably legal framework, however,\nit is important to know and recall that, through their\nintervention, the Guinean and Senegalese troops bravely\nassisted their comrades in arms in Guinea to overcome an\nattempted coup that has been condemned by the OAU, the\nUnited Nations and the entire international community.\nThey have made a courageous contribution to the\nmaintenance of constitutional legality and democracy in\nGuinea-Bissau. Allow me here to pay tribute to them for\ntheir decisive action and to offer them our full gratitude.\nFor some four months, Guinea-Bissau has been\nexperiencing a major tragedy that has brought great loss\nof human life, serious material damage and much\nsuffering to our people, who have been internally\ndisplaced and made refugees in neighbouring countries,\nCape Verde and Portugal.\nOnce again, I wish to thank the Assembly for its\nsolidarity with our country and people. Its assistance is\nvalued and will be valuable in healing the wounds and\nassisting all the citizens of our country to understand each\nother better and work together for the common future of\ntheir homeland. I can assure members that we will spare\nno effort to ensure that, through dialogue and joint\nendeavours, peace will return to a Guinea-Bissau united\nand reconciled in solidarity.\nMore than ever, we recognize the need to establish\na pluralistic democracy in a state of law and an\negalitarian society that will guarantee full respect for civil,\npolitical and human rights. Today more than ever, we are\naware of the importance of peace in our country and in\nother conflicted regions of the world where peoples of the\nsame country have been torn apart. I am thinking in\nparticular of the fratricidal wars which for some years\nnow have ravaged other African countries, Angola and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in particular.\nAt a time when we are preparing to commemorate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, it is appropriate to proclaim our complete\ncommitment to the fundamental principles of democracy,\ngood governance and respect for human rights, which\nunderpin our search for harmonious development and a\nbetter standard of living. The international community, the\nUnited Nations in particular, has always heeded the\naspirations of the people of Guinea-Bissau. With its\nsolidarity, it has made our struggle for national liberation\nits own battle for the emancipation of peoples throughout\nthe world. Today, as in the past, we need its support to\nrebuild our country and restore confidence and hope to\nour compatriots, who impatiently await the moment when\nthey can return to their country, their homes, their\nfamilies, their friends and their workplaces \u2014 to peace\nand stability."

        "file_text": "Allow me, on behalf of\nthe Bulgarian delegation, to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success in\nguiding this important session to tangible results.\nI would like also to express our appreciation to\nMr. Udovenko for the proficiency and insight with which\nhe presided over the fifty-second session.\nThe Republic of Bulgaria, as an associated country,\nhas aligned itself with the statement on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, delivered by Mr. Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel,\nVice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nAustria.\nWhile the search for new approaches and responses\nto the processes of globalization confronts humanity with\nnew challenges, existing cases of conflict, unrest and\nunderdevelopment bear the mark of the divisions and\nconfrontations of past decades. The question we have to\naddress now is whether the next millennium will be one\nof continued unrest and confrontation or one of peace and\nprosperity for all United Nations Member States, big or\nsmall.\nGlobalization and interdependence are bringing\nprofound changes to the world we live in. An increasing\nnumber of issues, such as the economic and financial\ncrisis, organized crime, terrorism and regional conflicts,\ncannot be effectively resolved by individual countries.\nTherefore, international cooperation is more necessary\nthan ever.\nToday we are combining our efforts against the new\nglobal threat, terrorism. But we must not forget that\nterrorism appears mainly in unstable regions or weak\ncountries, and from there spreads to the rest of the world.\nThat is why the problems of such unstable countries can\nneither remain their own responsibility, nor even\nproblems of their regions. The problems seem to be much\nmore global. The question today is how to combat the\ncriminal world, how to manage crisis and regional\nconflicts, how to feed and shelter refugees. Tomorrow the\nquestion will be how to guarantee democratic stability\nthrough long-term engagements. The other approach is\nonly to react to the consequences, thus adding new\nproblems. Such an approach does not solve the problem,\nbut becomes part of it; moreover the problem is\nmultiplied through its negative influence on neighbouring\ncountries.\nWe also believe that economic security is an\nessential part of the framework in which our efforts to\nmake a better world are made. We are convinced that\nsecurity can be guaranteed not by \u201chot money\u201d, but only\nthrough real, long-term investments, which are crucial for\na successful economic restructuring.\n27\n\n\nBulgaria has managed to gain some knowledge and\nexperience in handling the problems of the reform process.\nIn the past year and a half the Government has managed to\nachieve: first, economic stability as a basis for moving\nforward with structural reform and sustainable economic\ngrowth; secondly, modernization of the public\nadministration; and, thirdly, efficient enforcement of the\nrule of law in civil society.\nResolute steps have been taken, in compliance with\nthe Government programme \u201cBulgaria \u2014 2001\u201d, to\ntranslate into practice the new foreign policy priorities. At\nits core are the integration of Bulgaria into the European\nand transatlantic political, economic and defence structures,\nand the creation of a climate of confidence, stability and\ncooperation in South-Eastern Europe.\nWe are now engaged in active diplomatic efforts\naimed at promoting the principles of democracy and\nstability in the region of South-Eastern Europe in order to\ncontribute to the peaceful settlement of conflicts. I would\nalso like to stress that my country has already achieved\nsignificant progress in another important area, combating\norganized crime and corruption and promoting regional\ncooperation in this field.\nLet me now address the complex situation in the\nBalkans. I would like to note the progress made in the\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement. We consider that\nthe extended presence of the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\nwould contribute to the consolidation of peace and stability\nin this region.\nBulgaria is particularly concerned about the continuing\ntension in Kosovo. The crisis has reached a point where\nthere is no more room for general statements and palliative\nsolutions. The conflict in Kosovo has resulted in\nthousands of civilian casualties. There is a serious threat of\ndeepening the crisis and a substantial risk of spillover to\nother parts of South-Eastern Europe. We are convinced that\nthe only credible instrument for solving the problem is\nnegotiations between the parties involved, which have to\nexamine in a responsible manner all proposals for a\npeaceful settlement. We support Security Council resolution\n1199 (1998) adopted yesterday.\nIt is worth pointing out that as early as last February\nBulgaria proposed that the countries generating stability in\nthe region should unite their efforts in search of a peaceful\nsolution to this problem. The joint declarations of the\nForeign Ministers of countries of South-Eastern Europe,\nadopted on the initiative of Bulgaria, reflect the will of\nthese countries to make their contribution to the efforts of\nthe Contact Group. They also illustrate the new spirit in\nrelations between the States in the region and their\nresponsible approach to security and stability. For the first\ntime in many years our countries managed to put aside\ntheir differences so as to elaborate and express a common\nposition on a problem of immediate concern. This\napproach sets the groundwork for the establishment of a\npolitico-diplomatic mechanism for crisis management and\nprevention.\nIn our view, those States which would like to\ncontribute to stability and security in the region have to\ntake into consideration the interests and positions of the\ncountries situated there. A common understanding has\nbeen expressed that any measures aimed at settling the\nproblems of the region, sanctions included, should take\ninto account the political and economic stability of South-\nEastern Europe. They should not infringe upon the\ninterests of the countries involved. Therefore, we believe\nthat efficient measures should be of a political, and not of\nan economic, character.\n28\n\n\nAn issue of special relevance for Bulgaria and also, I\nbelieve, for other countries of the region, is the negative\nimpact on the national economy of the strict implementation\nof the economic sanctions imposed until recently by the\nSecurity Council on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As\nis well known, Bulgaria strictly abided by the Council?s\ndecisions, suffering as a result economic losses which have\nalmost been equal to Bulgaria?s foreign debt for three years.\nGiven the continued relevance of that issue internationally,\nBulgaria supports the view that since all provisions of the\nCharter are of equal importance, assistance to third States\naffected by sanctions has to be taken into consideration\ntogether with the imposition of sanctions. The elaboration\nof a concrete United Nations mechanism for this purpose is\ntherefore of the utmost importance.\nIt is incumbent upon the United Nations to find ways\nand means of alleviating the negative consequences of\nsanctions with regard to third States. It is our view that\ncloser and more direct participation in the whole process by\nall third States which could be adversely affected by the\nimposition of sanctions is necessary. We are confident that\ndiscussion of this issue at the present session will yield\nmore concrete results in accordance with the decisions\nalready adopted and the report of the Secretary-General to\nbe submitted under resolution 52/162.\nWe are convinced that lasting stability in South-\nEastern Europe is possible only through multilateral security\ncooperation coupled with effective economic,\ninfrastructural, cultural, information and other integrated\nlinks to other parts of Europe. In this regard, the expansion\nof the European and transatlantic organizations to South-\nEastern Europe will create a belt of security in the area and\nprevent possible regional crises in the future.\nAs an integral part of Europe, Bulgaria regards our\naccelerated accession to the European Union and full\nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) as an expression of our political choice based on\nbroad public support. These priorities are embedded in the\nnational security concept approved by the Bulgarian\nparliament last April. Since Bulgaria is determined to\npromote and enhance the values of democracy, we are\ncertainly interested in ensuring that these values become\nwidely accepted throughout South-Eastern Europe.\nThe Republic of Bulgaria welcomes its inclusion in the\nprocess of enlargement of the European Union, together\nwith other associated countries of Central and Eastern\nEurope and Cyprus. The Bulgarian Government is fully\naware that our accession aspirations are contingent on the\nsuccess of the domestic, economic and legislative reforms.\nIt is against this background that a national strategy for\naccession to the European Union, outlining the main\nactivities of the country from a long-term perspective,\nwas adopted last March.\nThe Bulgarian Government has developed a clear-cut\nnational strategy to meet the criteria for NATO\nmembership, based on a comprehensive national\nprogramme of preparation which is being constantly\nupdated and optimized. Bulgaria has the political will and\nis undertaking concrete steps to fulfil in regional terms\nthe objectives of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council\nand the enhanced Partnership for Peace. Our positive\nattitude is reflected in the ongoing regional political\ndialogue and the practical follow-up measures to enhance\nregional security and defence cooperation in South-\nEastern Europe.\nWe consider multilateral confidence and security-\nbuilding measures to be an important aspect of political\ncooperation in the region. An important example of this\ncooperation is the initiative to create a multinational peace\nforce in South-Eastern Europe. In the course of the\nnegotiations on this project, Bulgaria proposed hosting the\njoint headquarters of the force in the Bulgarian city of\nPlovdiv. The establishment of the force will strengthen\nthe spirit of confidence and cooperation in the region.\nAnother key aspect of regional cooperation is the\nprocess of good-neighbourly relations, stability, security\nand cooperation in South-Eastern Europe initiated at the\nMeeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\nCountries of South-Eastern Europe in Sofia in 1996.\nAnnual ministerial meetings have been held since then, as\nwell as a number of specialized expert meetings devoted\nto issues of common interest in various fields, including\ntransport, energy, transborder cooperation, combating\norganized crime and drug-trafficking.\nClosely linked to the maintenance of international\npeace and security is the fight against terrorism and\ninternational crime. We condemn all terrorist acts and\nlament the loss of life and the destruction inflicted by\nthem. The most recent deplorable examples of such acts\nwere the horrible bomb attacks in some African countries.\nWe share the view that the threat of terrorism requires a\ndecisive and joint response by the whole international\ncommunity. Bulgaria supports the activities of the United\nNations aimed at setting norms and standards for the fight\nagainst terrorism and international crime through\n29\n\n\nnegotiating various legal instruments and creating the\nappropriate institutions for this purpose.\nWe consider that successfully combating terrorism and\norganized crime in some countries cannot be achieved\nthrough the efforts of their Governments alone. It requires\nthe effective involvement of other States, which have the\nmeans and the experience in this field. Bulgaria fully\nsupports the recent initiative by France and Great Britain to\nconvene a high-level conference in London this autumn\naimed at depriving terrorists of their support. We note with\nappreciation that on 18 July this year, the Diplomatic\nConference in Rome adopted the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court. I would like to reiterate my country?s\nconfidence that the establishment in the foreseeable future\nof the International Criminal Court will be an efficient step\ntowards deterring possible perpetrators from committing\nterrorist acts.\nThe broadening of the human aspect of development\nthrough democracy and participation has been widely\naccepted and has become one of the priorities of United\nNations activities. This year we celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand the fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action. The principle of the indivisibility of\nuniversally recognized civil, political, economic, social and\ncultural rights continues to be a key element of today?s\nsystem for the promotion and protection of human rights\nand freedoms. The designation of 1998 as the International\nYear for Human Rights could stimulate a further\nrestructuring of United Nations human rights activities,\nstrengthening the staff of and securing adequate financial\nresources for the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. In this respect we would\nlike to commend the relevant measures taken by the High\nCommissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and to reiterate our\nsupport for her efforts to this end.\nBetter implementation of international standards could\nbe achieved by improving the existing mechanisms and by\nopen dialogue on most sensitive issues, including those\nrelated to human rights in individual States. Accordingly,\nthe Bulgarian Government attaches great importance to the\nenjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians living abroad\nand considers respect for their rights to be an essential\nelement for the enhancement of bilateral relations.\nBulgaria supports the ongoing process of reform\npursued consistently by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\nand aimed at the streamlining and strengthening of the\nOrganization and at making it more efficient and responsive\nto the new realities. One of the substantial issues of\noverall United Nations reform is the question of\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council. Bulgaria reiterates its willingness to\nsupport such an enlargement of the Council, which could\nguarantee its effectiveness and enhance its capacity to\nmaintain international peace and security. In our view the\nenlargement should envisage the preservation of the\nbalance between the permanent and non-permanent\nmembers, as well as among regional groups. As the\nmembership of the Group of Eastern European States has\ndoubled in the last decade, an additional non-permanent\nseat for this group should be secured. A decision on the\nenlargement of the Council and on its working methods\nshould be supported by the broadest possible consensus,\nincluding all the Council?s permanent members.\nBulgaria attaches great importance to the activities\nof the United Nations in the field of sustainable\ndevelopment and is closely following the United Nations\ndialogue and the activities of United Nations bodies and\nagencies on the issues of demography, social\ndevelopment, women and narcotic drugs. The special\nsession of the General Assembly on narcotic drugs, held\nin June of this year, merits particular mention in this\nregard. That session reflected the determination of\nMember States to combine their efforts in the fight\nagainst drugs, and its results contributed to the common\neffort to achieve sustainable development.\nAs a country with an economy in transition, Bulgaria\ncooperates actively with the United Nations system of\nspecialized agencies and programmes. Our interest is to\ndevelop this cooperation further. We are looking forward\nto more streamlined activities thanks to the potential of\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for\ncapacity-building and assistance in the development and\nexecution of joint projects. At the same time, the basic\nprinciples of universality and primary responsibility of\nGovernments for the process should be preserved. In this\nregard the system of resident coordinators and the effort\nto make this more operational will play an important role.\nHere I would like to express our satisfaction with the\nperformance of the UNDP office in Sofia.\nFor Bulgaria, development and economic growth will\nbe impossible without full participation in world\neconomic and financial exchanges. In our opinion, the\nUnited Nations and its institutions could be more strongly\ninvolved in the solution of the specific problems of\neconomic transition and reforms.\n\n\nDisarmament issues continue to have an important\nplace in overall efforts to secure a better world for future\ngenerations. We agree with the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, that disarmament is at the centre of our mission of\npeace and development, and we welcome his decision to re-\nestablish the Department for Disarmament Affairs. The\nBulgarian Government attaches high priority to international\nefforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nWe call for an early entry into force of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an important step in\nthat direction, and support the decision of the Conference\non Disarmament to establish an ad hoc committee to\nconduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. In\nthis context, we were deeply concerned by the nuclear tests\nconducted by India and by Pakistan earlier this year.\nBulgaria has associated itself with statements by the\npresidency of the European Union calling on India and\nPakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and to sign the CTBT, as well as\nto participate in negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty with the aim of maintaining a strong global non-\nproliferation regime.\nWe favour the strengthening of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling\nof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\nTheir Destruction, and believe that further acceleration of\nthe negotiations and an early conclusion of the protocol to\nthe Convention is required.\nAs a State party to the Convention on the Prohibition\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, Bulgaria\nwould like to contribute to enlarging the number of\naccessions to the Convention in order to achieve recognition\nof the prohibition of chemical weapons as a universal norm\nof international law. As a concrete effort to this end,\nBulgaria will host a regional seminar on the issue later this\nmonth.\nWith regard to conventional arms, anti-personnel\nlandmines are widely recognized as a pernicious weapon\nwhich indiscriminately kills and maims hundreds of\nthousands of people worldwide. Convinced of the need\nfor a total prohibition of anti-personnel mines, on 29 July\nthis year the Bulgarian Parliament ratified the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, thus contributing to its early entry into force.\nWe are also ready to contribute to the efforts of the\ninternational community to reduce conventional weapons,\nincluding small arms, and especially their excessive and\ndestabilizing accumulation in areas of conflict. We regard\nuniversal participation in the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms as an important step towards effective\ntransparency, both on a regional and a global scale.\nIn the context of the new challenges in the field of\ninternational peace and security, United Nations\npeacekeeping operations continue to be an essential\nelement in the Organization?s activities. My country\nappreciates the efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure\nwide support for these and to put in place the necessary\narrangements that will enable the United Nations to\ndeploy peacekeeping forces rapidly and effectively in\nareas of conflict. We are convinced that the new\ngeneration of peacekeeping operations should include in\ntheir mandates a proportional combination of political,\nmilitary, humanitarian, reconstruction and other relevant\nactivities. In this regard, we believe that there are still\nunused opportunities to strengthen United Nations\ncooperation with regional organizations in the field of\npreventive diplomacy, crisis management and\npeacekeeping.\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to declare my\ncountry?s readiness to cooperate actively with all other\nMember States in the successful implementation of the\nlofty goals of the present session of the General\nAssembly. We are confident that our discussions on the\nimportant agenda items before us will be translated into\npractical measures."

        "file_text": "Today\u2019s world offers\none clear lesson: to survive and prosper, we have to work\ntogether better. That much is clear.\nWe share a global environment. We depend on each\nother for development and prosperity. Regional conflicts\naffect us all. Our peoples suffer together under the\nshadows of drugs and terrorism.\nWe can no longer separate what we want to achieve\nwithin our own borders from what we face across our\nborders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recently\ncan inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that fear\ntogether.\nAnd if our finance, our trade, media,\ncommunications and even our culture are, day by day,\nmore and more transnational, it would be strange and\npotentially dangerous if our politics remained locked in\nthe old compartments built just after the Second World\nWar. If the challenge is international, then the response\nmust be international too. We must launch a new era of\ninternational partnership in which we modernize those\ninstitutions that allow us to cooperate and to work\ntogether.\nThe United Nations has a real record of\nachievement. That is true. But it is true also that it has\nhad its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectively\nwhen brutality was abroad. It has sometimes delivered\nwords when action was needed.\nBut the United Nations is no more than its Member\nStates. Its failures are our failures. The values of the\nUnited Nations Charter are as valid now as when they\nwere written. But we have to find new ways of applying\nthem.\nSo I believe in the United Nations, but I also believe\nit must modernize, and do so urgently. All parts of the\nUnited Nations need proper accountability to go with\nsecure funding, better management and more effective\ncoordination in all their activities.\nOur Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it is\nnow up to us, the Member States, to give him our full\nsupport. We must not allow reform in the United Nations\nto falter.\nAnd let me emphasize today that we need to\nstrengthen too the authority of the Security Council. This\nmeans broadening its composition: new permanent\nseats \u2014 for the developing world as well as for Germany\nand Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be an\nunacceptable compromise. We have been talking about\nthis now for five years. It is time for decisions.\n28\n\n\nWe face many challenges, but none more immediate\nthan the contagion of recession spreading from those\ncountries currently in difficulty to affect the wider world\neconomy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts to\nimpose new panoplies of controls on international capital\nmovements, or in a retreat from open trade. Rather, we\nmust all recognize that the absence of proper financial\nstructures and disciplines in individual countries, coupled\nwith a lack of transparency, will be punished by the\nmarkets sooner or later.\nHowever, we can act. We can devise new mechanisms\nto support a process of change: rules to encourage greater\ntransparency in international and national financial dealings;\nbetter supervision and regulation of financial operators;\nadequate resources for the international financial institutions\nto deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reform\nprogrammes for countries in difficulty, programmes that\ntake account of the social effects of the restructuring we are\nasking for.\nThe only way to tackle such complex problems is a\nnew, high-level, international collaborative effort. Global\nproblems will require global solutions. As Chairman of the\nG-8, Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessary\nlook at the international financial architecture and how it\ncan be improved for a new age. This is a priority, I believe,\nfor us all.\nHowever, we know that, unlike in the 1950s, this\ncannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Getting\nthe financial framework right is only a start. We must\ncreate the conditions for sustainable development in all our\ncountries.\nThe international community has set itself exacting\ntargets. Most important is the target to halve the proportion\nof people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Our\nown development effort is now geared to the eradication of\npoverty. I told last year\u2019s special session that we would\nreverse the decline in our development assistance. Recently\nwe have announced that we are raising our development\nbudget by \u00a31.6 billion, and our support for health,\neducation and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. We\nhave helped pay for the World Health Organization\u2019s\ncampaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put our\nmoney where our mouth is.\nOf course, however, these development programmes\nonly work if the conditions are right, and too much money\nhas been wasted over the years. That is again why the work\nthe United Nations is doing to create strong development\npartnerships is so important and must be given our full\nbacking. I call today on all parts of the United Nations\nsystem, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the\nWorld Trade Organization, to give top priority to effective\ncoordination of their development efforts. The poor of\nthis world will otherwise be the losers.\nIf we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to\nensure that the least developed countries benefit from this\nglobal economy. That means, for example, letting them\nsell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. It\nmeans actively helping them benefit from globalization.\nAnd it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism.\nThe European Union is committed to zero tariffs for\nthese countries by the year 2000. And I would urge all\ndeveloped countries to follow suit.\nWe also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest\ncountries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate to\nspeed up assistance for those in the debt trap who are\ngenuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year\n2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should have\nembarked on a systematic process of debt reduction, with\nthe aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. But\nwe need to make sure it happens. Again, a huge\ncollaborative effort between the countries represented here\ntoday will be needed.\nDevelopment must not be at the expense of the\nenvironment. We all know this. But, again, this is a\nchallenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-run\nthing. Buenos Aires will be hard work, but it has to work.\nCountries with the biggest emissions must come forward\nquickly with credible plans to meet their Kyoto\ncommitments. We in Britain will shortly publish a\nconsultation paper on how we will meet our obligations.\nAnd I hope that others will come forward and do the\nsame.\nThe world has high expectations of the United\nNations as the guardian of global peace and security. The\nUnited Nations should not get involved if regional\norganizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. But\nsometimes we must demonstrate collective global will.\nAnd if we act, we must act decisively. Clear principles\nmust be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly.\nFirst, prevention is always better than cure. The\nresources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared to\nthe expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire.\nThe United Nations is building up its capacity in this\n29\n\n\narea, but it needs more support \u2014 and again Britain\npledges to play its part.\nSecondly, where we do have to send in the Blue\nHelmets, they should be given a clear and achievable task.\nThere must be no repeat of Bosnia, where peacekeepers\nwere inserted into a live conflict and told to make safe\nareas safe. But they were not given the means to do so.\nUnited Nations peacekeepers need a way out as well\nas a way in. They must have the tools to do the job, and\nclear and effective command.\nThirdly, the United Nations needs to be able to act and\nrespond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating,\nunderpin a fragile truce, save lives. Again, we in Britain are\ntrying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain\u2019s armed\nforces following our Strategic Defence Review is\ntransforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping and\nhumanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid-\nreaction forces, additional strategic lift and better logistics\ncapability.\nI can announce today that within six months we will\nconclude a specific agreement with the United Nations to\nensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offer\nwhen it is needed \u2014 the first such agreement by a\npermanent member.\nFourthly, peacekeeping has to be accompanied from\nthe start by peace-building, to restore justice, democratic\ninstitutions, prosperity and human rights. The Security\nCouncil has to deal with the symptoms of conflict, not\nsimply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of the\nUnited Nations, the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again, I will\nbe asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposals\ndealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict to\nmake this a reality.\nToo many of those conflicts sill abound. There are few\nhigher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakes\nregion. The Middle East peace process remains an apparent\ndeadlock. We have managed to make progress in Northern\nIreland, and the support of the world community in our\ndoing so has given us great strength and courage to carry\non. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support, and I hope\nthat the world will continue it. I believe now is the time for\na further move forward in the Middle East, too. Again, we\nin Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about.\nI want to focus, however, on one other area of\nurgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that, yet\nagain, the security forces of President Milosevic\u00b4 are\nignoring the clear will of the international community and\ninflicting brutality and repression on those they claim to\nsee as fellow citizens. Of course, we recognize that the\nunacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo Liberation\nArmy have contributed to the present appalling situation.\nBut nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forcible\ncreation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.\nWe have some clear responsibilities in this situation\nas an international community. First, we must make it\nclear that our patience with broken promises \u2014 phoney\nassurances that are not honoured \u2014 is exhausted.\nContinuation of military repression will inevitably lead to\na new kind of response. Secondly, we must impress on\nboth sides the need to negotiate, with a realistic\nappreciation of what is possible, and point the way to a\nmutually acceptable solution. Thirdly, we must make it\nclear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarian\nneeds of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent, by any\nmeans necessary, the humanitarian disaster which we can\nsee just over the horizon as winter approaches.\nWe propose a new Security Council resolution\ncalling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding an\nurgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitants\nof Kosovo. It should be adopted this week, and President\nMilosevic\u00b4 would ignore such a resolution at his peril.\nThe international community faces another serious\nchallenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous in\ninsisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the United\nNations, and Kofi Annan courageously reached an\nimportant agreement with the Iraqi leadership about the\nUnited Nations Special Commission earlier this year.\nAgain, this agreement has to be honoured, and we will\nplay our part in ensuring that it is.\nFinally, we face two global scourges which can\nundermine our institutions and, indeed, our way of life:\ndrugs and terrorism. We all know the growing links\nbetween drugs and crime and instability in so many\ncountries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have on\nall who come near them \u2014 growers, smugglers, pushers\nand users alike. We have, as we know, to tackle every\nlink of the drugs chain, but we are in danger of losing\nsight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If we\nare honest with ourselves, this is a war that we are risking\nlosing, but we must win. Britain, again, is spending a\n30\n\n\nfurther \u00a3200 million at the national level on our priorities,\nbut our collective efforts need a much stronger focus.\nWe are not short of organizations looking at this\nproblem; indeed, there may well be too many. But we are\ndesperately short of results: cutting supply lines, eliminating\nillicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drug\ndealers. We have a new instrument, the convention against\norganized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuary\nfor the proceeds of crime. We must demand together that\nthose countries root out the traffickers and their dirty\nmoney \u2014 hit the drug barons where it hurts. The\nconvention will provide practical means to achieve this, but\nthe negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the task\nof completing them by the millennium, at the latest.\nThe fight against terrorism has also taken on a new\nurgency. The past year\u2019s global roll-call of terror includes\nLuxor, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi, Omagh and many others.\nEach one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaric\nand cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terrorists\nare no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder that\nterrorism should have no hiding place and no\nopportunity to raise funds, and that there should be no\nlet-up in our determination to bring its perpetrators\njustice. This applies to the new phenomenon of stateless\nterrorism as much as to its more familiar forms.\nAs a start, it is surely vital that all countries sign up\nto the 11 international conventions to ensure that terrorists\nhave no safe haven. We have ourselves, again, in Britain,\njust passed new legislation to ensure we can tackle\nterrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But we\nmust go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only if\nwe all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome the\nrecent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund-\nraising for terrorism on an international basis. As\nChairman of the G-8, I again offer today to host a high-\nlevel conference in London this autumn to deny the\nterrorists this means of support. Effective new measures\non an agreed international basis could make a real\ndifference.\nI have covered many points in my speech to the\nAssembly, but my main point is really a very simple one.\nWe face multiple new challenges as we approach the new\ncentury. Our only hope, as we all know, of tackling these\nchallenges successfully is tackling them together. We\nneed effective international cooperation and modern\ninstitutions to deal with our political problems and our\neconomic problems. We need the United Nations system\npulling together as never before. We need to revitalize\nand modernize our international institutions to deal with\nthe crisis in the global economy. But, above all, we need\npolitical will and a sense of urgency. The problems of our\nmodern world are too pressing, their consequences too\nimmediate, their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitate\nor to look away any longer. We are being given a\nwarning to act, to give purpose and direction in resolving\nthese challenges we face together, or pay the price. And\nthe time to do it \u2014 to respond to that warning \u2014 is now."

        "file_text": "At the outset,\nMr. President, let me extend to you Sri Lanka\u2019s warmest\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election. We wish\nyou well and have no doubt that you will guide the work\nof this session with wisdom, skill and commitment.\nThe Assembly owes a debt of gratitude to His\nExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko for his wise and\nastute leadership as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session.\n22\n\n\nThis year Sri Lanka celebrates the golden jubilee of its\nindependence. We reclaimed our freedom in 1948, ending\nnearly five centuries of colonial domination. We have given\nshelter within our land to all the great religions of the\nworld: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. We are\na multiethnic and multicultural society. We are deeply\ncommitted to the democratic way of life. Our people have\nexercised universal adult franchise since 1931. We have a\nparliamentary system of government, with elections held\nregularly, where voter participation is uniquely high \u2014 as\nmuch as 80 per cent on average. We have an independent\njudiciary and free media. The rule of law is observed and\nrespected. Fundamental rights are guaranteed and rendered\njusticiable. We are constantly alert to the protection of\nhuman rights, even in the face of grave provocation from\nsome lawless elements that are bent on destroying our\ndemocratic society.\nShortly after the achievement of its independence, Sri\nLanka became a member of the United Nations. In the\npreamble to the Charter, the founding fathers expressed\ntheir determination to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war. They reaffirmed their faith in fundamental\nhuman rights. They pledged to establish an environment in\nwhich international law and treaty obligations would be\nobserved, and to promote the economic and social progress\nof all peoples. The United Nations has succeeded in\nkeeping its basic promise of saving the world from the\nholocaust of a global conflict.\nBut more than 50 years after the Charter was written,\nwe cannot conclude that the world today is a safer place\nthan it was when the United Nations was founded. Global\nnuclear disarmament remains a distant dream. Nuclear\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction have proliferated\nwith no concern for the safety of humankind despite the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Members of\nthe nuclear club that possess these weapons show no\ninclination to dismantle them even though the cold war has\nended and conflicts between States have lessened. The\nUnited Nations has the responsibility to redouble its efforts\nto achieve global disarmament. That is a duty we owe to\nmankind, to unborn generations. We do not accept the\nthesis that these weapons are safe in the hands of some.\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been\ndemanding for a long time that the Conference on\nDisarmament should establish, as its highest priority, a\ncommittee to commence negotiations on a programme for\nthe complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a time\nbound framework.\nIn 1976 my mother, Mrs. Sirimavo R. D.\nBandaranaike, addressing the Assembly as Prime Minister\nof Sri Lanka and chairperson of the Movement of Non-\nAligned Countries, spoke of disarmament in the following\nwords:\n\u201cGeneral and complete disarmament has been\na declared objective of the United Nations and of the\ninternational community for nearly three decades.\n\u201cDespite many initiatives taken by this\nOrganization ... the world has witnessed not even the\nsemblance of disarmament but a race for supremacy\nin destructive power, based on the myth that peace\ncan be preserved only by strident and single-minded\npreparations for war and the refinement and\nsophistication of its techniques. It is, indeed, a sad\nreflection on the moral and intellectual standards of\nthe twentieth century and of its values and priorities\nthat so much of the world\u2019s resources, which might\nhave been devoted to the eradication of poverty,\nignorance, disease and hunger, are being [wasted on]\nthe production of monstrous weapons ...\n\u201c[We] do not accept the thesis that\ndisarmament is the special preserve of Powers that\npossess the paraphernalia of war. Every nation and\nevery individual has a right to peace, and just as\npeace is indivisible so is the responsibility for its\npreservation. Hence the call of the non-aligned\nnations for a special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament and agreement for\na world conference.\u201d (A/31/PV.11, paras. 37-39)\nAt the recently concluded Non-Aligned Movement\nSummit, held in South Africa under the chairmanship of\nPresident Nelson Mandela, the Movement once again\nexpressed its preoccupation with the issue of global\nnuclear disarmament. In the years ahead the clamour for\ndisarmament among the great majority of nations will\ngrow in volume. The Non-Aligned Movement has\nconsistently called for the Geneva-based Conference on\nDisarmament to establish, as the highest priority, an ad\nhoc committee to commence negotiations on a programme\nfor the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a\ntime-bound framework. In addition, there is also a\nproposal for a nuclear weapons convention. We have to\naddress these challenges as we approach the new\nmillennium. The longer we shirk our responsibility, the\ngreater the danger that looms ahead.\n23\n\n\nToday I have the honour and privilege of addressing\nthe Assembly as the newly appointed chairperson of the\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\n(SAARC), which met in Colombo a few months ago.\nSAARC represents one fifth of humanity. South Asia is heir\nto a rich and complex plurality of cultural and religious\ntraditions of great antiquity.\nLike any other association of sovereign States, we\nhave our share of problems. But I wish to convey my\nconfident belief that our summit meetings last year and this\nyear have marked a turning point in the life of our\nassociation. Our leaders are aware of the awesome\nobligations that we jointly owe to the hundreds of millions\nof people who inhabit our region. We are determined to put\naside the political differences that bedevil relations among\nsome of us, in a common and united effort to improve the\nquality of life of our peoples.\nThe message I bring from the Colombo Summit is that\nthe prospects for enhanced economic, technological, social\nand scientific cooperation in our region are exceedingly\nbright. It is the will of our leaders, as vigorously manifested\nat the Colombo Summit. I am deeply indebted to my fellow\nHeads of State and Government for their invaluable advice\nand cooperation, and especially to the Prime Ministers of\nIndia and Pakistan for the magnificent spirit of friendship\nand understanding they showed for the collective regional\ninterests and concerns.\nSAARC too, like the Non-Aligned Movement,\nrecognizes that the twin currents of globalization and\nliberalization which are swirling around us contain both the\npotential for prosperity as well as the seed of a dangerous\nnew process of uneven development. It must be\nremembered that developing countries need special\nconsideration in regard to the problems they face in\nglobalizing their economies.\nHowever, what is abundantly clear is that not a single\nState, not even the most powerful, can hope to remain\nimmune from economic disease and contagion. Ripples\nhave spread widely from the economic upheavals of East\nAsia and Russia. The maladies that spring from economic\nglobalization require remedies which are global in scope,\nremedies which must take account of the ailments of all\nStates and not be based solely on the prescriptions\nadvanced by those who may seem to be secure.\nUnited Nations bodies must play a critical role in all\nthis, particularly by facilitating and fostering international\ncooperation for equitable development that could resist the\neconomic contagion that now afflicts us. The international\nmonetary mechanism has proved desperately inadequate\nin handling the recent crises. We now have to think in\nterms of a new financial architecture to obtain radical\nreforms of the international monetary system. This should\naim at achieving a balance between the adjustments\ndemanded as against available financing.\nI wish to propose three areas of action that merit\nserious consideration: first, that a \u201clender of last resort\u201d\nfacility must be formulated to meet the problems of\nvolatile capital movements; secondly, that effective\ninternational surveillance devices must be designed to\nanticipate problems before the demolition squads of\nspeculators move in; and thirdly, that the resumption of\nthe Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) be a vital requirement of the proposed\nrestructuring. The major voting Powers of the IMF, as\nwell as the developing nations, will have to consider\nlarger allocations than are now contemplated. In the\nmeantime, we should beware of attempts to liberalize\ncapital accounts before the modernization of national\nfinancial structures and the reforms of the international\nmonetary system are in place.\nA constructive dialogue between developed and\ndeveloping countries must be pursued on the basis of\nmutual benefit and shared responsibilities. Closer\nconsultation should be promoted between groups like the\nGroup of 7, the G-77 and the G-15.\nInstitutions such as the World Trade Organization\nmust live up to their declared aims and genuinely\nfacilitate a transparent, rule-based trading system that\nwould permit stable growth. The United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\nshould not be neglected. It should be strengthened as the\nfocal point in the United Nations family for the integrated\nconsideration of issues of trade, finance, technology and\ninvestment.\nMore funds for development activity need to be\ndiverted from the United Nations administrative budget.\nThe United Nations Agenda for Development, which was\nlaunched with great expectations, seems to be losing\nmomentum. Its implementation should not be delayed.\nDevelopment is not merely a matter of economic\ngrowth and financial enrichment, to be measured in\nstatistics, which can sometimes be misleading and\nillusory. The totality of the human condition must be\nenhanced and improved. Our commitment and\n24\n\n\nresponsibility towards economic and social development\nshould not be minimized and made secondary to other\nissues which, though important, do not touch on the well-\nbeing of humanity. It is a grievous indictment on us that the\nage-old problems of grinding poverty and starvation still\nexist in today\u2019s world. I appeal to the assembled nations not\nto allow ourselves to be beguiled or dazzled by the\nexplosion of exciting new technologies, the seductive\nblandishments of global trade and high finance to the extent\nthat the poor, the deprived, the desperate fall away from\nour agenda into the limbo of forgotten things. We must not\nforget that the least developed countries have special\nproblems that cry out for attention. We must strive\nmightily, relentlessly, to banish these problems in the next\ncentury.\nThe G-77 has proposed that a third world summit be\nheld in the year 2000 to mark the dawn of the new century.\nSri Lanka supports the proposal as an opportunity for\ndeveloping countries to chart their own agenda for\ndevelopment in the new era.\nThe countries of SAARC agreed at Colombo that to\ncomplement economic progress, a Social Charter should be\ndrawn up for the benefit of our peoples in South Asia. This\nwould focus on determining practical, basic norms in the\nareas of poverty eradication, the empowerment of women,\nthe mobilization of youth, the promotion of health and\nnutrition, and the protection of children.\nWe must make a special effort to dissipate the effects\nof the discriminatory, social and psychological perceptions\nthat affect the status of women. The SAARC heads of State\nor Government condemned violence against women as well\nas acts of discrimination and humiliation which further\ndepress the dignity of women. There was particular concern\nover the plight of women and girl children caught in\nsituations of armed conflict.\nIn Colombo, the SAARC States finalized the draft text\nof a regional convention on combating the crime of\ntrafficking in women and children for prostitution, which\nwill be signed at the next summit in Nepal. Within Sri\nLanka, my Government has adopted a national plan of\naction based on the relevant conclusions of the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, held in Beijing, and on the\nspecifics of our own national situation. The Constitution of\nSri Lanka enshrines the fundamental right of equality\nbetween the sexes. We have ratified International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) Conventions guaranteeing equal\nremuneration and other benefits to women. We have\nstrengthened legal provisions against harassment and\nsexual abuse of women.\nWith regard to children, my Government has\nrecently passed legislation to set up a National Child\nProtection Authority directly under my supervision. This\nAuthority deals with such issues as child employment, the\nsexual exploitation of children, education, health and the\nplight of children trapped in armed conflict. We have\nformulated a \u201cChildren\u2019s Charter\u201d and a National Plan of\nAction to provide for the safety and protection of our\nchildren. While we are conscious of the tragic incidence\nof child prostitution and pornography in our country, we\nhave also traced the insidious international linkages which\naggravate the problem further. We urge the international\ncommunity to tighten laws and enforcement mechanisms\nto ensure that those responsible for such heinous crimes\nwill not receive refuge anywhere.\nA particularly cruel offence against the innocence of\nchildren is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in\nSri Lanka to serve as suicide killers in the name of a\ncause they are too young even to comprehend.\nThis is just one sordid aspect of the activities of a\nterrorist group known as the Tamil Tigers \u2014 or the\nLTTE. They seek to dismember Sri Lanka, with the\nobjective of creating in our land a monoethnic and racist\nentity \u2014 an objective totally unacceptable to the\noverwhelming majority in the country and even to the\nvery community whose cause the LTTE claims to\nrepresent.\nWe believe that ethnic grievances exist in Sri Lanka.\nI said so in my address to the nation at the fiftieth\nanniversary celebrations of our independence this year. I\nsaid that the golden jubilee of independence was an\noccasion for reflection, as well as the renewal of hopes\nand aspirations. It was an occasion to savour applause for\nour achievements and also to rue the consequences of\nfailure. I said:\n\u201cWe must also with humility examine our failures.\nWe have failed in the essential task of nation-\nbuilding. We have meandered and faltered along that\npath, whilst among our neighbours in Asia and in\nmany other countries, peoples of various racial,\nreligious and linguistic communities live in\nharmony. The causes of this failure will be judged\nby history. Others will apportion and assign blame.\n25\n\n\n\u201cLet us, those of us who have undertaken the\nresponsibility to guide and govern the Nation, march\ntowards the future in unison, putting behind us mean\ndesires for petty personal or political gain. The\nNation\u2019s need today is so great and urgent that it\npermits space only for largesse of heart and mind,\nwhich will supersede in the national interest all that is\nirrelevant and small.\u201d\nMy Government is firmly committed to redressing\nethnic grievances peacefully through political discussion.\nWe have presented a comprehensive proposal for\naddressing the ethnic grievances through a wide devolution\nof political power. The vast majority of our people, of all\ncommunities, have welcomed these proposals. Only the\nLTTE chooses to prowl the path of violence, resorting to\nterror to achieve goals which it alone espouses. However,\nwe have kept the doors open to the LTTE to join other Sri\nLankans in negotiating a settlement of all outstanding ethnic\nissues if it eschews terrorism and its bloody call for a\nseparate State.\nThe LTTE claims to be a \u201cliberation organization\u201d\nwhile it murders hundreds upon hundreds of the Tamil\npeople it claims to liberate when they disagree with the\nLTTE\u2019s terror politics. Several Tamil leaders of democratic\npolitical parties, including members of parliament and two\nmayors, as well as Tamil human rights activists, have been\nbrutally murdered by the LTTE. Its claim to be a\n\u201cliberation organization\u201d is negated by its unilateral resort\nto violence and its constant refusal to put its claims to the\ntrue test \u2014 that of participating in an open, democratic,\npeaceful process of consultation with the people.\nBy contrast, in Palestine, Chairman Arafat pursues\nwhat he calls \u201cthe peace of the brave\u201d, confident not only\nof the justice of his cause, but also of the strength of\nsupport freely given by the Palestinian people to achieve\ntheir inalienable right in Palestine. During the SAARC\nsummit, we expressed growing concern at numerous\nsetbacks affecting the peace process in the Middle East,\nincluding illegal attempts to change the jurisdiction and the\nborders of Jerusalem.\nOver the past few years the Government of Sri Lanka\nhas in various international forums strongly advocated the\nneed for collective international action in order to overcome\nthe scourge of terrorism. Our reasoning has been that a\ngroup like the ruthless LTTE, which continues to frustrate\nevery effort at finding a negotiated political settlement to\nour ethnic problem, has found sustenance in the liberal\nasylum policies that prevail in some countries. This group,\nwhich recruits children as young as 10 years,\nindiscriminately targets innocent civilians, assassinates the\nelected representatives of the people, including Tamil\npolitical and human rights leaders, destroys places of\nreligious worship and assassinates foreign heads of\nGovernment on their soil, is permitted to operate freely in\nmany countries. It maintains an international network\nwhich engages in fund-raising, narcotics trafficking, trade\nin illicit arms, the smuggling of illegal immigrants and, in\nmore recent times, maritime and cyber-terrorism.\nAddressing the United Nations fiftieth anniversary\ncelebrations in New York three years ago, I observed:\n\u201cConcerted international action is essential to combat\nterrorism and to compel the terrorists to renounce\nviolence and enter the democratic process.\nUnfortunately, effective action to that end has been\nfrustrated through sterile philosophical debate about\nthe nature of terrorism.\u201d (A/50/PV.35, p. 9)\nI am happy to note that since then significant\nmeasures have been taken. The adoption of the United\nNations International Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings earlier this year has been a\nconsiderable moral victory for the international\ncommunity in its fight against terrorism. Sri Lanka is\nhopeful that all States will speedily take steps to\nimplement the necessary domestic legislation, aimed at\ngiving effect to the commitments made in the Convention,\nto ensure that terrorists are neither provided safe haven\nnor permitted to raise funds within the borders of one\nState to sustain terrorist activities in another State.\nWhile we enact legislation, we must also be eternally\nvigilant to ensure that terrorists do not find loopholes in\nour laws to circumvent the emerging international\nconsensus against terrorism. We are particularly conscious\nof the capacity of terrorist groups to resort to the strategy\nof using front organizations for raising funds which end\nup in the LTTE war chest to contribute towards\nmurdering and brutalizing our people. Moral and legal\nsanctions against terrorists are not enough. Laws must be\neffectively implemented. Only by such concerted action\nshall we be able to ensure that terrorists are compelled to\nrenounce violence and enter the democratic process.\nHere I would like to thank India and the United\nStates of America, in particular, for having recognized\nand declared the LTTE to be the terrorist organization\nthat it is, as well as for encouraging my Government to\nsettle this problem by political means. I would like to add\n26\n\n\nhere that this is an internal problem that Sri Lanka is fully\nable and ready to resolve, with the full support of its\npeoples. We will not tolerate any outside interference, while\nwe appreciate all the support given us by our friends abroad\nin resolving this conflict.\nIf at this stage I mention Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi of\nMyanmar it is because I am personally aware of the\nloneliness, the anguish, the difficulties and dangers that a\nwoman leader faces in political life. The people of Sri\nLanka and the people of Myanmar and their Governments\nhave been friends over many centuries. Our peoples share\nan invaluable heritage \u2014 the timeless message of the\nBuddha, the enlightened one who taught the world the\nmeaning of compassion, tolerance and understanding. This\nmessage moves me to express the hope that political issues\nin Myanmar may be approached in a spirit of conciliation\nand tolerance.\nIn all this, a catalytic role can and must be played by\nthe United Nations system. The United Nations has passed\nits half-century mark. The Secretary-General has described\nthe United Nations as \u201ca noble experiment in human\ncooperation\u201d. Last year was designated the year of United\nNations reform, and we are happy that a major portion of\nthe reforms introduced have been implemented. Some\nothers require further study.\nWe are aware of the financial crisis the United Nations\nis facing due to the default of certain Member States in\npaying their contributions. We urge them to pay their dues\nfully, without conditions and on time.\nWe are disappointed that agreement has not been\nreached over the reconstitution of the Security Council to\nreflect better the generality of United Nations membership.\nThe Council should be more representative, and its\ndeliberations more transparent and democratic, thus\nresponding to the concerns of all and shedding its image,\nnot entirely inaccurate, of largely serving the interests of\nthe major Powers.\nIn the closing years of the present millennium, the\nworld is a far more complex place than it was when the\nUnited Nations Charter was adopted. The range and\nramifications of the issues with which the Organization\nmust contend have dramatically increased. Change in the\norientation of the United Nations must keep pace with new\nrealities. The Secretary-General\u2019s Programme for Reform\nis a step in the right direction. Yet nothing will contribute\nmore to the success of the United Nations than the extent\nof Member States\u2019 commitment to the Organization\u2019s\ndecisions. The credibility and strength of those decisions\nwill itself depend on the transparency of the decision-\nmaking process and on how closely Member States\nidentify with those decisions. If the United Nations is to\ncontinue on its voyage into the twenty-first century with\nrenewed vigour, to achieve its objectives of peace,\nsecurity, economic development and social reform, all its\nMembers must be empowered to participate meaningfully\nand at every level of the decision-making process.\nTo this end, two important reforms must be placed\non our agenda. First, the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil so that it will more fully represent two thirds of\nthe world populace is an indispensable requirement. The\ndeveloping nations and the regions of the world in which\nthey predominate must have permanent representation on\nthe Security Council.\nSecondly, the crucial role of the General Assembly\nin the decision-making process of the United Nations\nmust be recognized and guaranteed. The United Nations\nGeneral Assembly is the supreme parliament of mankind.\nToday the era of the cold war is over. Economic\nglobalization is breaking down national boundaries to an\nextent that would have been unimaginable a few decades\nago. The world is truly on the threshold of a new order\nwhich surely cannot be driven any more by the narrow\nnational concerns that have paralysed the imagination of\nmankind for so long. Never before in human history have\nwe been presented with the stupendous possibilities that\nsurround us today of breaking the mundane bonds that\nbind us to banality and triviality. When the unconquered,\nunconquerable spirit of mankind is allowed to soar to its\nfull potential we will achieve a world in which truth and\njustice prevail, a world which we can proudly bequeath to\nthe unborn generations of our peoples.\nPrime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, my late\nfather, addressing this Assembly at its eleventh session, in\n1956, spoke as follows:\n\u201cIn an Organization such as this, the service that a\ncountry can render ... is not to be measured alone by\nthe size of that country, its population, its power or\nits strength. This is an Organization which expresses\nitself most effectively by bringing to bear a certain\nmoral force \u2014 the collective moral force and\ndecency of human beings. That is a task in which\nthe weak as well as the strong can render a useful\nservice, and I give the Assembly the assurance, on\nbehalf of my country, that as far as we are\n27\n\n\nconcerned, every endeavour that we can make in all\nsincerity to assist in the achievements of those noble\nideals for which this Organization stands will always\nbe forthcoming in the fullest measure.\u201d (A/PV.590,\npara. 42)\nAddressing this Assembly 42 years later, I make bold\nto say that Sri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicated\nMember of this Organization. We have made a contribution\nto the quality of its deliberations and to the implementation\nof its programmes. We are deeply committed to the\nprinciples of the Charter. We believe in the United Nations.\nWe want it to be a strong, principled and effective body,\nthe common inheritance of all mankind, not the preserve of\na few wealthy and powerful States, but the guardian of all,\nespecially the poor, the weak and the defenceless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to congratulate\nthe President and wish him every success in carrying out\nhis responsible task. The delegation of Poland will do its\nbest to assist him in his important functions.\nI also pay tribute to the outgoing President,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, an eminent statesman from\nUkraine, a country with which we have developed good-\nneighbourly ties of friendship and cooperation, for his\nexcellent guidance of the work of the Assembly during its\nfifty-second session.\nI would also like to assure the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, not only of our respect and admiration,\nbut also of our continued support for his tireless efforts to\nmake the United Nations live up to the expectations of\nthe twenty-first century and to the ideals set out in the\nCharter.\nWe have a saying in Poland that is variously\nattributed to the Chinese or to the Jews \u2014 two nations\nwell steeped in suffering and in wisdom:\n\u201cUnfortunate one, you shall live to see your dreams\nsatisfied.\u201d\nAnd I, indeed, have come to experience the full measure\nof that truth. Ten years ago a dissident, I could barely\neven dream that I would be at the helm of my free\nnation?s foreign affairs, and in that role preside over the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), an organization which spans three continents in\nits attempt to promote security and cooperation in a\nconflict-torn world.\nAnd yet those 10 years ago, had I imagined that\nsuch a future were possible I would probably have\nbelieved that a man in my position could indeed help\nchange the world, make it a better, safer place. Like so\nmany of us present here in this Hall, I had to learn the\nbitter lessons of the limitations of power. These lessons\nshould indeed teach us humility, but not serve as an alibi\nfor not assuming our obligations.\nThe world today is a better and safer place than it\nwas 10 years ago, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. For\nall the needless suffering, the agony of hunger, the\nscourge of ethnic hatred and war, the shame of\nunderdevelopment, the evil of oppression that human\nbeings had to endure in so many places on the face of the\nplanet \u2014 these are less than a decade ago. And even now\nthe perpetrators attempt to conceal their doings, to show\nit is not so, and more, that suffering is contentment, war\nis peace, and oppression is liberty. Hypocrisy, as we all\nknow, is a compliment sin pays to virtue.\nThe world is a better place because time and time\nagain evil has been avoided, circumscribed or reduced\nthanks to preventive action taken by concerned States.\nThis action could be something as simple as sending food\n20\n\n\nwhere there is none, or as complicated as over a dozen\nnations pooling their military resources to prevent a new\noutbreak of ethnic hatred in Bosnia, and helping to rebuild\nthat devastated nation.\nThe world will never be the same. The world economy\nis currently confronted with the biggest financial challenge\nin a half century. We note the increasing interest on the\npart of politicians as well as economists in market\nintervention and capital controls. Obviously, a serious\nsituation may indeed call for desperate remedies, but the\nreally serious risk to the world economy seems to lie in a\nretreat from free market ideals and principles.\nActions to limit the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction are an evident reflection of efforts made to\nconsolidate peace and international security. Systematic\nprogress in the field of nuclear disarmament, apart from\nimportant American-Russian and American-Chinese\nagreements, could become even more notable if the\nParliament of the Russian Federation, heeding the appeals\nby the international community, ratified the START II\nagreements. We expect and hope that the indispensable\ndecision will be taken in Moscow with no further delay.\nWe welcome the decision of the Geneva Conference\non Disarmament to enter negotiations on a treaty banning\nthe production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and\nother nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.\nThis is a significant and indispensable step for the further\nconsolidation of the global regime of non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons.\nAt the same time, we witness with concern and regret\nthe developments in South Asia that are so dangerous to\npeace and international security. Although we do not\nquestion the right of any nation to sovereign decisions on\nissues concerning its national security interests, nothing, in\nour opinion, justifies acceptance of the nuclear option. The\nchoice of the road of nuclear armaments by India and\nPakistan comes as a blow to the ideals personified by\nMahatma Gandhi.\nTogether with the entire international community, we\naddress to the leaders of India and Pakistan an appeal to\nrefrain from any actions that could make the situation\nworse in the Indian subcontinent and to join, immediately\nand unconditionally, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT).\nThe sixteenth-century Polish humanist Jakub Przyluski\nwrote:\n\u201cSince man is ... more inclined to live in society\nthan bees, ants or cranes, an isolated life is a thing\nmost contrary to human nature. Man could then\nneither suffice to himself, nor come to the rescue of\nothers... And since nature has established some kind\nof affinity between us, and the same definition\nencompasses all humankind, we are to consider it\nvile if man threatens man.\u201d\nWe, indeed, consider it vile if man threatens man.\nBut it is in our nature, or at least in our better nature, to\ncome to the rescue of others, the more so if by making\nothers more secure, our own security is enhanced.\nFurthermore, neighbours usually know best the nature of\nthe problems affecting the neighbourhood; they are\ntherefore best placed to try to resolve them. That is why\nthe concept of collective security is becoming so\nincreasingly important and popular. But we must all learn\nthis if this Organization is to successfully negotiate the\ntransition into the twenty-first century. The United\nNations has grown beyond the hopes and expectations \u2014\nindeed, beyond control.\nMany of its specialized agencies accomplish their\nimportant jobs quietly and efficiently. We have perfect\nrelations with many of them, especially with the United\nNations Development Programme office in Warsaw.\nThe Secretary-General is to be praised for his efforts\nto make the United Nations a better example of how the\nworld?s institutions could function, rather than a cartoon\nof the way they actually do. But he can do this only with\nour support. Also, we can no longer delay the reform of\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. I am sure\nall of us look towards these changes with some dread,\nbecause knowing how wrong things could have turned\nout, we cannot believe that they have been going right\nuntil now. The United Nations is ripe for change.\nOne of the most pressing issues on the United\nNations reform agenda is the financial crisis. It is true this\ncrisis is due in great part to the mismanagement of\nresources and, at times, excessive spending. But at least\nas much can be attributed to the deficit brought about by\nsome Members? refusal to pay their dues on time. True,\nit is in large part because that pressure that a favourable\nclimate for change emerged within the institution itself.\nIt has become a truism to say that peacekeeping is\nineffective when there is no peace to keep, and that\npeacemaking is impossible if there is no will to sustain\nthe unavoidable costs. But this does not mean that\n21\n\n\npeacekeeping is ineffective. A wide spectrum of examples,\nfrom Cyprus to Moldova, shows that the contrary is true.\nBut even in a successful peacekeeping operation we run the\nrisk that we will not only keep the peace but also preserve\nthe hatreds, envies and jealousies which were the root\ncauses of the conflict in the first place. In this sense, each\npeacekeeping operation must also be one of peacemaking.\nArmed conflicts between States are giving way to\ninternal conflicts, as in Rwanda and in the former\nYugoslavia. Consequently, the United Nations peacekeeping\nforces are being faced, in many cases, with the dilemma of\nhaving to depart from the principle of non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of the State that is being torn apart by\na civil war. We remain convinced that when a direct threat\nis posed to peace and security, the United Nations must be\nproperly equipped to discharge its role and should not\nremain indifferent and ignore human suffering.\nPoland is proud of its continuous participation in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts, following our old\ntradition of struggle \u201cfor freedom, ours and yours\u201d. We are\ncurrently providing the largest contingent of troops involved\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are\nconvinced that the Organization should not allow the\nhighest price to be paid in terms of the lives of women and\nmen serving in the field under the United Nations banner.\nThe security of people in United Nations peacekeeping and\nhumanitarian operations must be ensured.\nMy country finds itself at the centre of European\ntransformation. Our aspirations to join European and trans-\nAtlantic political and military structures are in the process\nof being satisfied, fulfilling the dreams of a nation long\nsubject to the cataclysms of European history. But far from\nturning our back on our neighbours who as yet remain\noutside these structures, we indeed wish to intensify our\ncooperation with them. We believe this would be conducive\nto a better climate on the continent, and in the best interests\nof both our neighbours and our allies.\nThis is especially true of our cooperation with other\nCentral European nations. Poland, solidly anchored in\ncollective security and regional cooperation structures, can\ndevelop in peace and security and substantially contribute\nto the development of others. If there ever was a win-win\nscenario, this is it.\nIt would be arrogant and unhelpful if we believed we\ncould give lessons to others. But we do believe deeply that\nour experience of the last decade shows that nations can\nmove away from authoritarianism, through negotiations \u2014\nwhat we called round-table negotiations \u2014 to then\nsuccessfully build a democratic system based on the rule\nof law, individual freedoms, freedom of economic\nenterprise and political democracy. To those, near or far,\nwho proclaim that theirs will be a different course, based\non the presumed specificity of their culture, history,\ncustoms and circumstance, we say, \u201cPlease reconsider. Do\nnot waste the creative energy of your nations in futile\nexperiments and grotesque performances.\u201d This will not\nwork. And time is a resource none can afford to waste.\nBut at the same time, to those who would say,\n\u201cFollow us, for history has proved that we are right\u201d, \u2014\nwe would like to say that even among friends we can\ndiffer. We do not believe too much in the efficacy of\npunishment and sanction. Rather, we expect that nations\nneed to develop apace. We can but help them on their\nway.\nThis is best seen in the functioning of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), which my country has the honour of chairing\nthis year. It would be hard to imagine a collection of\nnations more geographically, historically, economically,\nculturally and politically diverse. Assuming the\nchairmanship of this organization for 1998, we have faced\nimportant questions and challenges. Can the organization\nthat is the heritage of the past successfully cope with the\nchallenges of the future? Is it needed during a period of\nboth globalization and regionalization, a period of multi-\npolarity, when we are striving for the universalization of\nthe Earth?s civilization? Will it be able to prevent\nconflicts and regulate inter-State relations?\nThe Polish chairmanship started at the moment of\nsignificant changes in the so-called European security\nenvironment: when the Atlantic Alliance decided on its\nenlargement; when a conflict erupted in Kosovo,\nthreatening South-Eastern Europe with destabilization;\nwhen the countries of Central Asia, born from the\nterritory of the former Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics, signalled their more intensive interest in\njoining the current of values that are the foundation of the\nOSCE; and when signs of another crisis appeared in\nRussia. There arose the question of how to include OSCE\nactivity in United Nations efforts for peace and security.\nWe have found constructive and positive answers to\nmany of those questions. The organization of an all-\ninclusive membership of the States of the region, from\nVancouver to Vladivostok, turned out to be necessary to\nrespond to threats left by the cold war. Two priorities\n22\n\n\ncame to the fore: to prevent conflicts by reaching the roots\nat their early stage of appearance and to strengthen human\nrights and democracy, which the OSCE calls the \u201chuman\ndimension\u201d. We have also taken up the ambitious challenge\nof preparing a European security charter, which would help\nto facilitate the functioning of cooperation in security within\nthe OSCE, and would make it possible for all States,\nregardless of their membership in alliances or other\ngroupings, to participate in the common effort of building\na safe, democratic and united Europe.\nWe want the OSCE community to have neither centre\nnor peripheries, neither more equal nor less equal. In many\ncases, as in the conflicts in Kosovo or Tajikistan, the lesson\nwas bitter. One of the conclusions is that in the\ncontemporary world, no organization can act alone. The\nconsolidation of standards of civilizational cooperation\nwithin the OSCE must be coherent with the activity of\nother organizations, in this case the United Nations, the\nEuropean Union, the North Atlantic Alliance, the Council\nof Europe and subregional organizations such as the\nCouncil of the Baltic States.\nWe need this solidarity. There I wish to comment on\nthe resolution adopted by the Security Council yesterday\nconcerning Kosovo. It was an example of unity and\nsolidarity, and I hope it will send a message to stop the\nbloodshed in that region and stop the activities of all those\nwho are trying to introduce violence, repression and\nterrorism there.\nThe OSCE has been able to engage in preventive\ndiplomacy. We have done so together; we have\nstrengthened our collective security together; we have\nfielded a host of projects in almost every imaginable sphere\nof human collective activity. In all fairness, one has to take\ninto consideration the conflicts avoided elsewhere in the\nBalkans, as well as in Central Asia and in the Caucasus.\nWe do not proclaim to be a model for others. The\norganization itself developed almost by chance, as a\nfortuitous assembly of the members of the two cold-war\nblocs. But we have been able to manage the transition and\nto set standards that we all try to maintain. Maybe other\nregions of conflicting interests could use some of our\nexperience, both the successes and the mistakes.\nIn the Middle East, we are facing a challenging and\ndifficult time. Poland is committed to a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace in that region. Therefore, we are\ndeeply concerned by the stalemate in the peace process, and\nwe strongly support all efforts to revitalize it, on the basis\nof Security Council resolutions, the principles of the\nMadrid Conference and the Oslo accords.\nIn many aspects the world is now a safer and better\nplace to live in than it was a decade ago. But there are\nnew threats and dangers. We must deter and defeat\nterrorist acts. Poland continues to promote the idea of the\nelaboration of the comprehensive convention against\norganized crime, which should generate wide and efficient\ncooperation between States, since organized transnational\ncrime cannot be successfully suppressed by any State\nalone.\nBorderlines are blurred. Ordinary crime blends with\nthe organized underworld, which in turn intermingles with\nthe terrorist community, and that in turn finds support and\nrelief in more than one of the world?s capitals. Drugs and\nguns are replacing more conventional currencies as the\nuniversal currency of evil, profits from one serving to\npromote the dissemination of the other, in a concerted\nassault on human life itself. It is indeed a culture of death\nwhich seems to unite those who put guns and drugs into\nthe hands of the young and teach them to hate others\nbecause they are of the wrong faith, race or nation. We\ncannot counter that evil with the same decisiveness, haste\nand cunning. We can, however, continue to support the\nalternative: a culture of life, founded on respect for the\nindividual, his inalienable rights, dignity and freedom. In\nterms of everyday reality, this means that the determined\neffort of all States is required to implement the basic\nconventions guaranteeing these values \u2014 to implement\nthem at home and to refuse to tolerate their violations\nabroad.\nOf these conventions, perhaps none is more\nimportant than the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, whose fiftieth anniversary we have been solemnly\ncelebrating. And yet, among States whose representatives\nhave expressed their attachment to that document, not a\nfew deny their citizens the basic rights the Declaration\nguarantees. Obviously, the powerful political interests\nwhich lie behind such behaviour will not bow to simple\ndeclarations, nor will the international democratic\ncommunity use force to implement its values.\nIt is our deep conviction that we should continuously\nadapt United Nations human rights machinery to present\nand future developments in this area. The biggest\nchallenge we have been facing over recent years is the\nviolation of human rights in the context of armed\nconflicts and tensions of a domestic or civil character. For\nyears the international community has not been able to\n23\n\n\ncope with this problem, although in the meantime the\nUnited Nations has developed a significant peacekeeping\ncapacity. It is only after the traumatic experience in the\nformer Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region that the\napproach has changed.\n\u201cNo man is an island\u201d; no State is an island.\nConnected, as the Polish writer whom I quoted said, by a\ncommon definition of our humanity, we cannot help but try\nto implement the noblest goal, incarnate in the name of this\nOrganization: the Nations United, in our common humanity,\nour planet and our future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea,\nto congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Uruguay, on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. We believe that his\nrich experience and diplomatic skill in dealing with\ninternational affairs will lead this session to fruitful results.\nWe also express our gratitude to the former President,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his successful stewardship of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. At the\nsame time, I wish to take this opportunity to express our\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his efforts\ndevoted to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nIt is the wish and aspiration of humankind to make the\nforthcoming twenty-first century peaceful and prosperous.\nIn this connection, we believe that working out appropriate\nways and means to achieve that end should be the main\nfocus of the current session.\nThe next century should be one of independence. In\norder to build a world free of all forms of domination and\nsubordination and to ensure equality among all countries\nand nations, independence should be realized throughout the\nworld. Only when all Member States adhere to the Juche\ncharacter and the national character and firmly maintain\nindependence in all fields of State activities can\ninternational peace and security also be ensured.\nAt the first session of the tenth Supreme People\u2019s\nAssembly of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea,\nheld on 5 September this year, our people unanimously reelected with high esteem the Great Leader Comrade Kim\nJong Il as Chairman of the National Defence Committee.\nThe chairmanship of the National Defence Committee is the\nhighest post of the State, organizing and leading the work\nof defending the country and the destiny of the people, as\nwell as strengthening and increasing the defence capabilities\nof the country and State power as a whole through\ncommand over all its political, military and economic\nforces. It is a sacred and important post that symbolizes\nand represents the honour of the country and the dignity\nof the nation.\nThe election of our Great Leader General Kim Jong\nIl as Chairman of the National Defence Committee is the\nmost significant event in the sacred cause of strengthening\nand developing our Republic and in achieving prosperity\nand happiness for all generations to come. It is a vivid\nexpression of our people\u2019s absolute trust in, support for\nand boundless loyalty to their leader.\nSome time ago, our people enthusiastically\ncelebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. What pleased\nour people most at this emotional juncture was the fact\nthat our scientists and technicians successfully launched\ninto orbit an artificial satellite, Kwangmyongsong No. 1,\nusing a multi-stage rocket carrier developed by us in our\nown way, with our own knowledge and 100 per cent our\nown technology. It was the first of its kind in the country.\nThe successful launching of our first artificial satellite\nwas an historic event demonstrating the might of our\nscientific and technical development, and it will make a\ngreat contribution to safeguarding world peace and\nenriching the store of science and technology for\nhumankind.\nIn the last 50 years, the Government of our Republic\nhas been able to safeguard the sovereignty of our country,\nadvance the socialism chosen by our people towards\nvictory and defend peace on the Korean peninsula by\nholding fast to the Juche character and the national\ncharacter, while firmly maintaining independence in all\nfields of State activities.\nThroughout the country our entire population is now\nfully determined to glorify our socialism, which is centred\non the popular masses, under the banner of the Republic\nfounded by our Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, the\nfounding father of socialist Korea. The people uphold the\nleadership of the respected and beloved General Kim Jong\nIl. In the near future, the world will see the independent\nand peace-loving Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\ndevelop into a prosperous Power.\nThe reunification of Korea and peace and security on\nthe Korean peninsula have long been a main area of\nconcern for the international community. From the\nviewpoint of both the misfortune and suffering of a nation\n31\n\n\nand the peace and security of a region, the division of the\nKorean peninsula should not last any longer. Due to the\nfact that Korea has not yet been reunified, military\nconfrontation and tensions grow increasingly aggravated\nbetween the United States, Japan and South Korea, on the\none hand, and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\non the other.\nAs a result of the present military manoeuvres against\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea on and around\nthe Korean peninsula, there is a growing danger that either\nthe twentieth century may close or the twenty-first century\nmay open with another Korean war. This danger should be\nremoved by all possible means. In order to remove the\ndanger of war and ensure a durable peace on the Korean\npeninsula, the reunification of the country should be\nachieved without fail.\nIndependence, peaceful reunification and great national\nunity are the three principles of national reunification\nagreed upon between the North and the South. These\nprinciples were also welcomed and supported by the United\nNations. The Government of our Republic consistently\nmaintains that Korea should be reunified by means of\nconfederacy on the basis of the three principles of\nreunification. In April this year, our Great Leader, Comrade\nKim Jong Il, advanced the five-point policy for the great\nunity of the entire nation as part of his continued efforts for\nnational reunification.\nThe main elements of the five-point policy are the\nprinciple of national independence; a change in policy by\nthe South Korean authorities towards reconciliation and\nalliance with the North; dialogue for the unity and\nreunification of the whole nation; the promotion of\ncoexistence, co-prosperity and public interests between the\nNorth and the South; and solidarity and coalition between\nthe North, South and the international community. The\nGovernment of our Republic will spare no effort to achieve\nthese points.\nWe have been consistently in favour of dialogue for\nreunification and to improve relations between the North\nand South of Korea. The North-South dialogue should be\nconducted on the basis of the principles of placing the\ncommon interests of the nation above all, removing distrust\nand confrontation between the North and the South and\nsubordinating everything to the cause of national\nreunification. No one should be allowed to use dialogue for\ndishonest political purposes or to perpetuate the division of\nthe country. If the South Korean authorities show their\nsincere desire for reunification by taking practical\nactions \u2014 such as abolishing the National Security Law\nand the like \u2014 we will meet with them at any time and\nhold dialogues and consultations to discuss the common\ndestiny of the nation and work together for national\nreunification.\nIn order for the Korean people to resolve the\nquestions of national unity and reunification by\nthemselves, concerned countries, including the United\nStates and Japan, should refrain from hindering the efforts\nof the Korean people. The United States Army is the\nmain military entity in South Korea and has long been in\nbelligerent relations with us. This is a quite abnormal\nphenomenon in today\u2019s post-cold-war international\nrelations and the product of anachronistic thinking. It is\nthe United States military entity and no other that\nconstitutes the major obstacle in the way of the\nindependent and peaceful reunification of Korea. In this\nforum, we once again strongly urge the United States to\nwithdraw its forces from South Korea and to end its\nbelligerent relations with us. The States Members of the\nUnited Nations should no longer claim to be unaware that\nthe name and flag of the United Nations continue to be\nabused to conceal these belligerent relations.\nWe are convinced that the most appropriate way of\nmaintaining peace on the Korean peninsula is to dissolve\nthe United Nations command in South Korea and to\nconclude a peace agreement between the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States. This is\nour unchanging position.\nJapan should not hinder the cause of our\nreunification by aggravating the tense situation on the\nKorean peninsula. Japan must discharge its responsibility\nfor the Korean question by sincerely apologizing and\nproviding compensation for its enormous crimes against\nour people, instead of attempting to declare war against\nus by drawing up so-called \u201cemergency legislation\u201d,\naimed at keeping pace militarily with the United States,\nthe belligerent party with us.\nRecently, too, the Japanese authorities behaved\nunreasonably when they publicly questioned our satellite\nlaunch and acted rashly in taking the issue to the Security\nCouncil, insisting that it respond to our launch. This was\na flagrant mockery of the international community. If our\nsatellite launch is a serious security concern, Japan\u2019s\nsatellite launches should be top priority for the Security\nCouncil\u2019s consideration.\n32\n\n\nWith just one year to go before the twenty-first\ncentury, the United Nations is faced with the task of\nbuilding a new world free from all forms of domination and\nsubordination. New challenges in safeguarding world peace\nand security, achieving the denuclearization of the world\nand ensuring social progress and economic development\nrequire the United Nations to find appropriate new\nmeasures.\nAlmost all the recent attempts by a few big countries,\nas opposed to the United Nations membership as a whole,\nto deal with international matters have met with failure.\nThis proves that the era of power politics and big-Power\narbitrary action ended with the cold war. The United\nNations is now at a crossroads. It can either be dictated to\nby big countries or become the Organization of a new era\nin which the purposes and principles of its Charter are\nsafeguarded and fully realized. The reform of the United\nNations should correctly reflect this reality.\nAt present, the most undemocratic organ in the United\nNations system is the Security Council. The current\ncomposition of the Council does not represent the general\nUnited Nations membership and the veto power of its\npermanent members often subverts the wishes of the\nmajority of member States.\nIf the United Nations is to be democratized, the\nSecurity Council should be reformed. To this end, the\nexpansion of the non-permanent category should be given\nprecedence, thus correcting, to a certain extent, the current\nimbalance in the Council\u2019s composition. Its working\nmethods must be improved for the sake of transparency.\nPriority should be given to the developing countries in the\nexpansion of the Council\u2019s permanent membership. Any\nState that has failed to atone for its past is not eligible for\npermanent membership. As for relations between the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, the authority\nof the General Assembly should be enhanced decisively.\nRecent events in southern Asia, witnessed by the\nentire world, remind us all that disarmament, especially\nnuclear disarmament, should remain a priority on the\nagenda of the United Nations. Although several years have\nelapsed since the end of the cold war, nuclear stockpiles\naround the world have become more sophisticated rather\nthan being reduced. When the international community\ncalled for a ban on all nuclear explosive tests, the nuclearweapon States opted for subcritical tests.\nThe proliferation of nuclear weapons cannot be\nprevented so long as the nuclear-weapon States pursue a\nmonopoly of nuclear weapons. The policy of the nuclearweapon States to provide a nuclear umbrella and their\ndouble standards in dealing with nuclear issues are among\nthe obstacles to making nuclear disarmament a reality.\nThe United Nations should decisively strengthen its\nrole in the field of disarmament. In this regard, we\nbelieve that there is a growing need to convene a fourth\nspecial session of the General Assembly on disarmament.\nThe issue of human rights needs to be dealt with\nobjectively and impartially within the framework of the\nUnited Nations. In today\u2019s international relations, the\nhuman rights issue has became synonymous with\nintervention in the internal affairs of other countries.\nAttempts to impose the values of one nation upon others\nare rampant. Consequently, the rights of people to choose\nand the sovereign rights of nations are being infringed.\nThe United Nations should reject the politicization of\nhuman rights and never tolerate double standards in the\nimplementation of human rights instruments.\nThe twenty-first century should be devoted to\ndevelopment and cooperation. Economic development and\nthe sustained growth of the developing countries should\nbecome a main theme in international economic relations.\nTo this end, the current inequitable international economic\nrelations need to be redressed and the external debt issue\nresolved.\nEconomic sanctions run counter to the ideal of\ncooperation, are anachronistic, and only incite\nconfrontation among nations. Countries that see economic\nsanctions as an instrument of power and authority should\npay due attention to the fact that many people, at home\nand abroad, are increasingly sceptical about and opposed\nto them.\nGlobalization has caused the monetary crisis in Asia,\nincreasing the poverty and marginalization of the\ndeveloping countries. The United Nations should find\nways to meet this new challenge. It should play its\nrightful role in strongly promoting the spirit of collective\nself-reliance of the developing countries and urging the\nimplementation of official development assistance by the\ndeveloped countries.\nThe delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea appreciates the efforts of the countries of Asia,\nAfrica and Latin America to develop regional and\nsubregional cooperation in the spirit of collective selfreliance. We also support Syria and other Arab countries\n33\n\n\nin their just struggle to seek a fair and comprehensive\nsolution to the Middle East problem and appreciate the\nefforts of the countries of Africa to promote peace, security\nand development there.\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the\nGovernments, organizations and individuals of various\ncountries, as well as the United Nations and governmental\nand non-governmental international organizations, for their\nhumanitarian assistance with the damage caused by several\nconsecutive years of natural disaster in my country.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is an\nindependent peace-loving State and its Government\nconsistently adheres to the fundamental ideal of\nindependence, peace and friendship in its foreign policy.\nThe Government of our Republic will develop relations of\nfriendship and cooperation with all countries respecting its\nsovereignty and continue to make every effort to ensure\npeace on the Korean peninsula and to safeguard peace and\nsecurity in North-East Asia, in conformity with the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\nMy delegation will contribute to the best of its ability\nto the successful deliberation of all items on the agenda of\nthe current session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased, on behalf of\nmy delegation, to extend to Mr. Opertti our warmest\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session.\nJust three months ago, the Philippines commemorated\nthe centennial of the birth of Asia\u2019s first Republic. A month\nbefore that the Filipino people conducted the most sacred\nrite of a democracy: the election of national leaders by\npopular will. The successful electoral process resulted in the\nsecond peaceful transfer of power since our \u201cpeople power\u201d\nrevolution of 1986. President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, with\na resounding mandate from the Filipino people, has taken\nover the task of leading the Philippines into its second\ncentury as a free and democratic nation. But he does so at\na very trying time; he must steer the ship of state on very\nturbulent waters, with global forecasts painting a picture\nof even more stormy weather ahead.\nAnd the Asian economic crisis rolls on; it is no\nlonger just Asian nor entirely economic. It will wreak\nhavoc anywhere and spare no one. It has already hit the\nPhilippines hard, though perhaps not as badly as some\nother countries. Yet, for us, the only tenable direction to\ngo is forward; to go back is to founder. Thus, the Estrada\nAdministration\u2019s economic policy will remain market-\nfriendly, even as it is pro-poor and pro-business. The\nPhilippines will keep the momentum of economic reform\nand strengthen in particular its financial and banking\nsectors.\nLike all other States, the Philippines pursues foreign\npolicy to promote national security and development. But\nwe view national security beyond the traditional concerns\nof sovereignty and territorial integrity. For in a global\nregime characterized by evolving multipolarity of political\nand military power and by growing economic and\nfinancial interdependence, with all their attendant\nopportunities and risks, my nation\u2019s peace and prosperity\nincreasingly depend on stability and growth abroad. As\nPresident Estrada has said, our way of life, our\nfundamental values and our institutions can flourish and\nfind true expression only if we enjoy political stability,\neconomic solidarity, sociocultural cohesion, moral\nconsensus and ecological balance, at home as well as with\nour partners in the world. Our national security and\ndevelopment demand that we actively advance the\ninternationally shared goals of freedom, openness, peace,\nprosperity and justice.\nIt is in this context that the Philippines regards the\nUnited Nations, which it helped found 53 years ago, as a\nmost important partner in our efforts to promote our own\nnational security and development.\nOur part of the world, the Asia-Pacific region, is the\nscene of growing regional cooperation coexisting side by\nside with regional tensions. The Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has not only increased its\nmembership but has also expanded its work from the\npurely economic and social to the security and political\nfields. It took the lead in creating the ASEAN Regional\nForum \u2014 the only regional security dialogue mechanism\nthat brings together all the Powers with a stake in peace\nand stability in East Asia and the Western Pacific. The\nPhilippines hosted the fifth ASEAN Regional Forum last\nJuly and is gratified with the growing trust and\nconfidence among Forum participants and with the\n6\n\n\nprogress in the promotion of greater transparency and\nmutual understanding in the region.\nNevertheless, the Asia-Pacific region is not tension-\nfree. Territorial disputes and issues left over from the\nSecond World War fester. The Philippines hopes that as the\nnew millennium dawns meaningful action towards the\nresolution of such issues will commence in earnest among\nthe countries concerned.\nPeace in the Korean peninsula is essential. The\nPhilippines supports ongoing efforts, including those of the\nFour-Party Talks and of the Korean Peninsula Energy\nDevelopment Organization (KEDO), to build the\nfoundations of peace in the Korean peninsula.\nPeace in the South China Sea is crucial to peace and\nprosperity in East Asia. The Philippines encourages all\nparties concerned to scrupulously observe the principles\ncontained in the ASEAN Declaration on the South China\nSea of 1992.\nThe ratification of the Treaty establishing the African\nEconomic Community augurs well for Africa. The efforts\nat conflict resolution and prevention by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations such as\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), deserve to be lauded.\nNonetheless, one cannot escape the fact that the more\nintense of today\u2019s conflicts have occurred in Africa. The\ntragic events in Rwanda, in Burundi, between Ethiopia and\nEritrea, in Sierra Leone and now in the Congo are familiar\nto us all. Although these States are responsible for their\nfuture, the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa\ndemand a multilateral response to the political, economic\nand social ills of the region, and the need to address\ndevelopment issues is paramount. We also cannot afford to\nignore the humanitarian disasters such as those in the\nSudan. Indeed, political stability is required in Africa, but\nso is aid. Let no one in this Hall forget Africa and our\ncollective duty to alleviate human suffering there.\nThe Philippines firmly hopes that the Middle East\npeace process will resume in earnest and encompass all\nrelevant parties. We reaffirm the need to achieve a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\nThe growing number of signatures to and ratifications\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\nthe review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) raised hopes that nuclear weapons\nwere becoming obsolete. Unfortunately, the nuclear-\nweapon States have yet to live up to their NPT\ncommitments. Moreover, the recent nuclear tests in South\nAsia were a destabilizing development.\nThe proliferation of missile technology and\ncapability is just as fraught with danger, if not more\ndangerous, than the spread of nuclear weapons. These two\nmake for a deadly combination for everyone; both must\nbe stopped. So, too, must the continuing development and\nstockpiling of other weapons of mass destruction cease.\nLikewise, we need to put an end to the unregulated\ntransfer and indiscriminate and often illegal circulation of\nsmall arms and light weapons.\nThe Philippines is also deeply committed to the\nbanning and destruction of anti-personnel landmines. My\nGovernment is deeply gratified that our common intense\neffort to conclude the Convention on anti-personnel mines\nsucceeded last December. We strongly urge States that\nhave not yet done so to sign the Convention. We urge all\nto assist in landmine clearance and the rehabilitation of\nlandmine victims.\nPolitical instability and the collapse of peace and\norder in any State produce deleterious effects, including\nsecurity threats for others. For this reason, the Philippines\ncontributes where it can to the establishment or\nrestoration of political stability in other lands, particularly\nin support of democracy.\nCambodia\u2019s recently held elections have been judged\nfree and fair. But, as recent developments in that country\nshow, democratic elections, while necessary, are not a\nsufficient condition for democracy or for peace and\nstability. Cooperation by all Cambodian parties, prompted\nby a deeper love for the nation\u2019s good, is required.\nThe efforts of the ASEAN troika, the Friends of\nCambodia and the United Nations have not been in vain;\nthey have just not been enough. Much could be done by\nthe international community; but so much more needs to\nbe done by the Cambodians themselves to pull their\ncountry back from the brink.\nThe Philippines hopes to see a fully stable South-\nEast Asia, where all peoples enjoy peace and national\nreconciliation. We hope to see all 10 countries in the\nregion working together for a united and outward-looking\nSouth-East Asia, bonded in a partnership of dynamic\ndevelopment and in a community of caring societies.\nThus, we are committed to assisting Myanmar and Laos\n7\n\n\nin their integration into a peaceful, prosperous, humane and\njust ASEAN.\nPeace and order are threatened by the evils of\nterrorism and transnational crime. Terrorism is a crime\nagainst humanity, and we strongly condemn it.\nTransnational crime in all its guises, including drug-\ntrafficking, trafficking in women and children, and money-\nlaundering, must be stopped. The Philippines joins the rest\nof the international community in hailing the adoption of\nthe Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. I wish\nto convey my Government\u2019s serious intention to consider\nthe matter of accession to that treaty in the near future.\nThe world needs economic solidarity. And the Asian\ncrisis, which has spread to other regions, is our immediate\nglobal concern. For in its wake, millions of lives have been\nafflicted, with untold suffering. In its path, nations may fall.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions have played a vital role in\nthe global economy. But it is now clear that their methods\nand their resources, particularly those of the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), are sorely insufficient to contain the\ncrisis and to restore the health of afflicted economies. We\nneed to replenish IMF resources, augment the funds of the\nWorld Bank and the regional banks, and develop new\nremedies for the new problems of a globalized economy.\nThe United Nations can play a significant role in\nfostering international cooperation and action to solve the\nglobal crisis and mitigate its effects. Together, we can fight\nprotectionism. The suffering spawned by the crisis must be\naddressed. The significant decline in official development\nassistance from donor countries needs to be reversed. Now\nmore than ever, social amelioration programmes and safety\nnets must be enhanced.\nThe crisis has forced us, too, to focus attention on the\nquality of governance. The issues of corruption and\ncronyism have been catapulted to the top of national\ndebates. The ensuing convergence of ideas and resolve\ntowards greater transparency and a more level playing field,\nat home and throughout the world, should be boons to our\npeoples and nations.\nThe financial crisis has also confronted us with the\nreality that the world is dealing with a new phenomenon.\nThis is the phenomenon of massive amounts of capital\nflowing across national borders at lightning speed, bloating\neconomies into fragile bubbles as they rush in and shaking\neconomies to their foundations as they are withdrawn. This\nis one aspect of globalization that carries great peril. It\nrequires much diligent study and delicate handling.\nWe have long recognized the need to recast the\nglobal trading regime and make it more responsive to the\nrequirements of our time. Our efforts on this are well\nadvanced. Now we must begin the work on the global\nfinancial system. Together, we must plan and build a new\narchitecture that best suits today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s needs.\nThe Philippines welcomes President Clinton\u2019s eight-\npoint agenda to lead the world out of the current global\neconomic and financial instability. Real action is what the\nworld, not just Asia, needs urgently. Indeed, threatening\nclouds are overhead. Lives are needlessly shattered. We\nneed to limit the damage now and start rebuilding as soon\nas we can.\nAnother lesson the crisis teaches us is about how\nbrittle and fleeting high growth in gross domestic product\nis. It is not difficult to associate the roots of civil unrest\nin the wake of economic hardships with the lack of social\njustice on the ground. The poor, who get hit first and\nhardest in any economic downturn, will always be restive\nif development yields dividends only for the rich. The\ncrisis makes us realize that the fruits of prosperity and the\npains of sacrifice must be enjoyed or borne equitably.\nThe globalization of information and the media may\nhave reduced cultural barriers to the point of\nhomogenizing certain cultural aspects of life. But the\nworld continues to suffer from cultural intolerance. The\nplight of children, the rights and advancement of women\nand human rights in general still need to be addressed\nvigorously by the international community. The\ncontinuing exploitation of children for pornography,\nprostitution and drug-trafficking, not to mention the\nsuffering of displaced and refugee children, is a global\nproblem. The Convention on the Rights of the Child\nshould guide international action in this area. At the\nregional level, the Philippines and the United Kingdom,\nunder the aegis of the Asia-Europe Meeting, have\nlaunched a joint initiative on child welfare with a view to\ncreating a better international cooperation mechanism on\nthis endeavour.\nThe Philippines attaches great importance to the\npromotion and protection of the rights of migrant workers\nand their families, and we continue to call upon all\ncountries to accede to the International Convention on the\nProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and\nMembers of Their Families.\nAll human rights \u2014 political, civil, social and\neconomic \u2014 are universal, indivisible, interdependent and\n8\n\n\ninterrelated. So long as any or all of these rights are not\nrespected globally, we cannot rest, even as we celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. For the Philippines, the best and surest way to\npromote social justice and human rights is through a sincere\ncommitment to the rule of law. And one law that is self-\nevident and immutable in all cultures is the sanctity of\nhuman life and the dignity of the human person.\nMany of the international commitments made at the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, particularly Agenda 21, remain unfulfilled.\nAnd sadly, no new or additional resources needed by\ndeveloping countries to implement many of the actions\nagreed at the Summit have materialized. We appeal for\nearly action on these points.\nSustainable development continues to be an important\nfocus of Philippine foreign policy. As Chair of the sixth\nsession of the Commission on Sustainable Development, the\nPhilippines emphasized the role of civil society in the\nimplementation of cooperative activities in key areas such\nas freshwater resources, the role of industry, technology\ntransfer and capacity-building in development.\nLast April, the Philippines signed the Kyoto Protocol\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange. We join other States parties to the Convention in\nurging the speedy entry into force of that Protocol.\nAddressing global challenges and problems requires\ninternational action and cooperation. The United Nations\nremains the principal multilateral forum for the initiation of\nsuch action and cooperation. As a founding member, the\nPhilippines recognizes that the United Nations must have\nthe active support of all its Members and adequate\nresources in order to be effective. We have supported the\nvarious reform exercises undertaken in the past years, and\nwe will continue to do so, to ensure the continued relevance\nof this our reliable partner.\nInasmuch as the overwhelming majority of United\nNations members are from the developing world, the United\nNations reform process must restore development issues to\nthe core of the United Nations agenda. It should also enable\nthe General Assembly to fulfil effectively its Charter-\nmandated responsibilities.\nThere is a pressing need to modernize and reform the\nSecurity Council. The Council is the United Nations organ\nwith the primary responsibility for maintaining international\npeace and security, and its decisions must be viewed as\nserving the collective interest of all United Nations\nMembers. Thus, its membership must be enlarged to\ninclude more key global players and developing countries.\nIts working methods and decision-making processes\nshould become more transparent and democratic.\nAs a democracy, the Philippines is convinced that\nglobal efforts and cooperation to achieve peace, prosperity\nand development can succeed only if democracy thrives\nwithin nations and serves as the basis for relations\nbetween and among them. At the global level, this\nrequires respect for the principle of sovereign equality\namong States, the commitment to enrich, not beggar, one\nanother, the need to uphold and defend the principles of\nthe United Nations Charter and international law, the\npacific settlement of disputes, the promotion of all human\nrights, and respect for the one and only world we live in.\nWithout exception, all nations need to cooperate and be\npart of the solution to all the world\u2019s woes. For we are all\nin this together, and there are no others to blame. As\nShakespeare admonished, \u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not\nin our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings\u201c\n(Julius Caesar, Act I, scene 2).\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "A\nunanimous tribute has been paid to you, Sir, and, through\nyou, to your country, Uruguay, by your election to the\npresidency at this session of the General Assembly. I am\npleased to join in that tribute by congratulating you on\nthis well-deserved distinction and wishing you all success\nin the discharge of your mission.\nI should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Udovenko, who was able to meet our expectations in\nexemplary fashion at a time when our Organization was\nembarking on a course of reform. Mr. Kofi Annan has\nfully committed himself, with imagination and courage, to\nthat same course of reform, and he has succeeded in\nmaking strides that call for our sincere expression of\ngratitude and recognition.\nThat reform is now on the right course. It is meeting\nthe collective expectations that have been expressed. But\nmore than that, it comes at the right moment, just as new\nproblems are arising to test our skills in diagnosing the\nnew challenges and in formulating policies that are\ncapable of responding to these challenges and aspirations.\nHowever new these problems may be, they are a\nnatural consequence of humanity\u2019s progress towards the\nfulfilment of its destiny. They have arisen out of the\nunprecedentedly swift changes that have taken place in\ninternational relations for a full decade.\nThese problems have names. They present\nchallenges that were heretofore unknown to us, and they\ndemand solutions that go beyond our customary\nframeworks of thought, analysis and action. Let us first\nidentify these problems by their names: globalization,\ninterdependence, development, peace and collective\nsecurity.\nThese are but workshops which nourish our diverse\ndebates and contradictory approaches. They raised\ncertainties on the part of some and doubts and warnings\non the part of others. Until now, the debate has been\nlimited to exchanges of ideas, confined to the approaches\nor projections that each of us has formulated from our\nown perspectives, our own calculations and our own\n20\n\n\nnational interests. Today, the facts themselves have been\ndetermined. It is incumbent upon us to confront what\nyesterday was nothing but conjecture and today is a living\nreality, in keeping with the principles and ideals of the\nUnited Nations which our countries embody.\nThis is the case with globalization, which was long\npresented to us as being capable of ensuring universal\nprosperity, and to which was attributed the virtue of\nlimitless growth. However, many of our countries have\nexpressed their doubts, their warnings of the dislocations\nand dangers which would result from a globalization which\nlacks the least means of appropriate regulation, coordination\nand monitoring. In the absence of such instruments of\nregulation, coordination and monitoring, and given the\nacknowledged shortcomings of the existing mechanisms,\nglobalization rightly gives rise more often to doubts and\nfears than to support and conviction.\nThere is no better illustration of the tragic\nconsequences which could result from those dislocations\nthan the Asian crisis, the results of which are still\nunfolding, threatening the economies of many regions of\nthe world to such a degree that the spectre of widespread\nrecession has re-emerged. In fact, rather than being a force\nfor integration, globalization has turned into a force for\nexclusion and marginalization.\nThis state of affairs forces us to think collectively\nabout how to reimbue globalization with its original and\nideal purpose so that it can meet the aspirations placed in\nit for universal progress in justice and solidarity.\nGlobalization represents a comprehensive challenge which\nmust be met by comprehensive regulation, coordination and\ndialogue. Until then, the existing mechanisms must be\nstrengthened in their assigned functions of prevention and\ninterposition.\nFinally, regional integration as an integral component\nof a well-balanced and carefully monitored globalization,\nmust be accompanied by bold and effective initiatives.\nThe problem of interdependence is structurally linked\nto that of globalization. The arrival of an age of\ninterdependence among nations has fed the great hope of\ncreating and diversifying the bonds that are necessary for\nexpanding the area of cooperation and exchange among our\ncountries. However, the erosion of international cooperation\nfor development, as well as the imbalances in the present\nsystem of world economic relations, still represent basic\nimpediments on the road to crystallizing true interdependent\nrelationships.\nAt the core of the problem of globalization and\ninterdependence is development \u2014 a crucial problem,\nwhich has not yet received the attention that is due to it.\nOn the contrary, it is increasingly marginalized in our\ndiscussions today, as well as in the design of world\neconomic policies.\nFinally, the problem of peace and collective security\nhas encountered new challenges other than those with\nwhich it was identified before and which still exist till\ntoday.\nFrom this perspective, I speak of the phenomenon of\nterrorism. Terrorism has no respect for human life and is\ncapable of perpetrating the most vile crimes against\nhumankind. By its logic of terror, death and destruction,\nit seeks to strike at the foundations of every civilized\nsociety. For these reasons, terrorism is truly characterized\nas the most serious threat to our societies and the nations\nof the world as a whole.\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon which calls for a\nglobal response from the international community. Algeria\nis pleased to note that after having underestimated and\nincorrectly analysed terrorism for a long time, the\ninternational community increasingly seems to be more\ncognizant of its dangers and aware that the time has come\nto supplement unilateral and isolated action on the part of\nStates fighting terrorism with collective and resolute\naction.\nWith this perspective in mind, conditions are now\nright for us to go beyond mere verbal condemnation of\nterrorism to ensure that intentions and actions would\nreally go hand in hand through effective international\ncooperation whose goal is to fight terrorism. The\nelimination of this scourge is no longer a mere moral\nobligation for humankind. It has also become a political\nnecessity in an age of interdependence and globalization.\nFor that reason Algeria believes that the time has\ncome to give serious consideration to the preparation of\na global convention to prevent and fight all acts of\nterrorism and to serve as a legal framework for the\norganization and implementation of international\ncooperation in that matter. Such a project should take\nshape as of now in the form of concerted and sustained\naction on the part of the entire international community to\ndismantle terrorism\u2019s multifaceted support networks and\nrear bases, dry up its financial resources and bring to trial\nthe perpetrators of terrorist acts and their accomplices and\nabettors. The convening of a world summit on terrorism,\n21\n\n\nwhich received broad support in this Assembly, would be\na basic step in that direction. Algeria fully supports the idea\nof such a summit and stands completely ready to make its\ncontribution to it.\nIn view of Algeria\u2019s belonging to several spheres \u2014\nthe Maghreb, the Mediterranean, the Arab and the\nAfrican \u2014 it has constructed its foreign policy on the\nprinciples of openness, solidarity, good-neighbourliness and\ncooperation. Algeria embodies these principles in its\nimmediate environment, the Maghreb, convinced that only\na united Maghreb community would serve the cause of\npeace, stability and the development of the countries of our\nregion.\nThese same principles have moved Algeria to tireless\nsupport for a just and definitive solution to the conflict in\nWestern Sahara. We fully support the United Nations\nsettlement plan, in cooperation with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, which calls for the holding of a free, fair\nand impartial referendum on self-determination.\nLike the rest of the international community, Algeria\nwelcomes the Houston accord, through which the two\nparties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the\nPOLISARIO front, solemnly agreed on the practical\nmodalities for implementing the provisions of the settlement\nplan under the auspices of the United Nations. Today, one\nyear after the conclusion of that accord, and despite the\nreal, significant progress resulting, in large part, from the\nefforts of the Secretary-General, of his Personal Envoy\nMr. James Baker, and of his Special Representative, serious\nobstacles still stand in the path to the plan\u2019s\nimplementation. If they are not overcome, these obstacles,\nwhich the Secretary-General has clearly identified in\nsuccessive reports, along with their causes, could seriously\ncompromise the chances of holding the long-awaited\nreferendum.\nTherefore it is now necessary to solemnly and urgently\nappeal for full and strict respect for the commitments\nundertaken and to reaffirm the responsibility of the United\nNations, in particular the Security Council, with regard to\nthe full and strict implementation of the settlement plan and\nthe Houston accord so as to ensure that the people of the\nWestern Sahara can exercise their inalienable right to selfdetermination.\nAs in the Maghreb, Algeria has been working in the\nMediterranean to ensure that there will be an atmosphere of\nstability, peace, cooperation and prosperity. The machinery\nfor consultation and cooperation that was set up through the\nBarcelona process has opened new horizons for the\ndevelopment of a true partnership between the two shores\nof that shared sea, a partnership directed towards\ndeveloping a zone of shared prosperity in the\nMediterranean. In this context, Algeria undertook\nnegotiations on an agreement of association with the\nEuropean Union aimed at putting in place the conditions\nnecessary for renewed and mutually beneficial\ncooperation between the two parties.\nWithin the same Mediterranean region, and after the\nlaunching of the peace process which raised great hopes,\nfeelings of anxiety and pessimism have again returned\nsince the peace mechanism has become stalemated.\nThe Israeli Administration, by reneging on\ncommitments made in Oslo and Washington, by\nabandoning the principle of land for peace, by continuing\nits settlement policy and by repeatedly attacking the\nintegrity and sacredness of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, has led to\nthe undermining of the peace process, rekindling the\nfrustrations and anger of the Palestinian people and\nthreatening the entire region with a return to the era of\nconfrontation which prevailed there for more than 40\nyears.\nIn order to deal with this perilous situation, we must\nrecall that the just, comprehensive and lasting settlement\nto the conflict in the Middle East requires the full and\nunconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the\nPalestinian and occupied Arab territories and the exercise\nof the right of self-determination by the Palestinian\npeople, including the establishment of its own State with\nAl-Quds as its capital.\nIn the same part of the world, the suffering of the\nbrotherly Iraqi people continues to dismay us. In this\nregard, we cannot but reiterate our call for the rapid\nlifting of the embargo on Iraq. Similarly, we renew the\nsame call with regard to the brotherly Libyan people, who\nare also the victims of cruel economic sanctions, which\nwe hope will be lifted soon, in view of the recent positive\ndevelopments in the Lockerbie case.\nIn its relations with its African neighbours, as in its\nrelations with other African countries, Algeria has always\nworked to ensure that there will be strong bonds of\ncooperation and solidarity with a view to achieving the\npolitical and economic unification of the continent.\nIntrastate and inter-State conflicts in Africa can only\ndamage this ambitious and legitimate project. We\ntherefore call for the settlement of these conflicts and\n22\n\n\ncrises by utilizing existing African mechanisms, particularly\nthe Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution, on the basis of respect for the territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty of States and also the frontiers\ninherited from colonialization.\nFor a decade Africa has been making profound\npolitical, economic and social reforms for which the\ninternational community must provide resolute and\nmeaningful support, as the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization called for in his comprehensive and thorough\nreport.\nIn less than two months the international community\nwill be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Such anniversaries provide\na good opportunity for collective self-review, which impels\nus to acknowledge that in the field of human rights, the\nsituation is certainly much better than it was 50 years ago.\nThe people\u2019s liberation movement and the global spread of\ndemocracy have certainly played a crucial role in promoting\nand consolidating human rights.\nThere can be no doubt that the significant progress\nmade in democratization and the establishment within the\nState of the rule of law will remain fragile and will be\nendangered unless they are accompanied by meeting the\neconomic, social and cultural needs of the citizens. This is\nbecause true democracy cannot take root permanently and\nsoundly in places of deprivation and want.\nIn this connection and in the name of my country, I\nwish to reaffirm our strong attachment to the universality,\ninterdependence and indivisibility of human rights and our\nresolute commitment to promote them free from any\nmanipulation or politicization.\nIf we wish to sum up these complex and multifarious\nchallenges facing mankind today, this could be done\nthrough one essential question: how can we make sure that\nthe evolving new world order will be more just and more\nsecure, will have greater solidarity and will truly address\nthe interests and aspirations of everyone?\nThat is the question which, of course, involves our\ncountry, and through it, mankind as a whole. And what\nbetter forum to answer this question is there than the\nUnited Nations, which brings us together and through\nwhose Charter we have proclaimed our determination \u201cto\npractise tolerance and live together in peace with one\nanother as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to\nmaintain international peace and security, and ... to employ\ninternational machinery for the promotion of the\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples\u201d.\nThe challenges of the present are embodied in these\nbasic values and these shared purposes. In fact, the\nprimacy given to these values and the attainment of these\npurposes are contingent on our ability to mobilize our\ncollective energies. Mankind, which has mastered science\nand technology, has achieved considerable progress in the\nutilization of the resources of our world and has\nestablished its control over the means of its progress.\nNow it has in its hands the keys to its destiny. Using the\nkeys to its destiny for the common good depends on\nhumankind, and on humankind alone.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The election of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession is a source of pride for Latin America and the\nCaribbean. I am personally familiar with the talent,\nexperience and diplomatic skill of Minister Opertti and I\nam convinced that these qualities will help to guide,\nmotivate and strengthen our work.\nMy delegation would also like to express its\nappreciation to Hennadiy Udovenko for the outstanding\nwork that he accomplished as President at the session that\njust closed.\nLast July, we had the honour of welcoming our\nSecretary-General to Mexico. On that occasion we\nobserved anew his firm and resolute commitment to\nstrengthen the United Nations, adapting it to confront the\nchallenges of the end of the century. We recognize in\nKofi Annan a man with a clear vision of the future of the\nOrganization, and we are confident that he will know how\nto guide it in this transition stage towards a new\nmillennium.\nMexico is a country with a profound multilateral\ncalling. Our desire to seek international agreement finds\nfertile ground for development in this forum. It is for this\nreason that we are convinced of the urgent need to\nstrengthen it and to seek within it shared answers to the\nchallenges that the new global agenda presents.\nMexico\u00e2s commitment to the United Nations does\nnot consist of words alone. A week ago, the Government\nof President Ernesto Zedillo reconfirmed this by sending\nthe International Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\nFamilies to the Mexican Senate for approval. From the\nvery beginning of negotiations on that Convention, over\nwhich Mexico had the honour of presiding, we insisted on\nthe importance of having legal instruments to ensure\nrespect for and protection of the rights of migrant\nworkers. By taking that step, Mexico is showing its\nunswerving commitment to the norms of international law\nand is making progress in consolidating itself as a State\nof law.\nConvinced of the need to strengthen the international\nsystem that makes it possible for us to have the will and\nthe necessary instruments to confront together the\nchallenges of the end of the century, President Zedillo\npromoted the convening of the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the problem of drugs. As of\nthat meeting, principles of responsibility shared among\nStates and of strict respect for sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of\nStates replaced the scenario of mutual recrimination and\nunilateral evaluations. We now have the bases for a global\nconsensus regarding the policies that must be adopted by\n8\n\n\nStates in order to consolidate an unprecedented effort at\ncooperation based on this new global, integral and balanced\nstrategy. Mexico will not regress in its efforts to implement\nthe commitments that we adopted last June.\nThe international agenda today, as reflected in the\nagenda of the General Assembly, is very broad and\ncomplex. I would like to refer on this occasion to only\nthree questions which I consider to be of particular\nrelevance: disarmament, which has been a constant issue in\nMexico\u00e2s foreign policy; the reform of our Organization,\nwhich will help to shape the community of nations in the\nnext century; and the international financial crisis, which\ngreatly jeopardizes the efforts of our countries to attain full\ndevelopment, as well as our ability to advance towards the\nfuture.\nAs far as the subject of disarmament is concerned,\nthere is no doubt that the existence of nuclear arsenals\nremains one of the central problems in international\nrelations. The threat of an atomic conflagration cannot be\ndisregarded, and we must reiterate our commitment to\nfashioning a world which is free of nuclear weapons. For\nMexico, the objective of eliminating these instruments of\nmass destruction is realistic and viable. It is time to set\naside arguments that, for strategic reasons, have served to\nconceal the efforts of those who either do not want to give\nup their present nuclear capacity or else want to join the\ngroup of countries that possess this destructive ability. One\ncan contribute to nuclear disarmament only by eliminating\nnuclear weapons. This is why we seek to broaden and\nstrengthen international commitments in this respect. Our\npolitical conviction is that we must achieve new agreements\nthat remove this scourge from humankind.\nMexico condemns all nuclear testing from principle\nand out of conviction. We affirmed this recently in the light\nof the tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Far from\ncontributing to stability and regional balance, such actions\npromote the proliferation of uncertainty and fear. They also\ncontribute to a climate conducive to the nuclear arms race.\nI would like on this occasion to reiterate Mexico\u00e2s\nconviction that dialogue and negotiation are and will remain\nthe irreplaceable means of resolving disputes. It was in that\nspirit that last 9 July we supported a ministerial statement\nthat sought to define a new agenda for the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction. We co-sponsors of that\ndeclaration introduced a draft resolution that we hope will\nreceive the resolute support of Member States so that we\ncan in that way demonstrate the resolve of the community\nof nations to move towards a world free of nuclear\nweapons.\nWe are also committed to a new, integral approach\nto the subject of disarmament and the prohibition of\nweapons of mass destruction or weapons with excessively\ncruel and inhuman effects. There has been progress\nrecently in the Conference on Disarmament related to\nsecurity guarantees and the prohibition on the production\nof fissionable materials destined to be used for such\nweapons.\nWe are likewise pleased at the growing support\nbeing given to the treaties on anti-personnel landmines\nand on chemical and bacteriological weapons. In\nparticular, we are gratified at the entry into force on\n1 March 1999 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Once again we\nurge the countries that have not yet done so to ratify as\nsoon as possible these conventions that seek to eliminate\nsuch weapons from the face of the Earth.\nThe proliferation of small arms and its link with\ncriminal organizations and drug-trafficking constitute a\nsignificant challenge to the majority of nations.\nCombating this is a priority of the Government of\nMexico. The Inter-American Convention against the Illicit\nManufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,\nAmmunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials,\nwhich was the result of a Mexican initiative, is of crucial\nimportance and should therefore be taken into account in\nfurther negotiations on transnational crime.\nIn the present situation, which demands that we\nclearly define the framework for international relations\nand adapt it in a timely way, the initiatives for reforming\nour Organization presented by the Secretary-General\nacquire special significance. The United Nations must\nreform itself if it is to remain a central force in our\ncollective lives.\nWe must recognize that traditional mechanisms for\nharmonization and negotiation are showing clear signs of\nexhaustion. We must rethink these strategies in order to\ndeal with old and new problems. The consolidation of a\nstructure which is truly democratic, transparent and well\nbalanced, and which is consistent with the purpose and\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter must be our\ncommon goal.\n9\n\n\nIn this context, I wish to stress the importance of\nachieving a better balance between the principal organs of\nthe United Nations. The Security Council needs to be\nreformed in order to strengthen its legitimacy,\nrepresentativeness, effectiveness, democracy and\ntransparency. In considering its structure, we must correct\nthe deficiencies in its present composition. It is not a matter\nof size; rather, the problem is the lack of balance in its\nrepresentativeness. The Security Council must reflect the\nplurality and diversity of the membership of the United\nNations, taking into account the profound changes in\npolitical geography experienced in the last decade.\nLikewise, we must avoid repeating or even broadening\nexisting inequalities. For this reason, Mexico is against\nincreasing the number of permanent members. Let us not\nfall into the fallacy of believing that the Council\u00e2s\neffectiveness resides in the right of veto. All rights bear\nresponsibilities and these must not be abused. Otherwise,\nthe necessary legitimacy which makes the Security Council\nefficient and effective is eroded. This is why I wish to\nreiterate our appeal to the permanent members to join in an\nopen-minded way in designing a system to regulate the\nsphere of application of that privilege.\nNonetheless, we recognize that structural reform of the\nSecurity Council will not in itself guarantee its\neffectiveness. Hence, we insist on the need to progress\ntowards a thorough revision of its working methods and of\nthe decision-making process. The community of nations has\ngiven that organ the high responsibility of ensuring\ninternational peace and security. Under paragraph 1 of\nArticle 24 of the Charter, the members of the Organization\nrecognize that the Council acts in our name in carrying out\nthese functions.\nIt is therefore clear that the Security Council\u00e2s attitude\nmust be profoundly democratic and one of respect towards\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with paragraph 3 of\nthe same Article. Anything else would be a violation of the\nletter and spirit of the Charter, and would mean an erosion\nof the Council\u00e2s legitimacy and its capacity to fulfil the\nresponsibilities that we have entrusted to it. We must break\nthis vicious circle and make serious progress in the design\nand implementation of the needed reforms.\nMy country will continue to participate actively in the\nWorking Group charged with reform of the Security\nCouncil. We hope to be able to submit to the Assembly\nrecommendations that can receive widespread support,\ngenuinely reflecting the collective aspirations of all the\nmembers of the United Nations.\nOur concerns about international security and the\ncapacity of our multilateral forums to respond effectively\nto new challenges are compounded today by the\nuncertainty caused by the international financial crisis.\nIt is obvious that the Bretton Woods system has\nshown its inability to respond adequately to the challenges\nof the current international financial crisis. We are\nundoubtedly faced with a situation of high risk which\nthreatens to erode the important development attainments\nof our emerging economies. Given the vicissitudes of the\ninternational financial situation, we, the countries of Latin\nAmerica, have endeavoured to maintain our economic\nstrength through profound and sometimes difficult\nprocesses of structural reform. We reaffirm our\ncommitment to continue to manage in a responsible way\nthe economic policy mechanisms that ensure our stability\nand growth.\nIt is clear that this is not enough and that concerted\naction is needed on the part of all countries and\ninternational financial organs. Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Rio Group meeting in Panama on\n4-5 September urged the countries in which the financial\ncrisis originated to adopt the measures needed to correct\ntheir imbalances. They made an appeal to the countries of\nthe Group of 7 to immediately take the necessary\nmeasures to restore stability to financial markets and to\nensure the growth of the world economy. The Rio Group\nalso appealed to international financial institutions to be\ninvolved more quickly and effectively in finding solutions\nto the international financial crisis.\nOvercoming the present situation must be our\npriority. We must be creative in order to find formulas\nthat make it possible for us to avoid recurring financial\ncrises and banish the spectre of global recession. Just as\nthe community of nations has recognized the wisdom of\npreventive action to protect international peace and\nsecurity, it is now necessary to take that same course in\norder to prevent cracks in the fabric of the world\neconomy.\nWe must consider ways of implementing an early\nwarning system that will allow us to detect financial\ncrises in time and thus avoid their harmful effects. In the\nrecent past, there have been warning signs which in\nisolation were not identified as a prelude to more serious\nproblems. We must collect such experiences, learn from\nthem and prepare ourselves better for the future.\n10\n\n\nNo country is free from responsibilities, just as no\ncountry is free of the effects of international financial\nimbalances. It is therefore up to us together and with a\nclear sense of direction to seek the proper mechanisms to\nrespond early to signs that larger problems are imminent. In\nthis universal forum, I reiterate our conviction that we must\nact resolutely in the short term. We need to define an\nagenda for international economic stability. We appeal to\nthe Secretary-General so that, under his leadership and\nguidance, we can share experiences and proposals that will\nhelp us work toward global financial security.\nBy attaining that goal of preventive diplomacy, we\nwill be contributing to the development and well-being of\nmillions of persons who are victims of the financial\nuncertainty that today afflicts all economies, particularly\nthose of a relatively lower level of development, and\nendangers the stability of all nations.\nIn the face of an uncertain political and economic\npanorama, the role of the United Nations takes on new\nrelevance. Recent changes on the international scene yield\nunprecedented opportunities but at the same time present\nchallenges for which there are no easy answers. We must\nact together in order to encourage the necessary consensus\nas that will allow us to take advantage of the benefits of\nglobalization and confront its challenges.\nWe must fortify our individual and collective capacity\nin order to take advantage of the positive trends towards\npeace, stability, development and respect for law. Likewise,\nwe must strengthen our ability to banish confrontation,\nviolence, terror and inequality.\nThe United Nations is the necessary forum for facing\ninternational problems and finding solutions to them. As we\nreaffirm our commitment to the purposes of the San\nFrancisco Charter, we shall continue to promote the\nparticipation of the United Nations in the definition of the\nparameters of international coexistence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The threat from weapons of mass destruction is\nas alarming as ever. A majority of the Earth\u00e2s population\nstill lives in poverty.

No one can escape the\nforces of globalization, but all of us can join not only in\nconfronting transnational threats but also in collecting the\nfruits of globalization. The United Nations has a key part\nto play in this collective effort.

It is\nimperative that industrial and developing countries elaborate\na common strategy in a framework of international financial\ncooperation, including the G-22, and formulate standards\nand rules for financial transactions. What is needed now is\nleadership. Short-term remedies are not enough; long-term\nforward looking policies are required. We must invest in\nboth sustainable growth and solidarity. As serious as the\ncrisis is, there is every reason not to panic. The world\neconomy is basically sound, with two thirds \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 70 per\ncent \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of the world\u00e2s population living in growth zones.\nWe sometimes forget that.\nThe European model of social market economy has\nserved well to harness the forces of globalization.\nRespecting the interests and wishes of the people, showing\nsolidarity for the poor and disadvantaged, promoting social\npartnership between employers and employees and\ncombating unemployment by creating jobs and so on are\nintrinsic elements of a social market economy. We believe\nthat this European model of a social market economy\ndeserves serious consideration in our turbulent and complex\nage. To be honest, this is a kind of third way some are\nlooking for.\nEurope\u00e2s answer to the challenges of globalization is\ntwo millennium projects which will shape the face of our\ncontinent: the introduction of the euro and the enlargement\nof the Union.\nThe single currency will improve the functioning of\nthe internal market, help to secure employment and provide\nincentives for the market-oriented structural reforms needed\nto safeguard Europe\u00e2s competitiveness. The creation of the\neuro has the potential to stabilize the international economic\nenvironment and to promote international trade. From the\nperspective of the world economy, this will be the most\nimportant effect of the single currency. Markets have\nalready anticipated the introduction of the euro, as borne\nout by the monetary stability of the participating currencies,\nat a time when other countries and regions are experiencing\nsevere financial crises. Consequently, the euro is creating a\nzone of stability and prosperity which will benefit the entire\nworld economy.\nThe second millennium project, which has far-reaching\nconsequences, is the enlargement of the European Union.\nWe are convinced that the integration of our neighbours is\nthe best way to safeguard lasting political stability and\neconomic progress in Europe. Successful enlargement will\nbring a new dynamic to the Union and strengthen its role\nto the benefit of all the citizens of both Europe and the\nworld. The process of enlarging the Union does not mean\nthat the Union will become more inward-oriented or\nEurocentric. On the contrary, we are convinced that the\nUnion must continue to be outward- and forward-looking.\nEnlarging the European Union will go hand-in-hand with\ndeveloping our traditional relations with countries and\nexporting stability around the world.\nAs President of the Council of the European Union,\nI would like to assure Members of the United Nations\nthat an enlarged Union with a strong common currency\nwill be a reliable and strong partner for the United\nNations and the world.\nI would like to stress the paramount interest of the\nEuropean Union in the political and economic stability of\nRussia. We hope that the new Government of Russia will\nbe able to re-establish confidence among the Russian\npeople and the international financial community. We\nstand ready to cooperate further with the Russian\nauthorities in support of sustained efforts towards\nstabilization and reform.\nLet me now draw attention to a subject to which I\nattach the highest priority: the protection of the most\nvulnerable group in societies, our children. I am deeply\nconvinced that a far-sighted policy, both internal and\nexternal, should be geared to the well-being of future\ngenerations. We, the statesmen, diplomats and decision\nmakers of 185 nations, meeting in this Assembly, bear an\nenormous responsibility to formulate future-oriented\npolicies in the service of young citizens on our planet.\nThese include a fundamental principle. Our children must\nlive childhood in peace, freedom, prosperity and security,\nfree of abuse, violence and exploitation.\nMillions of children and juveniles are exploited\nworldwide, their basic human rights denied in many ways.\nA global coalition must be forged to fight the abuse of\nchildren, in particular sexual exploitation, the despicable\nphenomenon of child soldiers and child labour.\nThe European Union supports the International\nLabour Organization draft convention on child labour.\nThe involvement of children in armed conflict and its\ndisastrous consequences require particular attention and\naction by the international community. I call upon all\nStates and parties to conflicts to respect existing\ninternational standards, to stop the use of children as\ncombatants and to fully support the work of the\nSecretary-General\u00e2s Special Representative for Children\nin Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu.\n8\n\n\nSexual exploitation of children is one of the most\nabhorrent phenomena of our time. The European Union\nputs special emphasis on combating child prostitution and\nchild pornography. This includes the spread of child\npornography on the Internet. New information technologies\ncreate new challenges. But that is why, more than ever, we\nhave to prohibit the production, dissemination and\npossession of child pornography in all its forms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d print,\naudio, electronic media and video. Many countries have\nalready enacted such legislation nationally. But only a\nworldwide ban on child pornography will be effective. In\nthis context, we hope that the optional protocol on the sale\nof children, child prostitution and child pornography can be\nfinalized in the near future.\nLegislative action has to be complemented by\nimproved cooperation between national and international\nlaw enforcement and judicial authorities. I appeal to\nGovernments, the United Nations, non-governmental\norganizations and private business \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including online\nservices and Internet service providers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to join efforts in\na crusade against child abuse. For every day we fail to do\nso, the innocent children of our world pay a terrible price.\nHuman rights, good and democratic governance and\nthe rule of law have moved to centre stage in promoting\npeace, security and sustainable development. Respect for\nand promotion of human rights have become a crucial\ncomponent of Union policies. They play a significant role\nin contractual relations with third countries, in development\ncooperation and in the common foreign and security policy.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights and the five-year implementation review\nof the Vienna Declaration should provide an opportunity for\na critical assessment of the progress made by all States.\nThe Council of the European Union, in commemorating this\nanniversary on 10 December this year in Vienna, will send\na strong signal to further strengthen the United Nations\nhuman rights programme, in particular the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe European Union will continue to work towards\nthe full integration of human rights, as well as a gender\nperspective, into all activities of the United Nations system.\nWe hope that the adoption of the human rights defenders\ndeclaration will send a strong message of support to human\nrights activists worldwide. The European Union welcomes\nthe progress on a draft protocol to the Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,\nand a draft protocol to the Convention against Torture. We\nhope that the respective Working Groups can complete their\nwork next year.\nI would like to stress our strong interest in\ncooperating with other Governments and civil society to\nimprove the human rights situation in all parts of the\nworld. To this end, the Union supports a wide range of\nprojects and programmes in the field of human rights, the\nrule of law and electoral assistance. We will also work\nfor the complete abolition of the death penalty. In the\nmeantime, we shall call for a moratorium on all\nexecutions worldwide.\nThe international community is confronted with an\nincreasing number of new and more diverse forms of\nconflict, which often turn violent. Apart from taking\nmeasures of operational prevention, which address the\nconsequences of conflicts and range from preventive\ndiplomacy to all forms of peaceful settlement of disputes\nand the preventive deployment of forces, we have to\nconcentrate on the root causes, such as disrespect for\nminorities. We therefore need a pro-active policy,\nfocusing on preventing the outbreak of violence at an\nearly stage.\nEarly warning is a key element of a comprehensive\nstrategy of conflict prevention and a prerequisite for any\nfurther action. Finally, post-conflict rehabilitation has to\nbe more comprehensive and coordinated to address the\nwider issues of humanitarian assistance, reconstruction\nand respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of\nlaw. The European Union firmly supports United Nations\nefforts to strengthen its conflict-prevention and crisis-\nmanagement capacity.\nWe are deeply committed to the primary role of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace\nand security and to the core functions of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. This strong support is reflected\nin the facts: 4,500 troops and policemen from European\nUnion countries serve in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations, which is one third of United Nations\npeacekeeping personnel; thousands more men and women\nfrom the European Union have served and are serving in\nUnited Nations-mandated operations such as the\nStabilization Force in Bosnia; and our financial\ncontribution represents almost 40 per cent of the United\nNations peacekeeping budget.\nWe welcome the increasingly multidimensional\nnature of peacekeeping operations, which poses new\nchallenges to the average peacekeeper in the field.\nPeacekeeping today encompasses not only military tasks\nbut a variety of other functions, such as civilian police\nactivities, humanitarian assistance, demining, disarmament\nmeasures, demobilization, reintegration of former soldiers,\n9\n\n\nenhancing and monitoring respect for human rights and, last\nbut not least, public information. At United Nations\nHeadquarters, this requires a strong Department of\nPeacekeeping Operations which is able to fulfil its functions\neffectively. In the wake of the decision by the General\nAssembly to reduce progressively the number of posts filled\nby personnel on loan, we strongly underline that the\nDepartment\u00e2s expertise and gains of recent years must be\nretained.\nThe European Union is gravely concerned about the\nincreasing security threat to United Nations personnel in the\nfield, not least to unarmed military observers and civilian\npersonnel. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the United\nNations and Member States towards those participating in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, we wish to recall\nthe obligation of host countries and parties to conflicts to\nensure the safety of these operations.\nI would like to express our admiration and gratitude to\nall the men and women who serve under the banner of the\nUnited Nations in peace operations around the globe. They\nshow remarkable courage, motivation and idealism.\nLikewise, I wish to express my deep sympathy to the\nfamilies of United Nations personnel who have lost their\nlives in the service of peace.\nThe European Union attaches the utmost importance\nto progress in the areas of disarmament, arms control and\nnon-proliferation as a key element in the maintenance of\npeace and the strengthening of security. In this respect, the\nUnion wishes to reiterate its deep concern about the grave\nthreat to international peace and security posed by the\nnuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in May this\nyear. The Union has called on both countries to adhere to\ninternational non-proliferation regimes, in particular by\nsigning the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as it\nstands. The Union strongly urges India and Pakistan to\nrefrain from nuclear tests and from the development or\ndeployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable\nmissiles. Likewise, we call on both countries to engage in\na substantive dialogue with each other and to agree on\nconfidence-building measures.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation\nregime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of\nnuclear disarmament. We are committed to the early entry\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nand welcome the recent ratifications by several countries.\nWe call upon all States which have not yet done so to\naccede to it, without any change. The conclusion of a fissile\nmaterial cut-off treaty will constitute a significant\ncontribution to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.\nWe warmly welcome the fact that all impediments to\nstarting such negotiations finally have been overcome, and\nwe are looking forward to contributing to the substantive\nnegotiations. We continue to believe that the systematic\nand progressive efforts by nuclear-weapon States to\nreduce nuclear weapons need to be intensified and\npursued with determination.\nBiological weapons pose grave dangers. It is\nshocking that they can also be produced by non-State\nactors. Therefore, the European Union gives priority to\nstrengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons\nConvention. We strive for the successful conclusion of\nthe negotiations on a legally binding protocol establishing\na verification and compliance regime in 1999. I would\nalso like to underline our commitment to the universality\nand the full and effective implementation of the Chemical\nWeapons Convention, a landmark in the disarmament\nprocess.\nThe European Union reaffirms its commitment to the\ngoal of totally eliminating anti-personnel landmines\nworldwide and welcomes the opening for signature of the\nOttawa Convention. We are pleased that the number of\nsignatories and ratifications is rising steadily and that the\nConvention will enter into force on 1 March 1999. The\nfact that the required number of 40 ratifications was\nreached so quickly underlines the importance that the\ninternational community attaches to this endeavour. The\nEuropean Union, being the major donor to anti-mine\nactivities, is contributing significantly to solving the\nproblems caused by those weapons.\nA serious challenge to the international community\nis raised by the combination of internal conflicts and the\nproliferation of small arms. This issue requires a multi-\npronged response. The Union, for its part, has adopted a\ncode of conduct on arms exports and has thereby set high\ncommon standards. Moreover, we are currently engaged\nin the implementation of the European Union programme\nfor preventing and combating illicit trafficking in\nconventional arms. Under this programme, we will assist\nthird countries in preventing and combating illicit\ntrafficking in arms, and we will also assist affected\ncountries.\nAs we approach the new millennium, nearly a\nquarter of the world\u00e2s people \u00e2\u20ac\u201d foremost among them\nwomen and children \u00e2\u20ac\u201d continue to live in absolute\npoverty, while almost a third more are very poor. While\nthe blight of poverty thus continues to challenge the\ninternational community, recent decades have also shown\n10\n\n\nthat progress in the reduction of poverty is possible. The\ngoal of poverty eradication, through sustained growth and\neconomic and social development, must be placed at the\ncentre of international development cooperation.\nPoverty has many dimensions and needs to be tackled\nin a gender-sensitive and comprehensive way within the\ncontext of sustainable development, based on the\ninterdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of\neconomic development, social development and\nenvironmental protection. The European Union therefore\nattaches great importance to an integrated and coordinated\nfollow-up to global conferences. While the first\nresponsibility lies with Governments, the United Nations\nsystem, as the global framework for international\ncooperation, has a key role to play in supporting and\ncoordinating national efforts.\nA new global partnership between developing\ncountries, developed countries, multilateral institutions and\ncivil society, with emphasis put on local ownership and\ncomplementarity of efforts, must be forged in order to\nachieve people-centred sustainable development. The strong\ncommitment of the Union to such a global partnership is\nbased on its unique position as the world\u00e2s largest provider\nof development assistance.\nAmong the various frameworks, the present Lom\u00c3\u00a9\nConvention, which will expire in February 2000, remains\nessential. During the upcoming negotiations on a successor,\nthe European Union will aim at strengthening its\npartnership with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and\nthe Pacific. Building on the experience gained so far, the\naim is to develop a modern and efficient framework for\ncooperation in order to keep the relationship between the\nUnion and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries\nstrong and prominent in the twenty-first century. I am\nconvinced that cooperation in the context of the Lom\u00c3\u00a9\nConvention will make an effective contribution to\neradicating poverty and integrating the African, Caribbean\nand Pacific countries into our worldwide economic system.\nWe are committed to sustainable development as the\noverarching principle of national policy and international\ncooperation in our policies. Recognizing the central role of\na healthy environment in quality of life, the European\nUnion attaches great importance to reform of the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United\nNations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT). We\nwould welcome more coordination, focus and efficiency in\nthese areas. The Kyoto Protocol, in which the member\nStates of the European Union committed themselves to a\nreduction of 8 per cent in greenhouse gases, constitutes an\nimportant step towards sustainable development. As\ndeveloped countries, we are prepared to take the lead in\ncombating climate change. The European Community and\nits member States are determined to translate the\ncommitments made at Kyoto into concrete actions and\nachievements.\nIn the context of sustainable development, population\nissues are of particular concern. They directly relate to\nhuman health and the quality of life. Over the coming\ndecades, population size and age structure will be\nimportant factors interacting with economic development\nand the environment in all parts of the world. It is\ntherefore very timely that a special session of the General\nAssembly will be convened next year to review and\nappraise the implementation of the Programme of Action\nof the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, held in Cairo in 1994.\nThe fight against drugs is a major priority in the\npolicy of the European Union. The recent special session\nof the General Assembly on the world drug problem was\nan important step in the international effort to counter the\nglobal scourge of drug abuse. I should like to pay tribute\nto the Executive Director of the United Nations Drug\nControl Programme (UNDCP), Pino Arlacchi, and all\nothers involved, for the excellent preparation of the\nsession. Political leaders unanimously endorsed a series of\nimportant documents, including a Political Declaration,\nseveral action plans, time-frames and a number of\nconcrete measures.\nWe welcome the balanced, integrated and gender-\nsensitive anti-drug strategy adopted by the special session.\nOur new commitments embrace efforts on both the supply\nand the demand side, constituting equal parameters of the\ndrug-control equation. In particular, we look forward to\nthe elaboration of an operational action programme on\ndemand reduction. We from the European Union fully\nsupport an effective and rapid follow-up and\nimplementation programme of the outcome of the special\nsession.\nIn the light of the important new and extensive\nmandates in the field of international drug control, the\ndonor base of UNDCP must be broadened. The European\nUnion will continue to support the valuable work of\nUNDCP, the international lead agency in the follow-up to\nthe special session.\nThe fight against organized crime \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the work\nof the United Nations Centre for International Crime\nPrevention \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is of foremost importance. In this context\n11\n\n\nwe welcome closer cooperation between UNDCP and the\nCrime Prevention Centre in order to enhance the synergy of\nthese programmes. The danger which transnational\norganized crime poses to the world community by creeping\ninto many aspects of our societies must be met by effective\ninternational measures. Therefore, we support the\nelaboration of a convention against transnational organized\ncrime and are pleased about the constructive and productive\nspirit of the preparatory meeting in Buenos Aires.\nThe horrible bomb attacks in Africa and Northern\nIreland have brought terrorism back to the forefront of\ninternational concern. The General Assembly, setting norms\nand standards for the fight against terrorism, has passed a\nnumber of resolutions and adopted no fewer than 11 anti-\nterrorism conventions. The Sixth Committee is currently\nnegotiating a convention on the suppression of acts of\nnuclear terrorism. Its early finalization would signal the\ndetermination of the international community to relentlessly\npursue terrorists. Only through concerted action can we win\nthe battle against terrorists. The more countries join in this\neffort, the fewer the safe havens where terrorists can run or\nhide.\nThe successful completion of the Conference for the\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court is an\nachievement of historic dimensions. The European Union\nfully endorses the outcome of the Rome Conference and the\nStatute, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority\nof participating States. This Statute lays the foundation for\nan effective and credible Court as an institution to fight\nimpunity for the most heinous crimes and to deter, once\nand for all, their commission, thereby contributing to the\nglobal advancement of peace and democracy. This session\nof the General Assembly must adopt the appropriate\ndecisions to make the Court a reality. The European Union\nstands ready to do its utmost to contribute to the\naccomplishment of these tasks.\nAs in the past, the European Union describes its\nrelations with third countries, and its position on areas of\nconflict throughout the world, in a memorandum that is\ncirculated as an integral part of this address. The\nmemorandum is a useful compendium of the common\nforeign and security policy of the Union and of relevant\nCommunity policies. I will highlight just a few positions.\nWe are extremely concerned at the dramatic escalation\nof tension in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have been killed,\nmore than 250,000 refugees have been forced to leave their\nhomes as a result of armed clashes, and the threat of a\nhumanitarian catastrophe is becoming ever more real. The\nprimary responsibility for the devastating situation rests\nwith the Serb and Yugoslav authorities, since their police\nand military operations have led to consequences for the\ncivilian population that are out of any justifiable\nproportion. Therefore, it is up to President Slobodan\nMilosevic to order a halt to all repressive actions against\nthe civilian population in Kosovo. At the same time, the\nUnion expects that all parties concerned reject all forms\nof violence.\nThe Union, together with humanitarian organizations,\nhas started a series of projects in order to create\nfavourable conditions for a return process for refugees\nbefore the winter comes. A complete cessation of armed\nactivities and a progressive withdrawal of Serb forces is\nneeded now to make people confident enough to return to\ntheir homes. The European Union urges the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia authorities to allow unimpeded\naccess to all areas of Kosovo for humanitarian\norganizations and observers and international forensic\nexperts.\nNegotiations between both sides, with international\ninvolvement, should take place as soon as possible to\nagree upon confidence-building measures and to define a\nnew status for Kosovo. However, without a cessation of\nthe ongoing Serb offensive, an end to further bloodshed\nand a significant improvement of the catastrophic\nhumanitarian situation, a meaningful dialogue cannot be\nstarted. The European Union hopes that progress towards\ndemocracy, which is a prerequisite for the resolution of\nthe conflict, can be achieved in the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia. The final objective of the reform process\nshould be the full integration of the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia into the international community.\nThe Union remains fully committed to the\nimplementation of the Dayton Accords, to political and\neconomic stabilization, the return of refugees and the\nstrengthening of civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe past year has seen substantial progress due to strong\npressure by the international community. We hope that\nthe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina will\ncontribute to the reconciliation of the ethnic communities\nand to the construction of a new civil society.\nWith regard to Albania, the European Union is\nseriously concerned at the recent outbreak of violence\nfollowing the assassination of a leading politician of an\nopposition party. The European Union calls on all\nAlbanian political parties to adopt a constructive attitude\nto solving the crisis by peaceful means through political\nconsultations. It urges the parties to renounce any strategy\nof confrontation and to avoid fighting and violent\n12\n\n\ndemonstrations. Further violence will make national\nreconciliation even more difficult.\nWe sincerely hope that the instability still widespread\nin Albania will soon be overcome, in particular by\novercoming the current political difficulties caused by\nhatred, mutual mistrust and various actions by both the\nGovernment and the main opposition party. The Union\nreminds all political factions of their obligation not to\ndeepen the political divide, but rather to develop a spirit of\ncooperation.\nThe Union will continue its assistance according to\nprogress made in the political dialogue as well as in the\nstabilization of institutions, especially in the field of police\naction.\nThe European Union stresses once again that the status\nquo in Cyprus is not acceptable. It reaffirms its strong\nsupport for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his\nSpecial Representative aimed at a negotiated and lasting\nsolution to the Cyprus question, respecting the sovereignty,\nindependence, territorial integrity and unity of the country\nin accordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, with the goal of a bizonal, bicommunal\nfederation on Cyprus.\nThe Union started accession negotiations with the\nRepublic of Cyprus on 31 March of this year. The\naccession process and progress towards a political solution\nshould reinforce one another. Accession to the Union\nshould benefit all communities and help to bring about\npeace and reconciliation on the island.\nIn this context, we welcome the appointment of the\nnew United Nations Deputy Special Representative, Dame\nAnn Hercus.\nThe European Union remains deeply concerned at the\ncontinuing standstill in the Middle East peace process,\nwhich constitutes a threat to the stability of the region. The\nUnion considers the Middle East peace process to be the\nonly path to security and peace for Israel, the Palestinians\nand the neighbouring States. A just and durable solution is\nin the fundamental interest of the European Union.\nOur approach was reaffirmed at the meeting of the\nEuropean Council held in Cardiff in June 1998. We\ncontribute actively to efforts to promote the peace process,\nproviding not only substantial economic support but also\nadding our political weight to the search for a solution. It\nis of the utmost importance to restore trust and confidence\nbetween the parties. The pillars of a solution continue to be\nin the principles agreed at Madrid and Oslo, especially\nland for peace, the full implementation of existing\ncommitments of the Israeli/Palestinian Interim Agreement\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe call on Israel to recognize the right of the\nPalestinians to self-determination without excluding the\noption of a state of their own. On the other side, we call\nupon the Palestinians to reaffirm their commitment to\nIsrael\u00e2s right to live within recognized and safe borders.\nWe also reiterate our opposition to Israeli settlements in\noccupied Arab territories and to other unilateral measures,\nsuch as the changing of the status of Jerusalem. More\nthan any other issues, such acts, as well as the continued\nexpansion of settlements, undermine the Palestinians\u00e2\nconfidence in the peace process.\nThe European Union will continue to provide\nassistance to the Palestinian people. The positive\ndevelopment of the Palestinian economy is a precondition\nfor political stability.\nWe want to express our concern at the lack of\nprogress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and we\nunderline the need for a continuing effort in order to\nachieve a solution.\nThe Union supports the efforts of the United States\nto relaunch the negotiations. We consider that every\navenue should be explored in order to restore a spirit of\nmutual trust and constructive negotiations. In this respect,\nwe think that the recent proposals put forward by France\nand Egypt, as well as by our European Union Special\nEnvoy, should be studied positively.\nAfrica, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, stands at the\ncrossroads once more. In his landmark report (A/52/871)\nentitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The causes of conflict and the promotion of\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan provided us with a clear\nanalysis and a framework for a comprehensive policy.\nThe European Union is deeply concerned about the\nterrible toll that recent and current conflicts have taken,\nespecially on innocent civilians. In spite of important\nregional and subregional efforts, the instability appears to\nbe spreading, and creating a downward spiral that simply\nhas to be stopped. I therefore urge the international\ncommunity to continue to complement African efforts to\nsolve their problems, as it has done by establishing the\nUnited Nations Mission in the Central African Republic\n(MINURCA) and the United Nations Observer Mission in\nSierra Leone (UNOMSIL). The Union would welcome\nfurther development of regional and subregional\n13\n\n\ncooperation and integration among African countries. We\nhope that the summit between the European Union and the\nSouthern African Development Community in Vienna in\nNovember will make an important contribution.\nThe Secretary-General\u00e2s report rightly focuses on the\nimportance of creating an environment in which durable\npeace is sustained and economic growth promoted.\nRecognizing that peace and security are indispensable\npreconditions, we emphasize the need for good governance,\nincluding respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nThese values are essential pillars of the European Union\u00e2s\ndevelopment policy, which over several decades has been\ncentred on a genuine partnership with Africa.\nThe European Union is particularly concerned about\nthe ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand the wider dangers for the region as a whole from the\nescalation of the conflict. In this respect, we hope that the\nEuropean Union Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region,\nMr. Aldo Ajello, will continue to work together with the\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations.\nWe urge all the parties involved in the conflict of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to respect human rights\nand humanitarian law and to abstain from acts of violence\nagainst civilians. We welcome African initiatives to find a\npeaceful solution to this conflict, which can be solved only\nthrough a negotiated settlement acceptable to all Congolese.\nThis would allow the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand other countries of the region to find the peace and\nstability that are prerequisites for their development. The\nUnion remains ready to help this political dialogue and to\nsupport any negotiation scheme obtaining the consent of all\nparties involved, inter alia, through the assistance of our\nSpecial Envoy for the Great Lakes region. A regional\nconference could be useful at a later stage to consider the\nrelevant aspects and to strengthen regional cooperation.\nWe are determined to play an effective role in efforts\nto stop the fighting and restore peace, stability and respect\nfor human rights in Afghanistan. We are committed to\nbringing about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan, putting\nan end to foreign intervention, and encouraging intra-\nAfghan dialogue, in particular through support for the\ncentral role of the United Nations. The European Union\nattaches special importance to the fight against illegal drugs\nand terrorism in Afghanistan.\nWe remain gravely concerned at the persistent human\nrights violations and breaches of humanitarian law in\nAfghanistan. We denounce the continuing discrimination\nagainst girls and women in that country. We strongly urge\nall factions, and in particular the Taliban, to recognize,\nprotect and promote human rights. And we strongly urge\nthem to end discriminatory policies and to recognize,\nprotect and promote equal rights and dignity for men and\nwomen.\nNon-governmental organizations will be able to\nreturn to Kabul only when the authorities in Afghanistan\nhave met the necessary conditions.\nWe reiterate our strong concern for the security of\nUnited Nations personnel, other related personnel and\npersonnel of non-governmental organizations in\nAfghanistan, and we recall the responsibility of all\nfactions to ensure safety, security and freedom of\nmovement. We condemn the recent attack against two\nstaff members of the United Nations Special Mission to\nAfghanistan (UNSMA) and the killing of Iranian\ndiplomats in northern Afghanistan, and we demand an\nurgent investigation into these atrocious acts. We call on\nthe Taliban to cooperate fully in ensuring the safe release\nof the remaining diplomats and other Iranian nationals\nmissing in Afghanistan.\nWe have been deeply involved in the electoral\nprocess in Cambodia, especially in voter registration and\npoll observation, dispatching some 200 election observers\nwho cooperated exceptionally well with the United\nNations and other observer groups in the Joint\nInternational Observer Group.\nWe call upon all political forces in Cambodia to\nseize this opportunity to work together, to the fullest\nextent possible, towards national reconciliation, and\nexpress the hope that, with the elections, the foundation\nfor the future well-being and prosperity of the people of\nCambodia has been laid. Return to political normalcy will\nencourage the Union to consider new assistance\nprogrammes to help Cambodia in its economic recovery.\nThe Union notes with satisfaction the results\nachieved at the August meeting in New York, under the\nauspices of Mr. Kofi Annan, between the Foreign\nMinisters of Indonesia and Portugal on the question of\nEast Timor. We commend the Secretary-General and his\nPersonal Representative for their efforts in this regard.\nWe welcome the Ministers\u00e2 agreement to enter into\nin-depth negotiations on issues related to the question of\nEast Timor, addressed in the final communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 of the\nmeeting, without prejudice to their basic positions of\nprinciple. We hope that these negotiations will lead to a\n14\n\n\njust, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution\nin the near future, respecting the rights and legitimate\naspirations of the people, in accordance with the resolutions\nof the General Assembly and with the principles enshrined\nin the United Nations Charter. We welcome the prospect of\nthe closer involvement of the East Timorese in the search\nfor a solution.\nI am deeply concerned at the continuing violations of\nhuman rights and lack of progress towards democracy in\nBurma/Myanmar. We strongly deplore the repressive\nactions of the Burmese authorities, including the arrest of\nseveral hundred members of the opposition. We call upon\nthe State Peace and Development Council once again to\nbring human rights violations to an end and to enter into a\nsubstantive dialogue with opposition leaders, especially and\nincluding Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of\nethnic minorities, in order to establish democratic rule in\naccordance with the will of the people as expressed in\ndemocratic elections held in 1990. The Union seeks to\ncooperate closely with other countries, in particular in the\nregion, to resolve the worrying situation in the country.\nAlthough the challenges of the twenty-first century\nwill be different from those we have been used to dealing\nwith in past decades, we are convinced that the United\nNations will become more indispensable than ever as the\nforum for global cooperation. What we have to do now is\nto make our world Organization fit for the next century.\nThe Secretary-General\u00e2s reform programme is excellent.\nThe reform of our world Organization is in the interest\nof all Member States. Of course, reform is not a cost-\ncutting exercise alone, but an ongoing process which will\nultimately lead to a substantial improvement of the work\ndone in the United Nations family. This process will help\nthe Organization to better focus on the fulfilment of\nmandates and on the improvement of programme delivery.\nConsequently, the European Union will continue vigorously\nto support reform based on the proposals of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the decisions of the General Assembly.\nAs far as the organization and methods of work of\nintergovernmental bodies are concerned, and especially of\nthe General Assembly, we attach particular importance to\nthe implementation of the reforms already agreed upon. We\nwould welcome further improvements, particularly the\nstreamlining of agendas, the reduction of duplication and\nbetter coordination between bodies dealing with similar\nissues.\nThe European Union firmly believes that the General\nAssembly should concentrate on implementing the\nsignificant agreements reached in some working groups of\nthe General Assembly and at the major United Nations\nconferences. Carefully wrought compromises that allowed\nadoption by consensus were the result of a great amount\nof time and energy invested by all Member States.\nThe European Union is firmly committed to finding\nsolutions to the United Nations financial crisis.\nContinuing high levels of unpaid assessments are\nundermining the financial stability and liquidity, and\ntherefore the purpose and goal, of the United Nations.\nThis places a heavy and unfair burden upon troop-\ncontributing countries. The member States of the\nEuropean Union have consistently honoured their\nfinancial obligations towards the United Nations. They\npay their contributions in full, on time and without\nconditions. A sound financial basis requires that all\nMember States fulfil their Charter obligations. The United\nStates cannot be exempt from such obligations.\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, the\nUnited States has a special responsibility towards the\nUnited Nations. We express our sincere hope that\nWashington will soon settle its arrears and live up to the\nlegitimate expectations of Member States of the United\nStates\u00e2 role in the world Organization.\nThe European Union has grown from 100 million\npeople to 400 million today. With only 8 per cent of the\nworld population, the Union provides for 60 per cent of\ndevelopment and 50 per cent of humanitarian assistance.\nEighty per cent of international aid to Russia and the\nrepublics of the former Soviet Union, and 50 per cent of\nthe assistance to the Palestinian territories are paid by the\nEuropean Union. Forty per cent of the reconstruction help\nto Bosnia and Herzegovina come from the member States\nof the European Union. We are the strongest supporter of\nthe United Nations. Our contributions account for 36 per\ncent of the regular budget and 39 per cent of the\npeacekeeping budget. The Union is ready to use its\npolitical weight for the benefit of the entire international\ncommunity, in particular developing countries.\nLet me conclude by reaffirming the European\nUnion\u00e2s deep commitment to the purposes and principles\nof the United Nations Charter. We will continue to\nsupport strongly the United Nations and the Secretary-\nGeneral in carrying out the key objectives: the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, economic\nand social progress, and the promotion of human rights\nand democratic freedoms.\n15\n\n\nThe message of the European Union to the United\nNations is clear. At the threshold of the new millennium,\nwe face common threats and challenges. We must join\nforces to harness the benefits and diminish the risks of\nglobalization. We must form a global alliance for human\nsecurity. Global cooperation, as understood by the European\nUnion, means human solidarity to ensure the survival of our\nplanet and safeguard the future of coming generations.\n\n\n"

I have no doubt that your\ndiplomatic experience and proven leadership will guide us\nsuccessfully in our work.\nAllow me also to thank your predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the determined\nleadership with which he steered the work of the fifty-\nsecond session.\nThe United Nations, being the primary vehicle for\nthe pursuit of world peace, has striven throughout its\nexistence to make the world a better place to live in.\nDespite adversities of all kinds, caused particularly by\nopposing national interests, violent conflicts, natural\ndisasters and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, the United Nations has pursued consistently\nthe noble goals enshrined in its Charter, first and foremost\nthe elimination of the scourge of war and the achievement\nof economic development.\nTo be realistic, however, the hopes of mankind for\na new and genuinely just international legal and political\norder, generated by the demise of the bipolar world, are\nyet to be realized.\nCyprus reaffirms its commitment to work closely\nwith the other members of the Organization for the\nattainment of our common goals. We support, therefore,\nthe reform efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\n3\n\n\nAnnan, to streamline the operations of the Organization in\na way that assures its ability to pursue its goals, meet new\nchallenges and safeguard its financial position. We stress\nonce more the importance of restructuring the Security\nCouncil to make it more representative and transparent.\nCyprus welcomes the adoption of the Statute of a\npermanent International Criminal Court, empowering it to\nbring to justice the perpetrators of most serious crimes and\nviolations of humanitarian law. In this respect, we consider\nthe first-ever judgement by the international criminal court\nfor Rwanda on the crime of genocide a very important step.\nOf special concern is the rising number of refugees\nand internally displaced persons. Their plight calls not only\nfor international cooperation in providing protection and\nhumanitarian assistance, but also for addressing the root\ncauses of displacement. We continue to believe that the best\nsolution is the return of refugees to their homes in\nconditions of safety, with full protection of their human\nrights.\nCyprus condemns terrorism, which it considers a\nmenace to humanity, requiring effective international action\nand solutions on the basis of international law and the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be\ncharacterized by lack of progress and obstacles to the\nimplementation of the peace accords. The current stalemate\nposes a threat to the stability of the region. Cyprus, a\nneighbouring State with close relations to the parties\ninvolved, reiterates its support for the achievement of a just,\nlasting and comprehensive settlement based on the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions.\nI would like to reiterate my country?s support for the\ndocuments adopted at the General Assembly special session\non the world drug problem and for the relevant efforts of\nthe United Nations.\nCyprus welcomes the recent report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the situation in Africa. His recommendations\nmerit serious consideration and support by the international\ncommunity. We believe that the international community\nshould redouble its efforts towards assisting African\ncountries, with special attention given to debt relief, so that\nthey can avoid further instability and the danger of\nmarginalization.\nCyprus joined in the worldwide rejoicing over the\nagreement of last April concerning Northern Ireland. It is\nimportant for the sides to honour their responsibilities and\nmeet their commitments. We condemn acts of violence,\nwhich should not be allowed to block the road to peace,\nreconciliation and prosperity.\nCyprus supports strongly the efforts in the area of\narms control and disarmament. Since my last appearance\nbefore this body, we have ratified the Chemical Weapons\nConvention; we have also signed, and will soon ratify, the\nConvention on anti-personnel mines. I should emphasize\nin this respect that, in spite of the difficult situation we\nface because of the presence of an occupation army force\nof 36,000 troops, Cyprus has decided to sign the\nConvention as an expression of our determination to join\nthe forces struggling to eliminate this utterly cruel method\nof war. We are grateful to Canada for promising to\nfinance the undertaking to clear the minefields along the\nceasefire line in our country.\nThe United Nations has a special role to play in the\npromotion of the well-being of small States. Small States\nare often exposed to a much greater degree than larger\nStates to threats because of increased vulnerability of their\nenvironment and security.\nIn this connection, Cyprus has suffered for more\nthan 24 years the grave consequences of the Turkish\ninvasion and the continuing occupation of more than one\nthird of its territory. Despite the pronounced will of the\ninternational community through numerous resolutions\nand the willingness of the Greek Cypriot side to negotiate\nin good faith, no solution of the Cyprus problem has\nresulted. It is, therefore, reasonable to ask why. The\nanswer is: It is because of the non-implementation and\nflagrant violation of Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions by Turkey.\nI feel that it is necessary to give some examples of\nthese flagrant violations which prevented solution of the\nCyprus problem. Security Council and General Assembly\nresolutions calling for respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and non-\nrecognition of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway entity were\nviolated by Turkey, which is the only State which\nrecognized the Turkish Cypriot secessionist entity, and\nwhich sustains it financially and militarily.\nAs regards Security Council and General Assembly\nresolutions, calling for the speedy withdrawal of all\nforeign armed forces and personnel from the Republic of\nCyprus, not only have the Turkish armed forces and\npersonnel not been withdrawn, but they have been\n4\n\n\nincreased and upgraded, to such an extent that the previous\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, described in\nhis report to the Security Council the occupied area of\nCyprus as one of the most militarized areas in the world.\nUnited Nations resolutions for the return of the\nrefugees to their homes under conditions of safety were not\nimplemented, not only because Turkish forces prevented the\nrefugees from returning, but also because Turkey, violating\nother provisions of United Nations resolutions calling on all\nparties concerned to avoid any action to change the\ndemographic composition of the population of Cyprus,\nimported to Cyprus thousands of illegal settlers from\nTurkey, usurped the properties of the refugees and installed\nsettlers in them. I could go on giving examples of gross\nviolations of United Nations resolutions by Turkey, but in\norder to confine myself to the time limits allowed, I will\nrefer only to the latest violation.\nThe recent demand of the Turkish Cypriot leader,\nMr. Denktas, in the presence of the Turkish Foreign\nMinister, violates all United Nations resolutions, which call\nfor a bizonal-bicommunal federation, with a single\nsovereignty, international personality and citizenship, and is\naimed at derailing the negotiating process from the base of\nthe United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, and also at\nextinguishing the independence of the Republic of Cyprus\nand creating, under the guise of a Turkish Cypriot\nRepublic, a Turkish colony in Cyprus or, to say the least,\na Turkish protectorate.\nThe non-implementation of United Nations resolutions\non Cyprus tarnishes the image of the United Nations and its\nmain bodies. The former Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, in one of his reports to the Security Council,\nidentified as a cause of the absence of progress in Cyprus\nthe lack of political will on the part of the Turkish side.\nWith that report the diagnosis of the causes of the\nfailure to make progress towards a solution is completed. Is\nit too much for the people of Cyprus to ask what the next\nstep will be? Will the United Nations finally take the\nnecessary action to apply the required remedy in order to\nput an end to the tragedy that has befallen our small State\nand that has continued for 24 years?\nThe international community should not allow one\nState to violate for so long its expressed will. The Security\nCouncil, the main organ for international peace and\nsecurity, should proceed to examine how to implement its\nresolutions as soon as possible.\nI now want to address the problem of Cyprus, not by\nlooking at the past, but by outlining my goals for the\nfuture. The Cyprus problem has been with us for over 40\nyears. Today, the two communities of Cyprus are led by\nthe generation that was involved in the earliest stages of\nthe Cyprus problem. This generation knows both the joys\nof friendships that crossed communal lines and the\ntragedies and suffering that also crossed communal lines.\nRauf Denktas\u00b8 and I are both members of this\ngeneration, which has seen the best and the worst of the\nrecent history of Cyprus. Our communities have entrusted\nus with their respective leaderships. The people of\nCyprus, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, look\nto us, their leaders, to help shape a future that is better\nthan the present and that will not allow for a repetition of\nthe past.\nLet me offer my vision for the future. I want all\nCypriots to have security in their homes and their\ncommunities; I want all Cypriots to pursue their\nlivelihoods free of economic restrictions and the fear of\ninstability; I want all Cypriot children to know their\ndistinct cultural and religious heritage and to be able to\ncarry their identity and political rights into the future\nwithout fear of domination from any quarter.\nThe solution to any constitutional problem on the\nbasis of communal or ethnic criteria and federalism\ncontains elements of partnership and political equality of\nthe constituent parts.\nThe solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of\na bicommunal-bizonal federation requires such a\npartnership of the two communities as would\nconstitutionally provide for a maximum degree of internal\nself-administration for the two constituent cantons,\nprovinces or States, and, adhering to the principle of the\nequal political status of the constituent parts, it must\nprovide them with the same rights, powers and functions\nregarding their respective separate, internal self-\nadministration. The constitution must also provide for\neffective participation of the constituent parts in the\nfederal government. It must also secure all fundamental\nhuman rights and freedoms for all the citizens of the\nfederation. Above all, it must safeguard the single\nsovereignty, the indivisibility and the unity of the\nbicommunal-bizonal federation. Such a federation,\nbecoming a member of the European Union, will thrive\nat home and abroad.\n5\n\n\nOne of the questions we should ask when looking at\nvarious ideas for a solution is: Do they reasonably meet the\nneeds of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, and\nwill they promote stability and encourage cooperation and\npartnership among the people of Cyprus?\nIt is obvious that a bicommunal solution must be\nnegotiated, not only because all United Nations resolutions\nso demand, but also because only in negotiations can we\nwork out the practical steps needed to realize a functioning\nsolution.\nSecurity for both communities is a fundamental part of\nany settlement; this will require arrangements special to\nCyprus. To be effective, an agreement to this end must\nproduce a settlement that can meet the real life challenges\ninherent to a small island State.\nI believe that the gap between what ordinary Turkish\nCypriots and Greek Cypriots want and need in a settlement\nis not so great as it might appear. Both want the same\nthings: peace, prosperity, stability and physical, political,\neconomic and cultural security, including respect for and\nenjoyment of their homes and properties.\nI am confident that, working together under the\numbrella of the United Nations and with the help of the\ninternational community, Greek Cypriots and Turkish\nCypriots can construct a settlement that meets these needs\nand removes the fears and insecurities that have plagued\nCyprus since the middle part of this century. To do this, we\nmust begin serious negotiations.\nI believe that we, the current generation of leadership,\nmust negotiate a settlement to our decades-old problem that\nwill give all the people of Cyprus a future that will ensure\nthat the bitter experiences of the past cannot and shall not\nbe repeated. We, the older generation of both communities,\nmust close this sad chapter of Cyprus?s history with an\nagreement between us which will allow generations to come\nto build and realize the fruits of true partnership, based on\nmutual respect and political understanding.\nWhile we cannot reconcile ourselves with the Turkish\ninvasion and occupation, we are genuinely determined to\nrenew and invigorate bicommunal confidence and trust,\ncooperation and interaction with our Turkish Cypriot\ncompatriots. In my investiture speech last February, I\nextended a hand of friendship and urged the Turkish\nCypriot leader, Mr. Denktas, to join me in working together\ntowards finding a solution to the tragic problem of Cyprus\nfor the benefit of all the citizens of the island. Similarly, I\ninvited the Turkish Cypriots to participate as full\nmembers in the Cypriot delegation negotiating the\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union, thus shaping\ntogether our positions and common destiny.\nToday, before the representatives of the international\ncommunity and from the podium of this Assembly,\nadhering to the will of the international community for an\nagreed solution to the Cyprus problem within the\nparameters set forth in United Nations resolutions, as\nleader of the Greek Cypriot community, I renew my\ninvitation to the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,\nMr. Rauf Denktas, to work together for the solution of the\nCyprus problem in order to build a happy and prosperous\nisland for our children and future generations. The\ninterests of Cyprus lie in the unity and interaction of the\ntwo communities. The continuing tension prevents Cyprus\nand its people from assuming their rightful role and\nmaking their contribution to regional stability and the\nimprovement of Greco-Turkish relations.\nThe Government of Cyprus is committed to a\npeaceful solution, on the basis of the United Nations\nresolutions, which will safeguard the interests and the\nhuman rights of all its citizens.\nWe have consistently put forward proposals for the\nreduction of tension on the island.\nTension in Cyprus escalates because of the massive\npresence of the Turkish occupation forces in the north,\ntheir continuous strengthening and upgrading, and the\ncorresponding need the Government of the Republic feels\nto strengthen its defences.\nThe Security Council, recognizing that the increase\nin tension is due to the build-up of military forces, has\ncalled in a number of its resolutions for the reduction of\nforces and armaments.\nWhile the Government of the Republic of Cyprus\nwill continue to exercise its sovereign right to strengthen\nits defences with whatever means it considers necessary\nfor as long as Turkish occupation forces remain in\nCyprus, I have not failed, in response to Security Council\nresolutions, to suggest concrete ways and measures to\nwork for a specific programme of reduction of foreign\nand local forces and equipment as a necessary preparatory\nstep for the programmed and final withdrawal of all\nforeign forces and other elements and for the\ndemilitarization of Cyprus. These proposals and\nsuggestions, on our part, are still valid and timely, and as\n6\n\n\nsuch they remain on the negotiating table. We remain\ncommitted to a solution to the problem by peaceful means,\nand for this a lessening of tension is a necessary ingredient.\nIn the face of continuous threats against Cyprus by the\nvastly superior military might of Turkey, whose ultimate\naim is to keep the island a perpetual hostage, to destroy its\nsovereignty and to reduce it to a Turkish protectorate, the\nstrong, principled support of United Nations Members is of\nparamount importance.\nAt this point, I wish to thank the Foreign Ministers of\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council and\nthe Secretary-General for discussing the Cyprus problem on\n24 September 1998 and for issuing a statement calling for\nan early resumption of a sustained process of direct\nnegotiations between the two communities, reminding them\nat the same time of the need to achieve a comprehensive\npolitical settlement in accordance with Security Council\nresolutions and to avoid any actions which might increase\ntension.\nI reply \u201cYes\u201d to the resumption of a sustained process\nof direct negotiations on the basis of Security Council\nresolutions; I reply \u201cYes\u201d to avoiding any action that might\nincrease tension and thus jeopardize progress in the\nnegotiating process.\nWe trust that we can rely once again on the active\nsolidarity of Members at this crucial juncture, as the most\nsacred principles of the United Nations Charter and the\ncredibility of the world public order itself come into focus\nin this respect.\nAs we approach the new millennium, the leaders of\nthe world must decide what kind of world we want our\nchildren and grandchildren to live in. Is it a world of sheer\ninterests and lack of principles, where cold calculations of\neconomic and strategic interests are pre-eminent, or a world\ngoverned by justice and respect for human rights, which is\nthe only solution for permanent peace and stability in the\nworld?"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me to convey to you, Sir, the\nsatisfaction of the delegation of Congo at seeing you\nconducting our work. Your unanimous election to the\npresidency of the fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly not only denotes recognition by the\ninternational community of your great qualities as a\nstatesman and experienced diplomat, but also attests to the\nimportant role played by your country, Uruguay, in the\nmaintenance of peace in the world.\n12\n\n\nMr. President, I wish to convey to you and to the\nother members of the Bureau our heartfelt, sincere\ncongratulations and to assure you of the full cooperation of\nthe delegation of Congo. I should like also to pay well-\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, for the competence and open-mindedness with\nwhich he conducted the work of the previous session.\nFinally, I wish to express the appreciation of our\ndelegation to the Secretary-General of our Organization,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, in a world where violence, injustice\nand frustration predominate, has been tirelessly striving to\nassert the virtues of dialogue and tolerance and to promote\npeace and development. Peace and development: these two\nideals have for decades posed a major challenge to the\ninternational community.\nIt is very difficult to take the floor after all of the\noutstanding and talented speakers who have spoken from\nthis rostrum. What more could I add to all of the points so\neloquently made about Africa and the rest of the world?\nFor more than a decade now, Africa has made the\nheadlines only as the result of crises and conflicts: civil\nwars, inter-State wars, drought, famine and epidemics. All\nof these obstacles so impede the development of our\ncontinent that we cannot but wonder whether Africa will be\nentering the third millennium on the wrong foot.\nUnfortunately, Congo, my country, is an example of\nthis. A year ago, Congo had been in the throes of a civil\nwar for five long months. The international community and\nour Organization in particular strove hard to find a\nnegotiated solution to the conflict. We wish to pay tribute\nto the commendable efforts made by the Secretary-General\njointly with a numerous African heads of State.\nUnfortunately, we all know that these efforts were\nunsuccessful.\nWe are convinced that respect for the state of law and\ngood governance remain, in a sound economic environment,\na prerequisite for the well-being of our peoples. And it is\nbecause they did not understand this point that the former\nruling class imposed on the peaceful citizens of my country\ntwo civil wars in the space of five years, the latest of\nwhich \u2014 that of 1997 \u2014 was the most deadly and the most\ndevastating.\nWe do not intend to dwell on the many ways the\nformer regime violated the rules of democracy, even if this\nwould be helpful in understanding the causes of the tragic\nevents that my country has experienced.\nToday the war is over. Congo is resolutely looking\nto the future. The future means national reconciliation; it\nmeans rebuilding our devastated country; it means\nresuming the democratic process.\nFrom 5 to 14 January last, a national forum was held\nat Brazzaville to study practical modalities to attain these\ngoals. That forum, which brought together more than\n1,400 participants representing all segments of Congolese\nsociety, established a transitional Parliament and set the\nduration for this transitional period at three years.\nThe Government of National Unity and Public\nSalvation is now concentrating on the following priorities:\nthe reconciliation of all the sons and daughters of the\ncountry; the rehabilitation of our infrastructure; the\nrestoration of State administration; the resumption of the\ndemocratic process \u2014 census-taking started again last\nAugust; the reorganization of our national economy with,\ninter alia, the privatization of the major State companies;\nand the resumption of negotiations with international\nfinancial institutions, which concluded in June this year\nwith the adoption of a post-conflict programme.\nToday, in the light of the results obtained, we can\nstate that the transitional timetable will be respected.\nThese encouraging results have yet to be\nconsolidated, and our country is still fragile because of\nthe turmoil in the subregion.\nThe events taking place in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo cause great concern to my country, since\nour stability largely depends on that of our neighbours. I\ntherefore want to reaffirm the Congolese Government?s\ncommitment to respect the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our\ncountry will never serve as a base of operations for the\ndestabilization of this fraternal country.\nUnderstanding the costs of civil war and anxious to\ncontribute to finding a political solution to this crisis,\nCongo (Brazzaville) has been working with its various\ncontacts among all the States of the subregion. This was\nthe case in Durban during the summit of the Non-Aligned\nCountries, when President Denis Sassou Nguesso met\nmost of his counterparts, and more recently in Libreville,\nat the summit of Central African heads of State.\nOur country intends to honour its commitments\nunder the relevant provisions of Conventions of the\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations\n13\n\n\nrelating to refugees and displaced persons. Therefore, I\nmust solemnly repudiate the false allegations by certain\nmedia of a supposed agreement between the Governments\nof the two Congos to transfer displaced Rwandans located\nin Congo (Brazzaville) to Congo (Kinshasa) so that they\ncan participate in the war. The displaced Rwandans living\nin Congo (Brazzaville) are in fact under the control of the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, and any movement of them is taking place\nwithout the support of our Government, which wishes to\ninform the international community that it refuses to accept\nany responsibility for the consequences.\nIn Angola the hopes aroused by the Lusaka Protocol\nhave been continually dashed by the bad faith and sudden\nreversals of position of Mr. Jonas Savimbi, who is thereby\ntaking a whole segment of the Angolan people hostage,\ndenying them the opportunity to pursue development tasks.\nMy country firmly supports the Angolan Government in its\nefforts to achieve lasting peace in the country and to\nfinalize rapidly and completely the implementation of the\nLusaka Accords. My country completely supports the\ndecision adopted by the Southern African Development\nCommunity heads of State or Government in Mauritius,\ndescribing Mr. Jonas Savimbi as the person solely\nresponsible for the deterioration of the situation in Angola\nand calling upon other States to refrain from providing any\nsupport for Mr. Jonas Savimbi and his militarist wing.\nI would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to the\nmemory of Alioune Blondin Beye, a worthy son of Africa,\nwho gave the best of himself, including making the\nsupreme sacrifice, in the search for peace in Angola.\nAs regards other hot spots, the Congo always\nadvocates negotiated solutions. Therefore, we welcome the\nceasefire in Guinea-Bissau, and we hope that it will be used\nto work out a final solution to that conflict.\nThe same goes for the conflict between Ethiopia and\nEritrea; in this regard, we support the efforts of the\nOrganization of African Unity mediation committee.\nWe cannot overlook the crises and tensions prevailing\nin other parts of the world, notably in the Middle East,\nwhere the peace process relaunched by the Oslo Accords is\nnow stalled, but also in South Asia, where the recent\nnuclear tests conducted by India and then Pakistan have\nheightened the already high level of tension.\nThe establishment of just and lasting peace in the\nworld requires full recognition of the destabilizing factors\nas well as of the real solutions to development problems.\nOne only needs recall the extent to which peace and\ndevelopment are linked.\nIn the light of the changes in the world, and after\nmore than half a century of existence, the United Nations\nseems to be gradually and dangerously moving away from\nthe vision of its founding fathers. Solidarity seems to be\ngiving way to a selfishness that has no time for\nsolidarity. This new trend is making increasingly\ndifficult the management of economic questions, which\nhave already been the subject of much thought, without\nproducing any prospect of an improvement in the living\nstandards of the peoples of most of our States.\nViolence, famine, disease and poverty continue to\nafflict our peoples. The underlying causes of these\nscourges are constantly the subject of a multitude of\nstudies and various economic stimulation and\ndevelopment programmes, but without result, because of\na lack of real commitment by the international\ncommunity. The Agenda for Development, the\ninternational strategy for the development of Africa, the\nSecretary-General?s System-wide Special Initiative on\nAfrica \u2014 to cite merely those examples \u2014 are just so\nmany plans that no longer give reason for optimism.\nToday globalization is supposed to be the panacea.\nThis at least is the philosophy of worldwide liberalization.\nBut how can we be confident when the export\nopportunities for the developing countries are often\nneutralized by protectionism in a new guise, which uses\nvarious pretexts \u2014 technical standards, environmental and\nsocial concerns, or even concerns about human rights?\nHow can we be confident when official development\nassistance continues to decline? How can we be sure\nwhen the weakest economies are bending beneath the\nburden of debt?\nWith regard to Africa, we believe that through\neconomic integration we can mitigate the undesirable\neffects of globalization. Through greater solidarity we can\nhope to meet the challenges we face.\nThis year the international community is\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It is very significant that\nthis anniversary coincides with the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which our Government\nconsiders to be a major step forward. We believe that this\nevent puts the finishing touch to the magnificent edifice\n14\n\n\nthat the founding fathers began constructing more than 50\nyears ago.\nBut today?s United Nations is not the same as the old\none. Where once there were only a few dozen Member\nStates, today there are 185. The problems of peace and\ndevelopment are not what they were in 1945. It is time to\nreview the management of our communal house. It is time\nto reform the Organization, including the Security Council.\nIt is time to democratize the Organization in order to better\nadapt it to the requirements of the coming millennium.\nI cannot conclude without expressing the compassion\nof the Congolese Government and those affected by the\ncalamity now afflicting the Caribbean and the southern\nUnited States as a result of hurricane Georges. This wanton\nunleashing of the forces of nature reminds us that we are\nall, large and small, in the same boat \u2014 our planet\nEarth \u2014 and that we must show solidarity to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His service to\nhis country and intergovernmental organizations at the\nhighest levels and his experience as a teacher, scholar and\npractitioner of international law, with extensive work in\neconomic development and trade, as well as crime\nprevention and the protection of children, demonstrate the\nunderstanding and patience required here.\nMy delegation applauds the achievements of\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session who time and again\ndemonstrated the dexterity and humour necessary for\nadvancing the delicate process of United Nations reform,\nwhich Solomon Islands wholeheartedly supports. In the\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who continues to nurture\nthat process, this Organization has found one of the great\nmen of our time. We are honoured by his presence.\nHaving often spoken strongly in favour of gender\nequality, my delegation rejoiced in the election of\nMs. Louise Frechette as the first Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral. She and the Secretary-General admirably\nrepresent the indispensable Secretariat.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, many developing\ncountries continue to experience difficult economic,\n\n\nenvironmental and social problems. The lack of capital\nresources, crushing debt, external economic shocks and the\nfall in development assistance retard the growth of the\neconomies of many least developed countries. The small\nisland developing States continue to experience growth in\ndrug and other transborder crimes. Moreover, our people\nface the ever present threat of natural disaster, such as the\ndevastating tsunami that recently struck Papua New Guinea,\nour nearby neighbour.\nWe are a village people feeling the impact of\nglobalization. The vulnerability of small island developing\nStates to external economic shock is indeed real. Our tiny\neconomy means a narrow human and non-human resources\nbase and a limited domestic market. We are dangerously\nexposed to external economic developments in trade, capital\nflows and technology. Limited in our capacity to stabilize\nour domestic economy, we are especially sensitive to and\ndependent on the international situation. Our inability to\neffectively deal with the impacts of the Asian financial\ncrisis demonstrates our vulnerability. The drop in my\ncountry\u2019s export revenue further undermines our difficult\nfinancial and economic situation. Well-designed and\ncarefully monitored international standards and codes of\nconduct for capital flows and private financial management\nare essential. Without such regulatory measures, the\nprospects that the least developed countries will benefit\nfrom globalization and trade liberalization remain bleak. We\nface even further marginalization.\nThe Alliance for Change Government of Solomon\nIslands is well aware that whether we and other least\ndeveloped countries succeed in effectively using the\nopportunities and mitigating the risks offered by the new\nworld trading system depends largely on our success in\nmaking major macroeconomic policy reforms and\novercoming deficiencies. To stimulate private sector\ninvolvement and the active participation of indigenous\nSolomon Islanders, the Government has launched a reform\nprogramme incorporating sound banking and financial\npractices conducive to economic growth and stability. The\npublic sector is being restructured to create more efficient,\nresponsive and accountable governmental administration.\nWe cannot succeed, however, without significant\nbilateral and multilateral assistance. The experience of other\neconomies that have undertaken similar programmes shows\nthat the reforms can be accelerated by assured markets for\ntraditional products as well as access to new markets and\ncapital. Moreover, multilateral agencies such as the United\nNations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) can\nassist significantly in enhancing competitiveness and\ncapacity-building.\nCommunications and information technology are, of\ncourse, essential for economic revitalization, especially so\nfor Solomon Islands and other small island developing\nStates remote from major markets and financial centres.\nMy Government is committed to the development of\nefficient and cost-effective telecommunication networks\nas a catalyst for economic and social progress. We are\nalso supporting long-distance education by radio and\ncampaigns to reduce and eliminate illiteracy.\nSustainable development and the scientific\nmanagement of our forest and marine resources remain\nhigh priority matters for my Government. The 922 islands\nand atolls of the Solomons stretch over 1.35 million\nsquare kilometres of ocean. Fisheries are essential for our\neconomy. Last April, Parliament enacted legislation to\ncontrol the exploitation of our fish resources and to\nmaximize the benefits for our people. Protecting the\nfragile marine ecosystem from pollution is a major\nconcern. With the assistance of the UNDP, a study will\nsoon be undertaken to assess the potential danger to the\nmarine environment posed by the large quantity of\nsubmerged ordnance from the Second World War.\nProjects to encourage ecotourism as well as the\nprocessing of forest products within the Solomon Islands\nare being considered.\nThe special session of the General Assembly next\nyear to review the overall implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States promises to be an\nimportant occasion to assess the progress made in the last\nfive years. Solomon Islands will participate actively in the\npreparatory work and in the seventh session of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development and the donors\nconference on small island developing States.\nNatural disaster remains the greatest environmental\nthreat to the peoples of many small island nations. We\nface such calamities as tidal waves and volcanic\neruptions, hurricanes, droughts and floods and rise of the\nsea level from climate warming. During the past year,\nshortages of water and food caused by El Ni\u00f1o severely\naffected Solomon Islands and several other countries in\nthe region, especially where cyclones had struck earlier.\nIntensified international cooperation in early warning\nsystems, disaster mitigation and management strategies\nare needed. We strongly support the renewal of the\n2\n\n\nUnited Nations International Decade for Disaster Reduction\nand related initiatives.\nClimate change remains an issue demanding urgent\nand concrete global collective attention. The Kyoto\nProtocol, which Solomon Islands signed a few days ago, is\na positive step within the climate protection process, but it\nmust be understood to be only one of several. Crucial\nactions, besides the early ratification of the Protocol by all\nparties, include the strengthening of emission reduction\ntargets and commitment to agreed time frames by\nindustrialized countries and the development and transfer of\nappropriate, affordable and environmentally sound\ntechnologies. International commitments to energy\nefficiency and the development of renewable energy\nsources remain key objectives. For small island developing\nStates to meet their obligations, adequate resources must be\ngenerated through the mechanisms provided by the Protocol\nand the Global Environment Facility. These are priority\nissues for the fourth session of the Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change, meeting in Buenos Aires next month.\nOther potential disasters concern us as well. The\nproliferation of nuclear weapons is especially troubling to\nmy Government. Solomon Islands is committed to the\nelimination of these weapons and is proud of the part it\ntook at the International Court of Justice on the issue of\nnuclear weapons. These instruments of terror are creating\ninsecurity in our region. We are also committed to the\nelimination of biological and chemical weapons. The\ncoming entry into force next March of the Ottawa\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction is splendid news indeed, and we thank\nAustria, Canada, Norway and South Africa for their\nextraordinary efforts.\nIn our peaceful islands, the noise of any conflict\nresounds loudly and threateningly. We are indeed pleased\nby the Bougainville peace agreement, which New Zealand\nskilfully helped to negotiate with the important assistance\nof Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu. Crucial for the success of\nthis effort was the willingness of the Government of Papua\nNew Guinea and the other parties to work in good faith.\nWe also thank France for agreeing to a timetable for the\nindependence of New Caledonia.\nThe Alliance for Change Government strongly\ncondemns international terrorism in any form or\nmanifestation. We deplore in the strongest terms what\nhappened in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. Solomon Islands\nsupports the call by previous speakers for the international\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations, to take a\nleading role in combating terrorism. At the same time, we\nrecognize the need to understand the conditions in which\nterrorism is rooted and to change them. The desperate\nacts of men and women have desperate causes.\nInternational partnership is also required in fighting\nthe world\u2019s illicit drug trade. The declaration adopted at\nthe twentieth special session of the General Assembly\ncalls for concrete efforts. My Government is taking the\nnecessary steps at the national level, but the enhancement\nof our interdiction capabilities and the encouragement of\nalternative economic activities require practical\ninternational assistance.\nThe Solomon Islands delegation participated in the\npreparation of the Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt, and we applaud its adoption in Rome. The\nchallenge before us now is to ensure its effective\nimplementation.\nHalf a century after the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the progress achieved,\nalthough significant, is far from satisfactory for hundreds\nof millions of people. Many human rights do not exist,\nexcept on paper, for the over one billion persons who live\nin abject poverty. My Government is committed to\nupholding our people\u2019s fundamental rights, as guaranteed\nby the Solomon Islands Constitution. We strive to\nmaintain human dignity. Although resource constraints\nhinder our ability to fulfil the reporting obligations of the\ninternational instruments to which we are a party, we will\nnot fail to meet our human rights obligations. Nor will we\nbe silent when the rights of others are denied.\nWe call once again for the representation and\nparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\nUnited Nations and its agencies. When the General\nAssembly refuses to place this matter on its agenda, it\ndenies to the nearly 22 million people of Taiwan their\nrights under the Charter of this Organization. It rejects the\nopportunity to foster peace and security in the Taiwan\nStrait through dialogue here at the United Nations. It turns\nits back on preventive diplomacy. Surely the General\nAssembly is better than this. The people of this politically\nstable, economically strong and technologically advanced\ndemocracy have amply demonstrated how much they have\nto offer their region and the world. With the new\nmillennium nearly upon us, it is time to discard old\npatterns of thought if the Chinese motherland is to reunite\npeacefully. My Government will continue to appeal to the\n3\n\n\nUnited Nations to seriously consider and recognize the\nlegitimate right of the people of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to have a voice in this international arena.\nDuring the \u201creform Assembly\u201d, Solomon Islands\nsupported the proposals of the Secretary-General. My\ndelegation actively participated in the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Security Council. Reform of the Council\nshould move boldly toward greater democracy and\ntransparency. Expansion of its membership must reflect\nequitable geographical representation, and close thought\nneeds to be given to the composition of the regional groups.\nIf the veto cannot be decently buried, it should be restricted\nto Chapter VII questions.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s proposal for a Millennium\nAssembly in September 2000 to identify priorities for\nUnited Nation action is refreshing. Critical for the success\nof the Assembly will be the two years of international\ndialogue, involving the widest possible spectrum of\nparticipants, leading up to it. The dialogues must truly be\ndialogues and not long series of monologues in which\npeople talk past one another. A leading candidate for one\nof the priorities to be adopted by the Millennium Assembly\nis debt forgiveness for the heavily indebted poor countries.\nCanada, Germany and the United Kingdom are to be\ncommended for their recent debt-forgiving actions. We also\nappreciate the Nordic countries who have fulfilled their\ntargets and commitments for official development\nassistance.\nSolomon Islands celebrated the twentieth anniversary\nof its independence last July. The past two decades have\nbeen difficult but peaceful. My Government wishes to\nacknowledge the contribution of the international\ncommunity, especially our development partners, including\nthe non-governmental organizations. We especially thank\nour citizens for their patience and support towards our\ndevelopment endeavours. We are committed to\nstrengthening these partnerships. We must work together to\nmeet the challenges of the next millennium successfully.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the crucial post of President of the General\nAssembly and to wish you success in guiding the work of\nthis important forum.\nThe example of Tajikistan clearly demonstrates the\nfruitfulness of close cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations in peacekeeping\nactivities and highlights the need for the international\ncommunity to implement a coordinated strategy to support\nthe efforts of the Government and people of a country to\nresolve crises, overcome instability and find ways to\nachieve lasting peace, national reconciliation and\nprosperity. We welcome the key role played by the\nUnited Nations in coordinating this multifaceted work.\nI would like once again to express my profound\ngratitude to all Members of the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for their growing and multifaceted support for the\npeace process in Tajikistan and for their overall\nunflagging attention to our problems, which, regrettably,\nremain acute.\nWe commend the efforts of all States and\ninternational organizations that are acting as guarantors of\nthe General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and\nNational Accord in Tajikistan signed on 27 June last year\nin Moscow and reached with the assistance of the United\nNations. During the almost five years they were stationed\non the territory of Tajikistan, the collective peacekeeping\nforces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, by\ntheir presence and practical actions, helped stabilize the\nsituation in our country and helped us continue to pursue\nthe complex inter-Tajik political dialogue. This has led to\nthe implementation of the historic agreements that\nresulted from these talks.\nWe express our deep appreciation to all our friends\n\u2014 countries and international organizations, and in\nparticular United Nations agencies \u2014 that empathize with\nthe people of Tajikistan in their hardships and are trying\nto help them overcome them as soon as possible.\nWhile paying due tribute to the United Nations for\nits contribution to the strengthening of peace and national\nreconciliation in Tajikistan, we are fully aware that the\nprimary responsibility for restoring peaceful life in our\ncountry and for the future of our motherland lies with the\nleadership of the Republic of Tajikistan and with the\nTajik opposition.\n19\n\n\nWe believe that the peace process in Tajikistan,\nthough arduous, is becoming more established and is\nmoving towards national accord. This is born out by the\nfact that the work of the Commission on National\nReconciliation has definitely entered a constructive phase.\nThe majority of refugees and displaced persons have\nreturned home. The process of reintegrating the United\nTajik Opposition armed formations into the Government\nmilitary structures has begun. The majority of the\nparticipants in the military and political resistance\nmovement have been granted amnesty and released from\nprison. All prisoners of war have been released. Virtually\nall the leaders of the Opposition forces have returned to the\ncountry and are living and working in Dushanbe.\nRepresentatives of the Opposition have been appointed to\na number of important Government posts. A process is\nunder way to bring the nation\u2019s laws up to date with the\nnew needs of political life in Tajikistan. A number of other\nserious measures have also been implemented.\nGuided by the vital aspirations of the people and\nrecognizing that there is no viable alternative to full and\ntimely implementation of the Tajikistan General Agreement,\nthe country\u2019s leadership is determined to continue to do all\nit can to ensure speedy implementation of all the provisions\nof the General Agreement.\nWe are grateful for the empathy for our problems\nshown by the former Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General for Tajikistan, Mr. Gerd Dietrich\nMerrem, who completed his work in May this year. We are\nprepared to build on this positive experience of cooperation\nin our relations with his successor, Mr. Jan Kubisz.\nTajikistan has great respect for the United Nations\nMission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and for all its\nstaff. These brave and noble people are serving a lofty goal\nunder difficult conditions and are making a valuable\ncontribution to the attainment of national accord and the\nestablishment of peace and tranquillity in our country.\nThe Government of the Republic of Tajikistan\nreaffirms its desire to continue to closely cooperate with the\nUnited Nations in implementing the peace accords and in\nthe post-conflict reconstruction of the country. We have\ntaken decisive action to prevent excesses similar to the\ntragic death this past July of four UNMOT officers, and to\nprovide better security for all personnel of international\norganizations present in Tajikistan.\nWhile in no way diminishing the United Nations\nobvious achievements in organizing collective international\nresponses to crisis situations in various regions of the\nworld, we feel obliged to draw attention once again to the\ndangerous, protracted Afghan conflict, which remains\nunresolved. We have particular reason for highlighting\nthis problem \u2014 above all because we feel profound\nsympathy for the continuing sufferings of the fraternal\npeople of Afghanistan. Moreover, we, together with our\nnearest neighbours and Russia, are very seriously\nconcerned about the dangers posed by the situation in\nAfghanistan, which threatens to destabilize the entire\nCentral Asian region; to lead to a massive and\nspontaneous exodus of Afghan refugees across the border\ninto Tajikistan; and to spread terrorism, arms and drugs.\nWe are especially alarmed about the threat of the\nproliferation of religious extremism, and are joining\nforces with Russia and Uzbekistan to counter it. Since the\ninter-Tajik reconciliation process has not been completed,\nall these factors are impacting very negatively on the\nsituation in our country.\nAs the history of Afghanistan shows, the use of\nforce by any internal or external actors not only is\nincapable of solving the problems of Afghan society, but\nis fraught with the danger of a new escalation of civil war\nin that country. In this context, we cannot but feel\nalarmed at developments in Afghanistan, in particular the\nopen disregard for the efforts of the international\ncommunity to find a political solution to the conflict and\nfor the Afghan people\u2019s desire to preserve the integrity of\ntheir State.\nWe, together with the other members of the Almaty\nFive, are closely following developments in the Islamic\nState of Afghanistan. Tajikistan fully supports the United\nNations playing a central role in coordinating all\ninternational efforts to find an Afghan settlement. As a\nmember of the group of neighbours and friends of\nAfghanistan, the Six plus Two group, we are firm in our\nopposition to any external interference in the affairs of\nAfghanistan, including interference in the form of sending\nmilitary personnel and arms to that country.\nThe Republic of Tajikistan notes the important role\nplayed by the United Nations in disarmament and in a\nwhole range of problems related to strengthening non-\nproliferation regimes with regard to weapons of mass\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. In this context,\nwe are joining the initiative of our neighbours to create a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. We believe the\nestablishment of such a nuclear-free zone requires, first\nand foremost, action on the part of prospective parties to\nthat treaty. We need to consider such questions as the\n20\n\n\ndefinitive geographical configuration of this zone; the\nsubstance and range of guarantees granted to the parties by\nthe nuclear Powers; how to deal with any transporting of\nnuclear weapons through such a zone; verification\nmeasures; and other matters.\nOur position on the establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia cannot overlook the fact\nthat India and Pakistan have conducted nuclear tests. We\nfully support the urgent appeal of the Security Council to\nIndia and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We believe that\nboth these countries \u2014 along with the overwhelming\nmajority of members of the international community \u2014\nmust choose the path of preventing the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons.\nThe evolution of the world economy today is\ncharacterized by increasing globalization and liberalization.\nThis is reflected in the growing interdependence and greater\nopenness of national economies and of commodity and\nfinancial markets \u2014 a development that is beginning to\nhave both positive and negative impacts.\nWe share the view that, in addition to national efforts\nto increase their economic and social potential, developing\ncountries and those in transition need the consolidated\nsupport of the international community, including that of\nthe United Nations and other multilateral institutions.\nAbove all, we have in mind two things: first, the\ncreation of favourable international conditions so as to\nprovide open access to markets, as well as to financial\nresources and modern technology; secondly, assistance in\novercoming poverty, protecting the environment,\nimplementing economic reforms and enhancing the\ncompetitiveness of national enterprises. Unless we resolve\nthese problems, it will be impossible to fully integrate\ncountries in transition into the world economy.\nFor Tajikistan those matters are all the more relevant\ngiven that our country has many outstanding problems\ncaused by the prolonged period of military confrontation, as\nwell as challenges directly related to its peaceful settlement.\nThey include the humanitarian needs of rather large and\nvulnerable segments of the country\u2019s population \u2014 needs\nfor food, medicine and health care. Vital infrastructure, in\nparticular for water supply and sanitation, needs to be\nrehabilitated. And, finally, assistance is needed to help\nrefugees and displaced persons return home, and to\ndemobilize and reintegrate the Tajik Opposition fighters\ninto civilian life.\nThe leadership of Tajikistan is doing all it can to\ndeal with the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis caused by the\ninternal conflict, to rebuild the basic elements of the\nnational economy and to make progress in transforming\nit into a socially oriented market economy. However,\nthese efforts will be insufficient without the assistance of\nmany countries and international organizations, including\nthe humanitarian agencies of the United Nations system\nand the charitable funds. In this regard, we note in\nparticular the work of the United Nations Resident\nCoordinator in Tajikistan, who is responsible for\ncoordinating international aid to Tajikistan for its post-\nconflict reconstruction and further sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWe hope that at this fifty-third session there will be\nbroad support for a resolution that fully reflects\nTajikistan\u2019s needs at this difficult stage in its\ndevelopment, including the tasks related to\nimplementation of the General Agreement on the\nEstablishment of Peace and National Accord in our\ncountry.\nWe have gratefully acknowledged the consolidated\nappeal drawn up by United Nations agencies to meet the\nhumanitarian needs of the Tajik people for 1998. This\nappeal clearly defined the priorities and set the minimum\namount of external aid required. We would be grateful to\ndonors if, reflecting the spirit of support for the peace\nprocess in Tajikistan expressed at the Vienna meeting of\ndonors in October last year and at the Paris conference\nheld in May this year, they would meet the goals of this\nappeal.\nWe attach great importance to continuing our\ncooperation with institutions such as the World Bank and\nthe International Monetary Fund, which are seeking to\nprovide assistance during the post-conflict reconstruction\nand development of the Tajik economy. We hope that in\nthe near future this cooperation will further expand.\nTajikistan consistently supports various United\nNations efforts to protect the environment. As a\npredominantly mountainous country, Tajikistan sees\nparticular relevance in increasing the attention paid by the\ninternational community to the preservation of biological\ndiversity and natural mountain ecosystems. In this\nconnection, we actively supported the proposal of the\nKyrgyz Republic to declare the year 2000 the\n21\n\n\nInternational Year of the Mountain. We were one of the co-\nsponsors of the relevant draft resolution, which we hope\nwill be adopted by consensus at this session.\nWe are inspired and encouraged by the growing\ninterest of the United Nations in helping to solve the\nenvironmental problems faced by our country and other\ncountries of Central Asia. In our view, one of the most\nserious ecological challenges posed not only to Tajikistan\nbut to almost all the countries of the region is to eliminate\nthe potential threat of the major natural disasters that could\noccur if no effective action is taken to normalize the\nsituation in the area of Lake Sarez, which lies 3,263 metres\nabove sea level and contains 17 billion tonnes of water.\nThis poses a grave danger not only for the people of\nTajikistan but also for neighbouring Uzbekistan,\nTurkmenistan and Afghanistan, which could sustain serious\ndamage in the event of a breakage of the natural dam that\nwas formed at the beginning of this century as a result of\nan earthquake. We count on our renewed cooperation with\nthe United Nations for help in dealing with this problem in\na comprehensive manner.\nAmong the many problems on the United Nations\nagenda, we would like to stress the issue of combating the\ndrug menace, whose deleterious impact, unfortunately, has\nnot bypassed our country. We fully support the coordinating\nrole of the United Nations in the mobilization of the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts in this area. We note the\nusefulness and timeliness of the convening in June this year\nof the special session of the General Assembly devoted to\nthis issue.\nTajikistan, together with its closest neighbours, is\ntaking active steps to halt illicit drug trafficking. It is\nbroadening its cooperation with the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme. As is well known\nto those who have observed the situation in one of our\nneighbouring countries, \u201cnarcodollars\u201d create fertile soil for\nterrorism and illicit drugs and arms trafficking. We view\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations as a grave\ncrime against humanity. The Government of the Republic\nof Tajikistan vigorously condemns the acts of violence that\nhave been committed recently in certain countries. We call\nupon the United Nations and its Members to declare\nmerciless and uncompromising war on terrorism all over\nthe world.\nTajikistan supports the steps being taken by the\nSecretary-General to reform the entire United Nations\nsystem to enable it to serve better in a new environment,\nand to deal with different issues without undermining the\nfoundation of its activities. This point must be taken into\naccount when dealing with expansion of the membership\nof the Security Council, so that this important body can\ncontinue effectively and expeditiously to discharge its\nprimary responsibility under the United Nations Charter:\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nWe are confident that the joint efforts of Members\nto reform the Organization will lead to a renewal which\nwill preserve its universal character and its ability to\nadequately meet current and future challenges.\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda, I would\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside\nover the General Assembly at this fifty-third session. You\nare well known to envoys from my country who have\nworked with you and who can attest to your humanistic and\nunprejudiced vision of the world. We feel confident that\nunder your guidance this will be a productive session. I\nlikewise wish to express my country\u2019s recognition to your\npredecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the skilful\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second\nsession. I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, who is\nentrusted with the advancement of this Organization at such\na critical time in history. I am also grateful to the\nSecretariat for scheduling Antigua and Barbuda in this slot.\nThis year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), of which Antigua and\nBarbuda is a proud member. Despite the utterances of the\nprophets of doom, CARICOM did much more than survive,\nand the areas of cooperation deepened and widened. What\nstarted as a free-trade arrangement has expanded, and is\nnow marked by a number of significant institutions in areas\nsuch as education and health, as well as in sports and\nculture. This year the Order of the Caribbean Community\naward was given to four individuals, among them the\nformer Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, the Right\nHonourable Vere Cornwall Bird, appropriately dubbed \u201cThe\nfather of the Nation\u201d. In accepting the award, the former\nPrime Minister stated:\n\u201cdespite the difficulties, we have erected fine\ninstitutions \u2014 institutions that are a tribute to the\nresourcefulness of our leaders and the support of the\npeople. But, difficult as they were to build, it is easy\nfor them to be tumbled unless today\u2019s leaders and\npeople are prepared to safeguard and preserve them.\nTo do so requires the same vision, the same\ndetermination and the same spirit of selflessness that\nmotivated the previous generation.\u201d\nI assure you, Mr. President, that the spirit that he\nmentioned is steadfast among us, and that there is no\nturning back.\nPeace, security and disarmament are vital to a safe\nand secure planet, and the countless individuals who live\ndaily in constant fear, whether in regard to terrorists,\nhatred between ethnic groups, internecine warfare or\nreligious persecution, give us much concern. Added to\nthat is the expanding nuclear rivalry. The nuclear club is\nno longer exclusive to the five permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. The question to be posed is whether the\nfive long-time nuclear Powers will now accept that the\nonly way to prevent nuclear proliferation is to abolish all\nnuclear weapons, a factor that has been repeatedly\nstressed in debates within these hallowed walls and in\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Or will the club quickly\nmove beyond the present seven members? We urge that\nthis matter be given the serious consideration it deserves,\nas we must commit ourselves to future generations. But\nwe are presently dismayed about the future of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nIrrespective of the high praise given to globalization,\nto most of the developing world it hurts, and hurts\nexcessively. For the past four years \u2014 that is, since the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \u2014\ndisturbing signs have emerged of trends which point in\nthe direction of exclusion rather than inclusion, and of\nmarginalization rather than integration. And these trends\nare now having a serious negative effect on countries\nwhich recently were optimistically viewing their\nprospects.\nThe multilateral financial institutions, which provide\nresources to developing countries at concessional rates,\ncontinue, despite numerous protests and logical arguments\npresented to them, to use gross national product as a basis\nfor judging our economic wherewithal. Somehow,\nglobalization and liberalization will work magic,\nirrespective of the existing and deep-seated problems of\nsmall States, it is assumed. The case of bananas must be\nhighlighted. The undoing of the Lom\u00e9 trade agreement,\nwith the injury which this hostile act can inflict on the\nsmall banana-exporting countries of the Organization of\nEastern Caribbean States, of which Antigua and Barbuda\nis a member, gives grave cause for concern. Small, peaceloving States, causing no harm to any other State under\nthe terms of the Lom\u00e9 agreement, have found themselves\nyoked by the World Trade Organization ruling. Without\nsome form of protection, the banana industry in the\n10\n\n\nCARICOM States could collapse, leading to severe social\ndislocation, which would ultimately manifest itself in\npolitical catastrophe.\nThe multilateral trading system needs to be fair and\nequitable, and the imbalances in the present agreements\nshould be rectified. The benefits of the system should\naccrue to all States in relation to their needs, and not in\nproportion to their share in international trade. There needs\nto be recognition of the serious limitations of the principle\nof reciprocity as an instrument for mutually advantageous\ntrading arrangements when the participating countries have\ndifferent levels of development. The WTO must contribute\nto achieving positive coherence in global economic policy.\nWidespread and equitably shared economic growth\nwill surely benefit all. In fact, the developed countries will\nbe important beneficiaries of the economic growth and\ndevelopment of developing countries, which will provide\nlarger markets and better opportunities, respectively, for\ntheir products and investment. This will also lead to global\npeace and prosperity, ensuring a truly stable framework for\ninternational relations based on mutuality of benefits.\nMy Government welcomed the twentieth special\nsession of the General Assembly on the world drug\nproblem, held between 8 and 10 June 1998. In the\nCaribbean the Non-Self-Governing Territories have the\nsame problems in regard to narcotics as the independent\ncountries. There is a multidimensional thrust upon our\nentities, as there is a challenge to governability by nonState actors and the drug operators. The influence of the\ndrug-traffickers forces our Governments to shift very\nlimited resources from development priorities to law\nenforcement and the rehabilitation of addicts. The social\nerosion, economic dislocation and increase in criminal\nactivity mean that for small societies striving to overcome\neconomic vulnerability it becomes a tremendous challenge\nto maintain functioning institutions in an environment with\nthe potential for decreased productivity.\nQuite frankly, there is the possibility for all of us to\nbecome the involuntary victims of the drug trade. It is no\nsecret that the small island developing States and low-lying\ncoastal States of the Caribbean have inadequate defences\nagainst the vast resources of the drug-traffickers. In\naddition, if we are not sufficiently fearful of the devastation\nthat can be caused by the illicit traffic in narcotics, we must\nbe gravely concerned about the destruction that can\naccompany the attendant traffic in small arms and\nammunition. In one of the most comprehensive plans of\naction on Caribbean policy and development, the West\nIndian Commission noted that nothing poses greater\nthreats to civil society in CARICOM countries than the\ndrug problem; and nothing exemplifies the powerlessness\nof regional Governments more.\nMy Prime Minister addressed the issue of\npowerlessness of regional Governments in a recent\nstatement to the Caribbean Studies Association. In that\nstatement he referred to the dictatorial approach taken by\ncertain countries. Given our limited capabilities, we\nacknowledge the importance of cooperation to develop\nmechanisms that can respond to incidents of drugtrafficking. We encourage collaboration, therefore, where\nappropriate, to achieve the desired results \u2014 the\napprehension and conviction of criminals.\nAllow me to speak briefly on the subject of\nalternative development policies. Antigua and Barbuda\nand indeed other Caribbean countries that introduced an\noffshore financial services sector did so as a direct\nresponse to the perceived need to diversify our economies\nin the face of globalization and trade liberalization. On\nthe one hand, when we choose the financial services\nsector and follow the example of other countries that have\ndone so before us, we are labelled as havens for moneylaunderers and corruption, and steps are taken to\nundermine our efforts and limit the competitive advantage\nthat we may enjoy. We do not believe that this approach\nlends itself to genuine partnership and mutual respect.\nWhat we need is collaboration, information exchange and\ntechnical support to assist us in ensuring that our financial\nservices sector is not abused by dubious sources while it\nprovides us with much needed economic resources.\nHistory clearly proves that drug abuse and illicit\ntrafficking know no boundaries; no country is inoculated\nagainst their effects. It is logical to conclude, therefore,\nthat the fight against drug-trafficking and abuse must\ntranscend any individual country strategy.\nMy Government supports an unbiased approach to\nthe United Nations thematic agenda on drug control for\nthe twenty-first century. The decision to focus on demand\nreduction, elimination of illicit crops, judicial cooperation,\nmoney-laundering, stemming illicit production of synthetic\ndrugs and the control of drug-production chemicals must\nbe consistent with the desire for a global strategy against\ndrug-trafficking. The transnational nature of the drug\nproblem warrants such concerted action to create the\ndrug-free world that we all desire.\n11\n\n\nAntigua and Barbuda is committed to this global\nstrategy. We have signed a number of interdiction\nagreements and appointed an official to coordinate national\naction against drug-trafficking and related crimes. This\nofficial works closely with the Attorney General to ensure\nformulation and implementation of the national drug policy.\nIn addition to the policy initiatives, we are currently\ncompleting work on a drug treatment facility that we hope\nwill be used not only as a centre for rehabilitation, but also\nas a training facility in the region.\nIt seems logical that a word should be said here in\nregard to the adoption of the Statute for the International\nCriminal Court, as Caribbean nations had hoped that such\na Court would aid in the elimination of the narcotic\nscourge. The media did not, to any significant extent,\ndiffuse the idea that it was a Caribbean country, Trinidad\nand Tobago, that revived the idea for an international\ncriminal court after a lapse of 41 years. In 1989 Trinidad\nand Tobago reintroduced to the United Nations the concept\nof 1948.\nBut the specific reasons for establishing the Court as\nadvanced by Trinidad and Tobago and other States of the\nCaribbean Community were put on the back burner. We\nhad pleaded for a Court that would try to sentence those\ninvolved in the trans-shipment of narcotics, in terrorism and\nin marine abuses, including the violation of our territorial\nwaters. What is before us is a Court emphasizing genocide,\nwar crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of\naggression. All of these we support, yet we are faced with\na clear indication that we are still on the periphery.\nThe West Indies have always been on the periphery of\ndominant economic systems \u2014 in reference, that is, to the\npost-Columbian era. The West Indies, since the initial\nperiod of colonization, have provided goods and services\nfor more advanced industrial entities. The very nature of\nour colonization \u2014 that is, to exist as colonies of\nexploitation as opposed to colonies of settlement \u2014\ndemanded continued underdevelopment. The sad thing is\nthat, today, the multilateral financial institutions which\nprovide resources to developing countries at concessional\nrates continue to use gross national product as a basis for\njudging our economic wherewithal. The present situation in\nregard to my country provides a most germane example.\nThe envoys of Antigua and Barbuda are basking in\ntheir glory because of the high ranking the country received\nin the 1998 Human Development Report. The laudations\nand accommodations received have been profuse, but this\nvery factor puts forward the absurd premise that we are\nmore developed than Mexico or Brazil. Antigua and\nBarbuda is deemed to be middle-income, and its\nnumerous vulnerabilities are ignored as gross national\nproduct is the sole deciding factor. Our challenge is to\nconvince the international agencies that we should be on\nthe priority list for development loans and assistance.\nAntigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean countries have\ndemonstrated how developing countries can use their\nlimited resources for the advancement of their\npopulations. We should not be penalized for progress.\nSmall island developing States are constantly and\ncontinually at risk, whether through sea-level rise,\nhurricanes, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, as has been\nthe case with the emerald isle of Montserrat. A single\nhurricane can put back our development some 10 years.\nFor ourselves, we have put out a plea for international\nassistance, as for the third time in three years we have\nbeen afflicted by a hurricane. Until the passage of\nhurricane Georges, our country had been advancing\nbecause of the prudent and experienced management for\nwhich we are known. We had built a network of superb\nroads and improved our telecommunications system,\ntourism had re-established itself after the powerful\nHurricane Louis of 1995, new buildings including schools\nhad been erected, and our economy was on course for 8\nper cent growth by the end of the year. This, of course,\nduly manifests the absurdity of using gross national\nproduct as a basis for eliminating us from consideration\nfor concessional loans. At present we have to ask our\nfriends and well-wishers for assistance. In that connection,\na draft resolution is being circulated on United Nations\nassistance to Caribbean countries affected by hurricane\nGeorges.\nThis year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. My country will\ncontinue to focus on efforts to ensure that the protection\nof human rights is integrated into all activities of the\nUnited Nations system. We view seriously the many\nreports of child abuse worldwide. We are concerned about\nchildren affected by internecine warfare, and the now\nrampant tales of child labour, child prostitution and child\npornography. Additionally, we will remain vigilant in\nseeing to the mainstreaming of women\u2019s concerns.\nOverall, my country will be exercising efforts to see to\nthe furtherance of endeavours to strengthen human rights\nprogrammes.\nIn approaching the twenty-first century, the\nGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda has decided that it\nshould focus on human capital and its development, rather\n12\n\n\nthan focusing narrowly on the economic question. There\nwill be a continuance of the policy of carrying out intense\ninvestigations and feasibility studies to decide on where to\nconcentrate limited resources. In addition, even though the\nGovernment is divesting itself of some of its holdings and\nencouraging greater private investment in vital services and\ncommodities, there are some areas, particularly those\nsurrounding technology, in which the Government has to\nremain directly involved and catalytic; it will continue its\npractice of seeking consensus to determine key industries\nand activities that are crucial and critical for development.\nIn concluding, a statement has to be made in regard to\nour appreciation for the work done in the Caribbean by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme. Particular thanks\nhave to be expressed for its work in economic management\nand governance initiatives. We will continue to be proud of\nand to cherish the United Nations, as we recognize its\ncapacity for achievements in areas beyond the reach of\nnational or regional authorities. Subsequently, the nations\nthat compose this Assembly must redouble their collective\ncommitment to translate vision into reality. That is why it\nis essential to have international cooperation for\ndevelopment in the forefront of our activities. The United\nNations is still our greatest hope for peace, development\nand social justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I take\npleasure in congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession, and I pledge my delegation\u2019s full cooperation. I\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for bringing the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly to a\nsuccessful conclusion. I take great pleasure in expressing\nmy pride in our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. His\nleadership and many achievements during the short period\nof his tenure are highly commendable.\nJust as this session of the General Assembly\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, it also coincides,\nprovidentially, with the fiftieth anniversary of the\ncommencement of peacekeeping operations by the United\nNations. These coincidences are striking because, while\none was envisaged in the Charter of our Organization and\nwas the subject of painstaking negotiations, the other was\na chance development, not having been envisaged in the\nCharter. Yet both have had a profound effect on the\ninfluence of the United Nations in global affairs and on\nthe perception of the Organization by those whom it was\nestablished to serve and who were identified in the\nopening words of the Charter as \u201cWe the peoples of the\nUnited Nations\u201d.\nThe double celebration this year should also enable\nus to appreciate better the interrelationship between\nhuman rights and peacekeeping. There can be no question\nof human rights being enjoyed in a situation of conflict.\nPut another way, conflicts create conditions for the most\noutrageous violations of human rights, since, contrary to\nall international law and rationality, the most vulnerable\nin society \u2014 children, women and the aged \u2014 are often\ntargeted and deprived of the most basic of human rights,\nthe right to life. As we define and refine our\nOrganization\u2019s responsibilities in peacekeeping, which, by\ncommon consent, is now taken in its broadest sense to\nmean the prevention, management and resolution of\nconflicts, let us always be conscious that the universal\nenjoyment of human rights, one of the major aspirations\nof humanity, cannot and will not be achieved unless we\ndevote as much effort to the elimination of the conditions\nthat provoke the violation of those rights.\nI believe that it is with this fact in mind that\ninternational organizations, whether global, regional or\nsubregional, have been devoting considerable time to\ndevising effective means of preventing, managing and\nresolving conflicts in their various area of competence. Of\ncourse, the United Nations, with its unique role as the\nonly global Organization invested with authority for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, is,\nappropriately, taking the lead in these efforts. Following\n\u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d (A/47/277) and its supplement\n(A/50/60), and at the request of the Security Council, the\n4\n\n\nSecretary-General presented to us at this session his report\nentitled \u201cThe causes of conflict and the promotion of\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa\u201d,\ndocument A/52/871. The report represents a very\ncomprehensive and incisive study of the causes of conflict\nin Africa. The recommendations therein, if implemented by\nAfrican countries as well as by the United Nations, could\nreverse the pestilence of conflicts which are ravaging the\ncontinent.\nIn this connection, my delegation would like to\nunderscore the role of the Security Council in dealing with\nAfrican conflicts. While the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) has demonstrated a commitment to taking the lead\nin the resolution of conflicts on the continent, the fact is\nthat its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\nand Resolution will take time and will require resources not\nimmediately available to Africa if it is to evolve to its\nmaximum capacity. In the meantime, the efforts of the\nsubregional organizations, which are increasingly taking the\ninitiative in their various regions, need to be adequately\nsupported by the international community.\nMy country, the Central African Republic, has been\nthe beneficiary of such an initiative, which was taken by a\ngroup of African countries, to deal with the internal\nconflicts that erupted with three successive army mutinies\nin 1996. The Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB), which\nwas composed of troops from Gabon, Chad, Burkina Faso,\nMali, Senegal and Togo, was given strong logistic support\nby France. It operated in Bangui from January 1997 to\nApril 1998 as both a force of interposition and a guarantor\nto ensure the observance of the peace accord which was\nbrokered by four African heads of State. My delegation\nwould like to pay very high tribute to the Presidents of\nGabon, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Senegal and Togo for\nthe great sacrifice they made in the interests of our\ncontinent.\nI should also like to pay great tribute to France for its\ninvaluable support of the African initiative. At the request\nof my head of State, and with the agreement of the inter-\nAfrican group, the Security Council graciously consented to\nsend a United Nations peacekeeping operation to replace\nthe inter African force.\nThe United Nations Mission in the Central African\nRepublic (MINURCA), which commenced operations in\nBangui on 15 April 1998, is the first proactive mission\nestablished by the United Nations in Africa. It has been\nmaking a major contribution to the restoration of lasting\npeace and security in our country and has assisted the\npeace-building efforts of the Government and the people\nof the Central African Republic. It is a practical\ndemonstration of the incisive observation of our\nSecretary-General, in his report entitled \u201cThe causes of\nconflicts and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa\u201d, to the effect that\n\u201cthe deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeeping\noperation may well represent the best chance to\nestablish peace and build a foundation for lasting\ndevelopment, based on respect for human rights and\nthe rehabilitation of civic institutions.\u201d (A/52/871,\npara. 37)\nA major step in the restoration of the institutions of\nState in our country is the organization of a free, fair and\ntransparent legislative election. In his letter to the\nSecretary-General requesting the assistance of the\ninternational community in re-establishing peace and\nsecurity, my President, Mr. Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, invited\nthe United Nations, inter alia, to supervise the legislative\nand presidential elections in the country. That request was\na measure of both the confidence which we have in the\nUnited Nations and our commitment to a transparent\ndemocracy built on the freely expressed will of our\npeople. I wish therefore to express my Government\u2019s\nsatisfaction for the assistance of MINURCA in the\npreparations for the legislative elections. We are looking\nforward to the decision of the Security Council which will\nenable MINURCA to provide further assistance for the\nelectoral process, thus giving all Central Africans the\nassurance of the freedom, fairness and transparency of\nthis most important aspect of the democratic process.\nNeedless to say, United Nations assistance in the\nprocess is a worthwhile investment in good governance,\nwhich itself is the sure foundation for peace, security and\ndevelopment. No effort should therefore be spared by our\nOrganization in rallying to the support of those Member\nStates that are making genuine efforts to instal a system\nthat in itself constitutes a conflict-prevention mechanism.\nThe cost of such support, which also constitutes an\ninvestment in peace-building, is in the end much less, and\nthe results more satisfying, than those of a fire-fighting\nresponse after the outbreak of a conflict.\nBearing these factors in mind, I wish to appeal, on\nbehalf of my Government, to the Security Council to take\na comprehensive approach that avoids a premature exit of\nMINURCA, thus compromising the objective for which\nthe Mission was installed in Bangui. My Government has\n5\n\n\nexerted itself to fulfil the commitments made by President\nPatass\u00e9 to transparency and accountability in his letter to\nthe Secretary-General requesting the presence of the United\nNations in our country.\nOne major result of those efforts was the positive\njudgment of the Bretton Woods institutions which permitted\nthe conclusion last July of a long-sought accord on\nenhanced structural adjustment facility. Needless to say, this\nwould not have been possible without the assurance of\nsecurity given by the presence and the activities of\nMINURCA.\nHowever, much remains to be done, and the presence\nand cooperation of MINURCA will be indispensable for\nsuccess. Most important is the restructuring and retraining\nof our security services, both civil and military. The\ncommencement by MINURCA of the retraining of the\nvarious categories of our police and gendarmerie services\nhave already yielded some positive results, and the\ncontinuation of the programme, as is being done in other\nUnited Nations operations in other parts of the world, will\nprove an invaluable legacy of United Nations peace-\nbuilding efforts in our country.\nAfrica should not be denied this benefit which\nemanates from the reappraisal of the components of\ncomprehensive United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nCivilian police training programmes have become an\nessential element of these operations, but they have not\nbeen known to commence and end in a period of nine\nmonths. An African situation cannot be presumed to be\ndifferent, particularly when it is in the region now\nconsidered to be most prone to the phenomenon of\nconflicts.\nBesides, the restructuring of our armed forces is being\ncommenced with the involvement of MINURCA, which\nwas given a role to play by Security Council resolution\n1182 (1998) of 14 July 1998. The joint committee\nconsisting of representatives of the Government and of\nMINURCA is to elaborate the legal instrument which\nshould form the basis for our defence policy and armed\nforces, as well as a comprehensive programme for a widely\nrepresentative, national, and well-trained force that will also\nbe a useful instrument for development. The hope of my\nGovernment is that the Security Council will allow\nMINURCA sufficient time to assist us in these\nindispensable peace-building endeavours. A withdrawal, as\nis being contemplated at this time, will not be in the\ninterest of my country or of the Central African subregion,\nwhich is already in great turmoil. I cannot but recall once\nagain the very pertinent observation of the Secretary-\nGeneral in the report which he painstakingly compiled at\nthe request of the Security Council:\n\u201cthe deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeeping\noperation may well represent the best chance to\nestablish peace and build a foundation for lasting\ndevelopment, based on respect for human rights and\nthe rehabilitation of civic institutions.\u201d (ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I convey to you, Sir,\non behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, our\nfelicitations on your unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. With a person\nof your eminence and experience in the Chair, our session\nis assured of a successful outcome.\nTo your predecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko, I express\nour deep appreciation for a job well done. We truly had a\nreform Assembly. It was a matter of great satisfaction for\nBangladesh to support his brilliant work on United Nations\nreform, especially through our role as the Chairman of the\nAdministrative and Budgetary Committee. We are\nparticularly grateful that, at the concluding meeting of the\nfifty-second session, he appealed to the international\ncommunity for solidarity with the people of Bangladesh at\na time when our country was inundated by the worst floods\nin our history.\n\n\nIn this year\u00e2s unprecedented floods, two thirds of our\ncountry was completely inundated and nearly 31 million\npeople were affected. Over 20 million were rendered\nhomeless. Immense damage was done to crops, roads,\nbridges, clinics, schools and industrial plants. With the\nreceding of the flood waters, we are bracing ourselves for\nthe even greater problems of water-borne diseases and\nscarcity of food and safe drinking water, compounded by\nhomelessness and unemployment. Under the direct\nsupervision of Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina, we are\nreaching out to the affected people with assistance. The\nenormous scale of damage challenges us with a task of\ncolossal magnitude. The cost of relief, rehabilitation and\nreconstruction has been estimated at approximately $900\nmillion.\nThe United Nations system, I am happy to say, has\nresponded to our needs and requirements, as have our\ndevelopment partners and many friendly countries. On\nbehalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh, we\nwould like to express our sincere thanks to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his support for and solidarity with\nBangladesh at this hour of need. We are also thankful to\nthe diplomatic missions stationed in Dhaka, the\ninternational organizations, non-governmental organizations\nand Bangladesh nationals abroad for their continued\nsupport, understanding and sympathy towards Bangladesh\nand its efforts to face the challenges. I reiterate here the\nappeal made by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the\ngenerous and continuing support of the international\ncommunity to Bangladesh in the coming days.\nFloods are not unknown in Bangladesh. Flooding as\nwe have been experiencing this year is unprecedented\nboth in magnitude and duration. The Secretary-General in\nhis annual report has referred to threats to human\nsecurity, including natural disasters. Indeed, of all natural\ndisasters floods cause the most widespread havoc and\nmisery.\nBangladesh, of course, is not the only country to\nhave suffered severe flooding this monsoon season. The\ncause of this year\u00e2s floods may well be complex. We\ncannot help but be perturbed, however, by the observation\nin the Human Development Report of this year that global\nwarming could permanently flood large areas and play\nhavoc with harvests. The report cautions that the human\nconsequences of global warming can be devastating for\nmany poor countries like Bangladesh, which could see its\nland area shrunk by as much as 17 per cent with a one\nmetre rise in sea level.\nElements and factors that affect the global ecosystem\nand the environment are interlinked. They transcend\nnational frontiers and can be addressed meaningfully only\nby nations acting in concert. It is a matter of survival for\nmany peoples, and the highest priority should be given to\nthis issue. We have come a long way since Rio, and yet,\nvery few tangible benefits have been achieved in the\nabsence of promised new and additional resources.\nSince assuming office following elections in June\n1996, our Government has been trying to put in place and\nstrengthen institutions and laws that will reinforce\ndemocracy and promote good governance. In December\nlast year, we negotiated an end to the long-standing\nproblem in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Chittagong\nHill Tracts Agreement was concluded within the\nframework of our Constitution, and it fully meets the\nlegitimate concerns of the tribal population. We are now\nputting into place the necessary laws and institutional\nmachinery pertaining to the Agreement and widening\ndevelopmental activities in the area. My Government\nwelcomes cooperation in this effort from all our\ndevelopment partners.\nOur commitment to democracy and the rule of law\nhas prompted us to accord priority to human rights. We\nare in the process of setting up an independent national\n28\n\n\nhuman rights commission. Our objective is to take the\nhuman rights issue to the grass-roots level, to increase\nawareness among our people of their rights that have been\nguaranteed by our Constitution and to make the process of\njustice accessible and affordable to all. A lot remains to be\ndone, and we have made a good beginning.\nBangladesh believes in the centrality of the right to\ndevelopment within the human rights regime. The\nimplementation of the right to development will be further\nenhanced through a binding international treaty on this\nright. We are therefore very pleased that at the recent\nsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban, the\nheads of State and Government endorsed our Prime\nMinster\u00e2s proposal that consideration be given to the\npreparation of a convention on the right to development.\nAt home we have also embarked on a comprehensive\nprogramme of reform and deregulation. Social development\nhas remained the main focus of our development strategy.\nEducation, health care, employment generation and\nwomen\u00e2s empowerment within the broad framework of\nhuman development continue to receive priority attention.\nWe are focusing on the rights of women and children. The\nrole and involvement of civil society in our development\nefforts, particularly in the social sector, have been\nremarkable.\nThe process of globalization and liberalization brings\nrisks, grave challenges and opportunities, but in unequal\nways. The external economic shocks associated with this\nprocess are too powerful for the vulnerable economies to\nabsorb. This is now being recognized even by the\nbeneficiaries of globalization. As has been said, the\nglobalization process must reflect a more inclusive vision\nof shared interests and shared values. We would support the\nviews of the Secretary-General of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that a\nglobal economy should mean that no one will be left\nbehind.\nWe need to ensure that the process of globalization\nand liberalization meets our development needs. We need\nto formulate a positive and workable agenda for ensuring\nthat globalization promotes equity and benefit for all. An\nintegral component of the globalization process is unfettered\nmovement of the factors of production, including capital\nand labour. We need to encourage migration of labour in\norder to ensure balance in globalization.\nOfficial development assistance in real terms has\ndeclined by more than 15 per cent from 1992 to 1996. This\ndecline must be halted and reversed. For the poorest and\nmore vulnerable economies, official development\nassistance remains indispensable. We call on all\ndeveloped countries to reach the agreed target of 0.7 per\ncent for the developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent\nfor the least developed countries as soon as possible,\npreferably by 2000.\nThe least developed countries represent the most\nvulnerable economies and peoples of the world. The\nministerial communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 issued after the 1998 substantive\nsession of the Economic and Social Council underscored\ncertain timely issues. In particular, I would mention the\ncall for working together for enhanced market access for\nthe least developed countries and to support their efforts\nat capacity-building. We also welcome the call for further\nprogress towards zero tariff on exports from least\ndeveloped countries.\nPreferential treatment accorded to least developed\ncountries should not be time-bound. The restrictive trade\nregimes of labour and environmental standards should be\nmade flexible. We need to adequately prepare to address\nthese and other relevant issues in the forthcoming Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries, to be held in 2001.\nThe situation in the least developed countries in\nparticular makes it clear that the eradication of poverty\ncontinues to be our overriding concern. It is essential to\nensure long-term global security, as well as to achieve\nsustainable, economic and social development. We believe\nthat the goal of the Microcredit Summit held last year, to\nreach 100 million of the world\u00e2s poorest families,\nespecially the women of those families, will become a\nreality by the year 2005. Effective microcredit\nprogrammes provide access to small capital to people\nliving in poverty in many countries of the world. In\naddition to the eradication of poverty, the microcredit\nprogrammes have also been contributing to the social and\nhuman development process, particularly the\nempowerment of women.\nAs the Secretary-General has noted in his annual\nreport, the world has been free from large-scale regional\nconflict over the past year. Peace on a global scale and in\na meaningful sense, however, still remains a distant goal.\nThe post-cold-war reality underscores that we need to\nbuild a culture of peace based on the principles enshrined\nin the United Nations Charter and on respect for human\nrights, democracy, tolerance and wider and equal\nparticipation of people in all spheres of human activity.\nWe welcome the proclamation of the year 2000 as the\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace and the\n29\n\n\nproposed proclamation of the period 2001 to 2010 as the\ninternational decade for the culture of peace and non-\nviolence for the children of the world. The Secretary-\nGeneral has been requested to submit a draft declaration\nand programme of action on the culture of peace to this\nsession. We hope it will be possible for the General\nAssembly to adopt these documents at the earliest\nopportunity.\nWe are particularly concerned that hopes for a just,\nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East are yet\nto be fulfilled. The framework for such a peace exists in the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, the principles of the\nMadrid Conference and the Oslo accords. The principle of\nland for peace has been accepted by all, and yet our\nPalestinian brethren continue to be frustrated in their hopes\nand aspirations. New settlements, expansion of the\nJerusalem municipal area and large-scale internment of\nPalestinians without fair trial cannot promote the cause of\npeace. Bangladesh strongly believes that nothing should be\nallowed to thwart the peace process. We would urge that\nevery moral pressure and persuasion be brought to bear\nupon the Israeli authorities so that the peace process can\nprogress to its logical culmination. We look forward to the\nearly establishment of an independent, sovereign State of\nPalestine, with Jerusalem as its capital, and to its full\nmembership of the United Nations.\nThe cause of the sufferings of our brothers and sisters\nin many African countries, particularly in the Great Lakes\nregion, needs to be addressed more comprehensively. The\nrecent plight of the people of Kosovo is a stark reminder of\nthe not-so-distant events of Bosnia. Peace initiatives in\nAfghanistan have yet to make any headway. Peace in that\ncountry has to be built from within. The problem of\nAfghanistan can only be resolved by the Afghan people\nthemselves, without outside interference. In such cases, we\nbelieve in the significant role that the United Nations can\nplay as a peace-builder.\nIn the area of arms control and disarmament, some\nnoteworthy progress has been made. The Ottawa\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines will soon come\ninto force. We welcome the decision of the Conference on\nDisarmament to set up committees on security assurances\nto non-nuclear-weapon States and also on fissile materials.\nFor Bangladesh, the pursuit of general and complete\ndisarmament is a constitutional commitment, and we are\nready to support any and every move that contributes to this\nobjective. The nuclear tests in South Asia have been the\nsubject of much debate, discussion and concern. In this\nconnection, the initiative of Bangladesh\u00e2s Prime Minister\nSheikh Hasina Wajed to minimize tensions in the region\nthrough personal visits and by urging all concerned to\ncontribute towards strengthening peace in South Asia and\nthe world has been widely appreciated. We attach great\nimportance and priority to our relations with our\nneighbouring countries. We are happy at the\nannouncement of moratoriums on further nuclear testing,\nand we remain committed to the goal of a nuclear-\nweapons-free world. We believe that the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), to\nwhich Bangladesh is a party, provide useful frameworks\nfor establishing a nuclear-weapons-free world. It was a\npity to observe that consensus could not be reached in the\nConference on Disarmament to set up an ad hoc\ncommittee for nuclear disarmament.\nLast year, our Secretary-General submitted to the\nGeneral Assembly a package of reform proposals to make\nthe United Nations more streamlined and attuned to\npresent-day problems and realities. Some major decisions\nwere, in fact, adopted by the fifty-second session on the\nbasis of these proposals. This session of the Assembly,\nwe believe, will continue the reform process, resolving in\nparticular the issues relating to the development account,\nresults-based budgeting and the so-called sunset clause.\nReforms have, by definition, to be a continual\nprocess. The United Nations has to be adapted to new\nconditions and problems. On this there can be no two\nopinions. For the past five years we have been discussing\nthe issue of Security Council reform and expansion. We\nhave articulated our particular concerns in different\nworking groups and forums. At the recent Non-Aligned\nMovement summit in Durban, the Movement\u00e2s collective\nposition was reaffirmed. I would also stress that it is the\nweaker and more vulnerable group of countries that has\nthe most vital stake in a dynamic and effective United\nNations and its Security Council. These countries\nconstitute a clear majority among the 185 Member States,\nand their concerns should not be overlooked or glossed\nover in any reform or restructuring exercise. While\nstalemate continues in this area, we are pleased that an\nInternational Criminal Court has seen the light of the day\nafter so many years of efforts. Despite shortcomings, the\nCourt is a milestone in United Nations history.\nBangladesh attaches great importance to the\ncoordinated and integrated follow-up to the decisions\ntaken at the major United Nations conferences of the\n1990s, as an area which contributes effectively to the\nreform process. We believe that the outcomes of these\nconferences provide the international community with the\n30\n\n\nmost important opportunity to ensure a better life for the\npeoples of the world at the outset of the twenty-first\ncentury. In particular, we call for concerted efforts to\nensure the success of the special session of the General\nAssembly next June for the follow-up to the Cairo\npopulation conference. We also welcome the proposed\nmillennium Assembly session and hope that it will look into\nthe issues that will challenge us in the coming decades.\nThis Assembly session should be our outreach into the\nfuture.\nThe end of all political efforts, as a former United\nNations Secretary-General once observed, must be the well-\nbeing of the individual in a life of safety and freedom. This\nis a goal to which no one is averse. It is also something\nthat no nation can achieve on its own in a world that is\nincreasingly interdependent. Peace and security and\ndevelopment in a real sense are indivisible.\nDespite the increasing complexities it faces every day,\nthe United Nations is functioning today more effectively\nand efficiently than before. In recent times it has played a\nfar more constructive and positive role. The United Nations,\nof course, has its critics and, indeed, may even benefit from\nconstructive criticism. There is always scope for change and\nimprovement. The United Nations has had its share of\nfailures, which so often seem much more glaring than its\nquiet successes. There can be no doubt that it remains the\nsole universal platform for humanity to chart its future in\nthe new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his election\nand my appreciation to the former President for all his\nwork over the last year.\nIn looking back over the year, I think we would agree\nthat it has been extremely disturbing for most developing\nnations. At best, it has been one of troubling uncertainty\nand a deep sense of frustration. At worst, it has seen terror\nand despair. It is the uncertainty felt by millions in our own\nregion, caught unprepared by the process of globalization\nand ending up unemployed. It is the frustration experienced\nby those like the current, third adult generation of\nPalestinian refugees who declare with understandable\ndefiance that they have suffered enough. It is the terror of\nthe innocent victims of bombings; of those who flee from\ncivil war; or of those, such as the people of Kosovo and\nRwanda, who have experienced savage inhumanity. It is the\ndespair of our neighbours in China, Bangladesh and Papua\nNew Guinea, stricken by devastating natural disasters.\nFor many, many millions of people, the end of this\ncentury is not a time for any millennial celebrations. It is\na time of enormous human suffering. As many of us\nremarked at the recent summit of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, at a time when technology presents greater\nopportunity for human development than ever before and\nwhen the power of globalization offers us unique chances\nto work together, how can this possibly be?\nIn trying to answer this question, the Non-Aligned\nMovement recently spoke of a primary need to voice the\nsuffering of the billions it represents. It also spoke of this\nAssembly as the only forum in which that voice can be\nheard with the strength and insistence it deserves.\nThat is why I would like to thank our Secretary-\nGeneral, not just for attending the Non-Aligned summit,\nbut also for displaying heartfelt concern for the special\nproblems faced by developing nations. Above all, I would\nlike to thank him for what I feel is crucial in the\ndeveloping world today, and that is the call he has made\nfor leadership: leadership in ending local hostilities;\nleadership in making peace processes work; and, perhaps\nmost important of all, leadership in summoning the\npolitical will to translate policies made at the national,\nregional or global level into day-to-day real benefits for\nordinary people. It is leadership, in short, aimed at\nencouraging two things: first, tolerance in the acceptance\nof differences and the need to resolve all disputes\npeacefully, no matter how hard this may be; and,\nsecondly, in placing people at the core of policy-making.\n\n\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, the United\nNations is a place where the connection can be made \u2014\none which is so often neglected elsewhere \u2014 between\neconomic and social development on the one hand and\ninternational peace and security on the other. We entirely\nagree with him. His observations reflect the need for us to\naddress not policy positions, but ordinary people\u2019s\nproblems \u2014 jobs, education, food and security \u2014 and to\naddress them from their own perspectives and needs.\nThat is why we very much appreciate the fact that the\nvarious conferences this body has hosted within the last 12\nmonths have been directed towards recognizing people and\ntheir day-to-day concerns. This is also very much in\nagreement with the strong appeal we made last year, when,\nin the context of United Nations reform, we stated that,\nwhatever we do, we have to be sure that nothing weakens\nwhat the United Nations does well for ordinary people. By\nthis I mean its work in the field. It is this which gives the\nOrganization meaning to billions. It is the fundamental\nreason for the existence of the United Nations today, a\nbody founded in the name of \u201cwe the peoples\u201d.\nSo, in commending our Secretary-General\u2019s efforts, I\nwould also like to give him our full support in fulfilling the\npeoples\u2019 need for economic prosperity and social\ndevelopment, and in ensuring that these two concerns\nremain firmly connected. This will place the emphasis in\nthe United Nations on work which will reinforce peace and\nstability, reject violence and confrontation and strengthen\nthe foundation of social development. In other words,\nnothing in the interests of ordinary people can be solved by\nviolence and war. If they have to exist, let the violence be\ndirected against despair and the war be made on suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\ncongratulate Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am\nconfident that with his vast experience and diplomatic skills\nin the service of his country, Uruguay, he will be able to\nsteer our deliberations to a fruitful outcome.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express my\ndelegation\u2019s sincere thanks and appreciation to\nMr. Udovenko, of Ukraine, for the admirable way in which\nhe presided over the last session of the General Assembly.\nThe global situation continues to be in a state of\nflux. Six years after the end of the cold war, the world is\nno more the safe place that we were led to believe it\nwould be. Old conflicts stubbornly persist, while new\nones have emerged.\nThe picture is no better on the disarmament front.\nAlthough the signing of the Convention on landmines is\na laudable achievement in the field of conventional\nweapons, the situation on the nuclear disarmament front\nremains bleak. There has been little or no progress in\nnuclear disarmament. Indeed, the situation has been\naggravated by nuclear tests conducted by two non-\nsignatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), posing a grave challenge to the\ndisarmament process. The international community must\nmake every effort to check further erosion of nuclear\ndisarmament regimes, while strengthening and promoting\nuniversal adherence to them. In this regard, the nuclear\nPowers have a special responsibility.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a\nsource of grave concern. The dismal lack of progress in\nefforts to bring the Palestine-Israel peace process back on\ntrack is a matter of deep disappointment. It portends\nadverse implications for international peace and security.\nLest the positive achievements of recent years be\ndissipated, all parties concerned must exert every effort to\nbuild on the peace agreements that were painstakingly\nnegotiated. Only their continued active engagement in the\npeace process can influence developments in the right\ndirection. It should be stressed, however, that peace and\nstability in the region cannot be attained by delaying and\nfrustrating the realization of the just aspirations of the\nPalestinian people to an independent and sovereign\nhomeland.\nWe are dismayed by the ongoing unresolved conflict\nin Afghanistan. The contending parties must realize that\na long-term solution to the conflict can be reached not\nthrough military means, but through negotiations leading\nto genuine national reconciliation. We call on them to set\naside provincial or sectarian interests, eschew violence\nand seriously pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict,\nin the larger interests of their country and their people.\nWe condemn the violence directed at the personnel of the\nUnited Nations, humanitarian organizations and countries\nconcerned.\nOn a slightly more positive note, Malaysia is pleased\nabout the successful conclusion of the national elections\n2\n\n\nin Cambodia, in which the international community once\nagain played a constructive role. We urge all political\nparties in Cambodia to close ranks and resolve outstanding\nproblems through dialogue, in the larger national interests\nof Cambodia. The objective should be the early formation\nof a Government that fully reflects the wish of the\nCambodian people for national reconciliation, pluralism and\ndevelopment, and which will enable Cambodia to partake\nin constructive regional cooperation with its neighbours.\nRecent events have once again emphasized to the\ninternational community the continuing threat to peace and\nsecurity posed by terrorism. Here I refer in particular to the\nterrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, which resulted in\nthe tragic deaths and injuries of many innocent people.\nMalaysia reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations. Malaysia will join in efforts to\ncombat terrorism through the strengthening of international\ncooperation in various fields on the basis of the supremacy\nof the rule of law. There should be increased cooperation\namong police and other security and law enforcement\nagencies of Member States.\nAt the same time, at the political level, the\ninternational community must work towards inculcating the\nnew global culture of peace that the Secretary-General has\nso eloquently articulated. Malaysia believes that violence\nbegets violence, and the victims will unfortunately be\ninnocent civilians. Indeed, in a world armed with nuclear\nweapons where the danger of nuclear terrorism is ever\npresent, every effort should be made not only to keep\nterrorism at bay through enhanced international cooperation\nbut \u2014 and this is equally important \u2014 to address the root\ncauses. While terrorism may not be entirely eliminated,\nunderstanding the reasons for its continued existence will be\nan important step towards combating it.\nContinued instability in parts of Africa is of major\nconcern to our Organization. Malaysia welcomes the\nincreased attention given to Africa by the United Nations\nand its specialized agencies. Malaysia particularly welcomes\nthe initiative taken by the Security Council to highlight the\nspecial problems of Africa in the Council earlier this year\nand in the Council\u2019s ministerial meeting on African issues\nheld last Thursday, 24 September. Furthermore, Malaysia\nwelcomes and will actively participate in a similar\ndiscussion on Africa at this session of the General\nAssembly. We are convinced that these discussions will\ncontribute to a greater understanding of the interrelated\nproblems of peace, security and development faced by\nmany African countries. Hopefully, they will lead to more\nfocused and coordinated programmes of international action\nto overcome those problems. Given the continuing\ndisadvantaged position of Africa, there is a need for\nsustained efforts on the part of our Organization and its\nspecialized agencies, as well as traditional and new\npartners of Africa, to assist African countries in their\ndevelopment needs. I am pleased to say that Malaysia, for\nits part, has been able to make a modest contribution in\nthese efforts through technical cooperation and trade and\ninvestment in a number of African countries. Malaysia\nwill continue to do so, within its limited resources, in the\nspirit of South-South cooperation and solidarity with\nAfrica.\nAs we grapple with questions of international peace\nand security, we should be equally concerned by the\ncurrent state of the global economy. Indeed, we see that\nthe most imminent threat to the well-being of our region\ntoday is not political, ideological or military, but\neconomic. It is clearly evident that the financial crisis that\ndescended on East Asian countries over a year ago has\nbrought social misery, political instability and economic\nturmoil. In certain countries there is now massive\nunemployment. Economic growth has been severely\ncurtailed, and in fact has contracted. Virtually overnight,\nthe hard-earned gains of decades of hard work, careful\nplanning and prudent management have been wiped out.\nMillions of people in the region most severely affected by\nthe crisis find that their place is now below the poverty\nline. Their right to live a life that is free from the scourge\nof poverty and to have a decent standard of living with\nsome basic necessities has been trampled by the\nmanipulators of the currency markets. Indeed, the super-\nrich have impoverished the poor. It is ironic that this has\nhappened in the year when we celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Though they are pursuing policy responses that\nare in line with International Monetary Fund\nrequirements, the economies of the affected countries\nhave not recovered. Instead, the contagious effects of the\ncrisis have spread to other regions and are affecting the\nworld economy. We may be sliding towards world\nrecession. We may even be on the verge of a global\ndepression if urgent steps are not taken through\ninternational collaboration and cooperation to halt the\nslide and reverse the trend.\nWhile various factors contributed to the crisis, we\nhave no doubt that the financial turmoil was triggered by\nspeculative attacks on the East Asian currencies and the\nresultant reversal of capital flows. The crisis reveals flaws\nin the market mechanism and raises questions about the\nrelative benefits of liberalization and globalization. Unless\n3\n\n\nthese flaws are effectively addressed, the threat of a global\ndepression as devastating as the one that hit the world in\nthe 1930s could confront us. The international community\nhas to act urgently to reform the international financial\nsystem to ensure against massive currency attacks,\nmanipulations and frequently excessive fluctuations.\nIt has been said that the markets would punish those\ncountries which do not possess proper financial structures\nand disciplines and which lack transparency. But the\ninternational financial market itself lacks transparency. In\ntoday\u2019s financial system, currency valued at more than $1.2\ntrillion is bought and sold every 24 hours. This trade is\nlargely carried out without any clear rules, and the very\nGovernments whose currencies are being traded are left to\nfend for themselves in trying to defend the value of their\ncurrencies. There is no system of surveillance, no open\nreporting of any kind and no regulating authority such as\nthe World Trade Organization for this most lucrative trade\nin the coveted commodity that is money itself. It is now\nmost urgent that the international financial market be\nreformed. More than that, significant changes should be\nmade to the international financial architecture.\nMalaysia has been advocating the need for change\nover the last year. Initially, this call went unheeded. In\nSeptember 1997, our Prime Minister said in Hong Kong,\n\u201cA certain degree of uncertainty is fine, but an\nabsolutely uncertain financial world is no good for\nanyone except of course for those who deliberately\ncreate the uncertainty.\u201d\nIt is clear that the situation is becoming increasingly\nuncertain globally. Increasingly, the experts now agree. A\nnumber of Governments also agree. The situation has\nclearly got out of hand. There has to be change and\nimprovement in the international financial architecture.\nThere must be rules to encourage greater transparency.\nFinancial operators must abide by certain internationally\naccepted regulations. They must accept closer supervision\nso as to distinguish between genuine investors and currency\nspeculators. There has to be an earnest effort among\nGovernments to immediately engage in dialogues to revamp\nthe system. We must undertake an immediate collective\neffort to find a comprehensive and workable solution to\nwhat is clearly now a global problem. A few developed\ncountries cannot resolve this problem on their own. A few\ndeveloped countries cannot forever remain rich and\nprosperous if more than two thirds of the world\u2019s countries\nremain poor and socially and politically unstable. This is\nthe time to enter into a genuine process of North-South\ndialogue on an issue of great interest to both. Malaysia\nwelcomes the call by President Clinton for a special\ndiscussion in Washington on the financial and economic\ncrisis that the world is facing today.\nMeanwhile, in the absence of reforms or\ninternationally well-tested formulas or guidelines,\nMalaysia has taken steps to impose currency and capital\ncontrols in order to insulate its economy from currency\nuncertainties while at the same time continuing to be\nactive in international trade and to welcome foreign\ninvestment.\nWhile countries In East Asia are doing their best to\novercome their problems in their respective ways and to\nameliorate the plight of their people, it is important that\nthe lessons of East Asia be learned by the rest of the\ndeveloping world. It is equally important that the\ninternational community find consensus to formulate\nnecessary ground rules to keep in check the rapacious\nnature of financial speculators and manipulators whose\nonly motivation is profit-making and profit-taking. This\nAssembly, and in particular the Economic and Social\nCouncil, can and should also consider this important\nissue. The United Nations can put its moral weight behind\nthe call for regulating these speculative activities in the\ninterest of protecting or insulating vulnerable developing\neconomies.\nIn an increasingly interdependent and borderless\nworld, the globalization of trade and commerce is moving\napace. However, many developing countries can barely\ncope with this, given their weak domestic, economic,\nfinancial and legal structures. Globalization may be\ndesirable and, perhaps, inevitable and unstoppable as a\nprocess and trend. Nevertheless, it is important to realize\nthat unless the developing countries are given time to\nbuild up their structures and are actively assisted in the\nprocess, they will not be able to participate meaningfully\nin global free trade, still less compete with their partners\nfrom the developed world. In such a situation, globalized\nfree trade would be a patently unfair form of world trade,\nwith the odds stacked against developing countries.\nIndeed, it would be a continuing form of exploitation of\nthe weak and poor nations by those that are powerful and\nrich.\nNeedless to say, in the wake of the sad experience\nof the East Asian economies, the faith of many\ndeveloping countries in globalization has been very much\nshaken and diminished. Consequently, many developing\ncountries view the prospect of further liberalizing their\n4\n\n\neconomies with great caution and trepidation. It is\nMalaysia\u2019s conviction that as we approach the new\nmillennium, relations among States should be based on a\nnew paradigm predicated not only on equal sovereignty but\nalso on respect for dignity and mutuality of interests and\nbenefits. Only on that basis will we be able to reap the full\npotential of globalization through genuine international\ndialogue and cooperation.\nThe enjoyment of human rights is one of the most\nimportant principles in the maintenance of justice and peace\nin the world. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights this year affords us an\nopportunity to reflect on both accomplishments and failures\nin realizing the commitments enshrined in the Declaration.\nThe promise in the Declaration to end cruelty and injustice\nstill remains largely unfulfilled. Similarly, the promise to\nprovide a decent living to all has been threatened by the\nnegative effects of globalization and the inadequate\nattention given to economic, social and cultural rights.\nThis fiftieth anniversary coincides with the review of\nthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The\nreview will provide us with an opportunity to make a\nthorough and honest assessment of the successes and\nfailures in implementing the commitments made five years\nago. It would be timely for discussions to focus not only on\nrights but also on obligations. It is imperative that the\nconferment of rights should be linked to the fulfilment of\nobligations and clearly defined duties and responsibilities.\nThe imbalance in emphasis between political and civil\nrights on the one hand and economic, social and cultural\nrights on the other has to be clearly addressed in order for\nthe promotion, protection and enjoyment of all human\nrights to be fully achieved.\nThe right to development, recognized as universal,\ninalienable and an integral part of fundamental human\nrights, has not been fully realized. There is still no effective\ninternational cooperation to create a true environment of\nequitable economic relations which would facilitate the\nrealization of this goal.\nWe may recall that the Secretary-General appropriately\ndesignated the last session of this Assembly as the reform\nAssembly. He tabled his package of reform proposals for\nour consideration and appropriate action. After much\ndebate, many of these proposals were approved and are\nnow in various stages of implementation. It is hoped that\nwith the implementation of the reform package the\nOrganization will become more action-oriented and more\nfocused on and responsive to the needs of Member States.\nCertainly, greater rationalization of the plans and actions\nand more effective management will lead to increased\nefficiency in programme implementation as well as to\nbetter and more effective and efficient utilization of\nhuman resources.\nLet us continue to give our strong support to the\nSecretary-General in his continuing efforts to fully and\neffectively implement his reform proposals. Let us also\nextend our support to his efforts to strengthen the\nOrganization in ways that will benefit all Member States.\nCertainly, a positive contribution in this regard is to\nensure our continued financial support to the\nOrganization, thereby easing its burdens at a time of\nincreasing demands being made upon it. The\nestablishment of the proposed Revolving Credit Fund\nmight help ease the financial crisis of the United Nations\ntemporarily. In the long term, however, the only effective\nway of resolving the problem is through the timely\npayment by Member States of their dues.\nWhat is most disappointing, however, is the lack of\nany progress in an important aspect of the reform of our\nOrganization. I refer to the discussions on the reform and\nrestructuring of the Security Council in the high-level\nWorking Group of the General Assembly. Individual\nMember States, as well as groups of States, have made\nmany important proposals on various aspects of the\nreform and restructuring of the Council, from its\nenlargement and composition to its working methods,\nincluding the use of the veto. Regrettably, all these\nproposals aimed at making the Council more\nrepresentative, democratic, transparent and accountable,\nhave not received the desired consensus.\nClearly what is lacking is not ideas and proposals\nbut the necessary political will on the part of Member\nStates, particularly those with strong views on specific\naspects of reform of the Council. If the reform and\nrestructuring of the Council continue to elude us in its\nsixth year of discussion in the Working Group, we have\nonly ourselves to blame for our inability to demonstrate\nour reasonableness, our goodwill and the necessary\ncompromises required from all of us to break the current\nimpasse. Additional years of continuing with the sterile\ndebate in the Working Group will only increase the\ncreeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among\nMember States, which would be seriously detrimental to\nthe reform process.\nAs its contribution to the reform debate, Malaysia\nreiterates its call for a comprehensive reform and\n5\n\n\nrestructuring of the Security Council. We continue to\nadvocate enlargement of the Council in both categories of\nits membership, permanent and non-permanent,\ncircumscribing, if not totally abolishing, the use of the veto\nand improving the working methods of the Council, which\nshould include increased transparency, accountability and\nparticipation by the larger membership of the Organization\nthrough more open debates on issues of importance to the\ninternational community.\nAs the discussions in the Working Group enter their\nsixth year, it is the earnest hope of my delegation that there\nwill be increased focus, seriousness and urgency on the part\nof Member States in arriving at a consensus. Otherwise, we\nwill lose forever the remaining window of opportunity to\nreform the Council. We should remind ourselves that we do\nnot have the luxury of time and that this opportunity for a\ncomprehensive reform of the Council, if not realized, may\nnot present itself again for many years to come.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate Malaysia\u2019s belief in the\nimportance of these annual debates in the General\nAssembly and their relevance to our continuing efforts to\nenhance international cooperation and collaboration at the\nmultilateral level. The statements by Member States in this\nAssembly serve to inform us and challenge us to further\naction in pursuit of our common goals. In the final analysis,\nthe future viability of the United Nations will depend on the\nperception by Member States of the continued relevance of\nthe United Nations to them and on their continuing support\nfor the Organization.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to express the\npleasure of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas at having\nMr. Opertti preside over the deliberations of this fifty-\nthird session of the General Assembly and to convey to\nhim our warmest congratulations on his election. He may\ncount on the full support of the Bahamas delegation to\nensure the success of this session.\nThe Bahamas also wishes to express its appreciation\nto Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, whose competent\nleadership brought the deliberations of the fifty-second\nsession to a successful conclusion. He has our gratitude.\nOn 10 July of this year, the Commonwealth of the\nBahamas celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary as a\nsovereign nation. Our country is a thriving democracy and\nenjoys one of the highest standards of living in our\nhemisphere. Our economy continues its rebound from\nnegative growth early in the decade, and increasingly we\nare creating the jobs necessary to provide productive\nemployment for our young population in all sectors of the\nBahamian economy.\nOver the past 25 years, the Bahamas has\ndemonstrated a consistently strong and exemplary record\nin upholding democracy, protecting and promoting human\nrights, promoting the advancement of women and\npromoting social development and justice.\nAs a member of the community of nations, the\nBahamas has remained firm in its commitments to the\nUnited Nations and to other international organizations.\nHence, the foreign policy of the Bahamas has been\nmarked by peaceful cooperation and respect for the\nsovereignty of its neighbours.\nNevertheless, we, like many others in the\ninternational community, are constrained to question the\nadequacy of delivery on commitments to improve the\ncircumstances of developing countries. I believe it is fair\nto assert that the United Nations record of achievement in\ndeveloping countries has been, at best, mixed.\nWhile it is true that many developing countries have\ngained a measure of success in their economic and social\nsectors as a direct result of United Nations intervention\nand assistance, too often such successes have been\novershadowed and continue to be overshadowed by\n8\n\n\nserious deficiencies. Too many countries in the developing\nworld today suffer from abject poverty, deteriorating\nenvironments, poor health standards, high unemployment\nrates, staggering levels of malnutrition and hunger,\nspiralling inflation, growing criminal activity and masses of\nhomeless persons displaced by political and economic\nconditions. Such problems and challenges defy the meagre\nresources, both human and financial, of these nations, and\nmany assistance programmes mounted to redress them are\nlimited by their decreasing resources.\nThese are some of the critical areas where the\nOrganization can make a difference in the lives of\nindividuals, especially in developing countries. Another area\nwhere the Organization could make a difference would be\nin the adoption of measures to eradicate the abhorrent\npractice of trafficking in women and children. We call upon\nthe international community to make every effort to address\nthis problem in a comprehensive manner.\nThe Bahamas continues to be challenged by the\nuncontrolled entry of economic migrants to its territory, a\nstruggle which receives scant international recognition or\nassistance, notwithstanding the considerable financial\nburden foisted upon our small developing State. Indeed,\nundue pressure is frequently brought to bear upon our small\nsociety to absorb such economic refugees without regard\nfor the serious social and political consequences of such\nrequests. It is clear that the important United Nations\nconventions crafted to address the problems of political\nrefugees following the Second World War do not\nadequately address the problem of today?s undocumented\neconomic migrants. We call on this Assembly, therefore, to\nbegin to address the need for a review of the mandate of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nThe Bahamas is an archipelago of some 700 islands\nstretched over some 80,000 square miles of ocean. We are\nhome to one of the most important coral reef systems in the\nworld and of important species of flora, fauna and animal\nlife, both terrestrial and marine. Our responsibility to\nconserve and protect our environment for the welfare of\nfuture generations is clear. Equally clear is the fact that we\nrequire continued international assistance if we are to\nsucceed. In this regard, I wish to acknowledge and thank\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP) for its\ncontinuing assistance to the Bahamas as we seek to enhance\nour capacity to catalogue, manage and protect our rich\nbiodiversity; and to thank also the Secretariat of the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change for its\nassistance in improving our response to the challenges\ncreated by climate change and sea level rise.\nIt is important that we begin to deal forthrightly with\nthe obstacles which impede the United Nations from\nplaying as effective a role as it ought, or might, in the\nglobal economy. We must be vigilant against slippage in\nour commitment to the goals of the Organization so\neloquently embodied in our fiftieth anniversary pledge to\nbe a people \u201cunited for a better world\u201c in which the\nhuman condition remained our highest priority. We must\nall accept that the United Nations can only be, and will\nonly be, as successful and responsive as we the Member\nStates allow it to be. The United Nations success is our\nsuccess.\nThe reform measures adopted last session provide a\nuseful platform from which to refocus and improve our\nOrganization. In this regard, the Bahamas welcomes the\nproposals for both a Millennium Assembly and a\nMillennium Forum, so as to forge a closer partnership\nwith civil society.\nThe Bahamas also recognizes and accepts the\nappropriateness of adopting sunset clauses, establishing\ntime limits for United Nations mandates. Given the\nsensitivity of the matter, however, we strongly\nrecommend that final decisions be arrived at on the basis\nof consensus among the Organization?s membership.\nThe Bahamas believes that the Security Council as\ncurrently composed reflects some inequities and\nimbalances of this Organization. A living organization\nmust adapt to changing circumstances if it is to remain\nrelevant. A Security Council reflecting the eminence of\npost-Second World War Powers cannot be expected to\nadequately address concerns of our post-colonial world.\nAs we approach a new millennium, it would be in our\ninterest for this central organ of our Organization to be\nmore reflective of our present reality.\nAs a peace-loving nation, and one in which respect\nfor human dignity has historically been upheld, the\nBahamas condemns terrorism in all its forms. Such\nwanton acts are inhumane and wreak havoc on entire\ncommunities. It is for these reasons that the Bahamas will\ncontinue to lend its support to all legitimate national and\ninternational efforts to stem the spread of terrorism and to\nwork towards its elimination.\nTo this end, we will continue to cooperate with the\ninternational community to bring the perpetrators of\nterrorism to justice, as well as to address comprehensively\nthe root causes of terrorism. We call on all Members to\nact similarly.\n9\n\n\nWe wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\nhis untiring efforts in the promotion of international peace\nand security. Unfortunately, his recent reports on trouble\nspots around the world continue to reveal a disturbing\npicture. In a world shrunken by globalization, every trouble\nspot has the potential to affect us all. Our energies, exerted\nin search of real solutions to these global crises, must\ntherefore match those expended in pursuit of responses to\nour national challenges. Let us seek to mark the fiftieth\nanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping with an\nenlightened breakthrough in this area.\nThe continued production and use of land mines\ninternationally continues to maim and kill thousands of\ninnocent men, women and children in developing countries.\nThe Bahamas abhors these actions. We were pleased to join\nthe more than 100 countries which have signed the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction, which we have also now ratified. We\ncall upon all Member States that have not done so, to do\nthe same.\nThe Bahamas is seriously concerned by the\nproliferation of handguns and other weapons which\ncontinue to infiltrate small island developing States. The\nuse of these conventional weapons by perpetrators of crime\nconsiderably raises the level of violence in our societies and\nthreatens our social, economic and political fibre.\nWe call on countries manufacturing handgun and other\nweapons to assume greater responsibility over the sale and\nexport of such weapons, and to strengthen their\ninternational collaborative efforts to combat this problem.\nFor our part, we have joined Member States of this\nhemisphere in acceding to and ratifying the Inter-American\nConvention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and\nTrafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other\nRelated Materials. We commend similar action to all\nMember States of this body.\nThe Bahamas, after experiencing an abatement in the\nillicit transit and traffic in narcotic drugs through its\nterritory, regrets to inform the Assembly that it is again\nconfronted with this scourge. Drug seizure quantity and\nfrequency have increased, and the numbers of persons\narrested and charged with drug offences are similarly\nincreasing. Past experience has taught us that this is not a\nproblem which can be resolved by any single State.\nInternational cooperation is critical if this menace is to be\ncontrolled.\nNotably, we welcomed the recent twentieth special\nsession of the General Assembly on the world?s drug\nproblem. That session adopted important decisions\ndesigned to chart the future course in the international\nfight to combat the supply, traffic and consumption of\nillicit drugs. It is now imperative that Member States\ncommit themselves to the implementation of those\ndecisions.\nThe past 12 months have been a period of turmoil\nfor the world?s economy, marked in particular by the\ncrippling financial crisis in South-East Asia. The fallout\nfrom that crisis is now being felt, in varying degrees,\nglobally.\nWe have, from time to time, in this forum\nunderscored the importance of establishing a sustainable\nand equitable international framework for highly\nintegrated global markets. This need remains critical,\nparticularly in the light of the quickening pace of the\nglobalization of production and of capital flows, and the\nliberalization of trade since early in this decade. Clearly,\nthese developments have not provided equal opportunities\nfor all countries to share in the benefits of globalization.\nCountries \u2014 developing countries, least developed\ncountries and countries with economies in transition \u2014\nought to be assisted in their efforts to become integrated\ninto the mainstream global economy, without incurring\ndisruptive and punitive economic, social and cultural\ncosts. These are matters of survival for small economies\nlike that of the Bahamas.\nQuestions are now being raised concerning the\nadequacy of the international financial system to meet the\ngrowing demands of the world?s diverse economies. My\nGovernment is acutely aware that, while private capital\nflows have played an indispensable role in the\nadvancement of developing economies, they should not be\nrelied upon as the single source of financing for capital\ndevelopment. In this connection, the Bahamas notes the\nrecent call for a high-level international intergovernmental\nforum on financing for development aimed at furthering\nthe global partnership for development.\nMy Government supports this call and applauds the\nAssembly?s efforts to explore the matter further by\nsoliciting input from Member States. We call on this body\nto address the issue in as comprehensive and integrated a\nmanner as possible.\n10\n\n\nMy Government was also pleased to note the\nconvening, in December last, of the expert group meeting\non vulnerability indices here at the United Nations. It is my\nGovernment?s fervent hope that work will continue in this\nimportant area. As the Assembly is aware, the Bahamas has\non many occasions repeated its objection to the use of per\ncapita income as the sole, or principal, measuring tool for\nthe economies of developing countries. This yardstick does\nnot, and cannot, take into account the special circumstances\nof countries like the Bahamas, with our archipelagic make-\nup, our ecological fragility and our economic vulnerability.\nYet these are all integral measures of our state of\ndevelopment.\nMy Government looks forward to the upcoming\nreview in 1999 of the Barbados Programme of Action, and\nhopes that all issues of concern to small island developing\nStates will be addressed in line with the chapters of the\nProgramme of Action.\nThe vision of our United Nations to meet the needs of\nour people is achievable, but only if our purposes and\nprinciples are designed for the common good rather than\nfor narrow nationalistic objectives. Otherwise, such motives\nwill inevitably produce inadequate programmes and\nadversely affect relationships.\nThe lessons of history no longer take centuries to be\ndeduced. They present themselves starkly before us, often\nin our own lifetime. Will we choose to learn from them?\nThe answer lies with each of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation, I should first of all like to\ncongratulate Mr. Opertti warmly on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. My\ncountry, the Republic of Guinea, is pleased with this\nexpression of confidence, eloquent proof of the international\ncommunity?s recognition of the very positive role played by\nhis country, Uruguay, in working for the noble ideals of our\nOrganization. I am sure his personal qualities and great\nexperience will ensure success at this session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to convey\nour great appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession, for the skill, open-mindedness and efficiency of his\npresidency.\nI should also like to extend to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, the confidence of the Government of\nGuinea, which greatly appreciates his perceptiveness, his\ngreat wisdom and his hard work, which together are\nopening up new horizons for this Organization.\nDespite encouraging results in many areas, the United\nNations still faces many challenges that threaten\ninternational peace and security and jeopardize the\nsustainable development of nations. It is the responsibility\nof the United Nations, in accordance with its purposes and\nprinciples, to become more involved in the enduring search\nfor peace, so that the human race, on the eve of the third\nmillennium, can establish a real foundation for the\nprosperity of all States.\nHow can one ensure peace and the harmonious\ndevelopment of our States if the international community\nwill not firmly commit itself to identifying and eradicating\nthe deep causes of the many conflicts and imbalances that\ncontinue to impede mankind?s progress towards greater\nwell-being? At a time when we are preparing to\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the world?s conscience is\nstill troubled by the indifference of the major players in\nthe international arena in the search for appropriate\nsolutions to the challenges that face us all.\nIn a number of countries, peoples and individuals are\ndeprived of fundamental rights. Civil wars continue to\ncause great suffering to innocent victims. It has been\nshown that respect for fundamental rights, including\npromotion of the right to development, which underlies all\nother rights, is an excellent instrument of preventive\ndiplomacy today.\nOur session is opening at a time when the Middle\nEast peace process is completely deadlocked. My country\nis following with great concern recent developments in\nthat part of the world, particularly in the Arab territories\noccupied by Israel. My delegation is convinced that unless\nthe rights of all the interested parties are taken into\naccount, peace will remain elusive.\nThe search for peace in the Middle East is a matter\nof concern to all States, first and foremost the States\nmembers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference\n(OIC), which on several occasions has called on the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly for greater\nUnited Nations involvement in achieving a just and\nlasting peace in the Middle East through the return of the\noccupied Arab territories, the creation of a Palestinian\nstate and respect for the rights of all States in the region\nto peace and security.\nMy delegation appeals to all parties concerned,\nparticularly the authorities in Tel Aviv, to ensure strict\nimplementation of the Oslo and Washington agreements,\nwith a view to saving peace and thereby avoid the threat\nof another crisis that jeopardizes the balance in the\nsubregion and international peace as a whole.\nThe African continent continues to be a central\nconcern of the international community. There is no need\nfor me to enumerate the many internal conflicts that have\noccurred in Africa in recent years.\nIn West Africa, the collective awareness of the\nmember States of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) of the need to make our\nsubregion a zone of peace, security and stability has\n15\n\n\ncontributed, thanks to the resolve shown by our heads of\nState, to restoring peace in Liberia and has allowed for a\nreturn to constitutionality in Sierra Leone.\nThese achievements, which are the result of the\nunanimous desire of our peoples to manage their own\naffairs, also attest to the vitality of the institutions of\nregional integration as instruments for conflict prevention,\nmanagement and resolution. Here, I would appeal to the\ninternational community for more cooperation with and\nassistance to the peacekeeping mechanisms initiated by\nsubregional organizations.\nThere is a need to consolidate the great achievements\nof the restoration of peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone\nthrough massive assistance for their speedy reconstruction,\nthe return of refugees and national reconciliation. If the\nyoung people who have been demobilized in these two\ncountries do not quickly find some activity in civilian life,\nthe temptation to return to disorder will remain. To\nstrengthen peace and security in the West African\nsubregion, the international community must help the\neconomies of Liberia and Sierra Leone return to the path of\ngrowth.\nWhile ECOWAS and the international community\nwere seeking ways and means to consolidate peace in\nSierra Leone and Liberia, another conflict erupted on 7\nJune 1998 in Guinea-Bissau. The Government of Guinea,\nwhich has always advocated dialogue and consultation to\nresolve conflicts, expressed, from the beginning of this\ncrisis, its grave concern because of the geographic,\nhistorical, social and cultural ties uniting Guinea-Bissau and\nmy own country.\nThe existence of a mutual defence assistance pact,\nsigned on 25 January 1980, and the explicit invitation by\nthe Guinea-Bissau?s democratically elected President,\nPresident Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira both justified the sending of\na Guinean contingent to Guinea-Bissau to preserve\nconstitutional order and help end the war. Faithful to our\npolicy of peace and dialogue, the Government of Guinea\nhas been working since the beginning of this crisis in the\nECOWAS Committee of Seven to find a just, negotiated\nsolution.\nWe believe that complementary action by the\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\ncontact group of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\nCountries will make it possible for us to achieve the\nobjective of restoring peace and security in Guinea-Bissau.\nIf we are to preserve the achievements of\ndemocratization in Africa, the international community\nmust adopt new, more binding legal instruments\nprohibiting any seizure of power by force and banishing\nthose responsible for such actions at the international,\nregional and subregional levels. The implementation of\nsuch measures will help to strengthen preventive\ndiplomacy and to preserve peace and security within our\nStates, with respect for fundamental human rights.\nI cannot end this section of my statement without\nmentioning the thorny issue of refugees and displaced\npersons, who are the victims of these crises. My country,\nthe Republic of Guinea, because of its geographic location\namong three countries facing civil war, has of all the\ncountries in the world the highest proportion of refugees\nwithin its territory. Over the last decade, Guinea has taken\nin more than 700,000 refugees, which is one tenth of our\npopulation. This massive and prolonged concentration of\npeople has had serious social, economic and\nenvironmental consequences in the areas of Guinea\nconcerned, and is weighing heavily on my country and its\neconomy.\nI would like to reiterate here the appeal made by the\nGovernment of Guinea for substantial assistance, in\naccordance with Security Council and ECOWAS\nresolutions to help the Republic of Guinea bear the\nburden of these refugees. On behalf of the Government of\nGuinea, I should like to express our gratitude to those\nStates that have already responded favourably to this\nappeal.\nConcerned about the situation, the United Nations\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme organized a special meeting on\nthe Republic of Guinea on 9 and 10 July this year in New\nYork. The Government of Guinea appreciated this\nwelcome initiative by the Secretary-General. We greatly\nappreciated the recognition by the international\ncommunity, through the United Nations system, of the\ngreat sacrifices made by the people of Guinea to help the\nrefugees from neighbouring countries, and especially the\nwill of the United Nations system to mobilize resources\nto strengthen Guinea?s economic capacity and preserve its\nstability, so that we can continue to be a small island of\npeace and prosperity.\nI should like to take this opportunity to urge\nmultilateral partners, all our partners, to continue to\npursue with us the activities undertaken in support of\nGuinea, particularly in the area of the environment, which\n16\n\n\nhas been seriously degraded by the long-term mass\npresence of refugees. The future of the water supplies of\nWest Africa is at stake here.\nThe Republic of Guinea is closely following recent\ndevelopments in the political situation in the Great Lakes\nregion, particularly the crisis in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. My delegation is deeply concerned by the risk\nthat the conflict will spill over into the subregion. We\nurgently appeal to all the parties to the conflict to call an\nimmediate ceasefire and to respect the territorial integrity of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with\nthe recommendations of the summit of heads of State of the\nsubregion held at Victoria Falls on 7 and 8 September this\nyear.\nPromoting the right to development is part of the\noverall search for greater prosperity for the human race.\nWhile tangible political progress has been made in Africa\nover the last decade, African States still face the challenge\nof development, indebtedness and the negative impact of a\nglobalization which is not yet fully understood.\nThis terrible situation, aggravated by the negative\nimpact of internal conflict, is significantly weakening our\nStates and opening them up to new and dangerous forms of\nforeign greed. The implementation of a policy to gradually\nreduce the imbalances between rich and developing\ncountries would contribute to the emergence of a true\nglobal market by the creation of centres of development on\nall continents.\nEach country in the world should be given every\nopportunity for development and helped to become part of\nthe world trade system. Despite considerable efforts by\nAfrican countries towards political and economic\nrestructuring, and towards strengthening their credibility and\nmaking their economies more competitive, the economic\nsituation in Africa continues to be critical. If urgent and\nappropriate measures are not taken, the sacrifices made risk\nhaving been in vain.\nMy Government has already undertaken far-reaching\npolitical, economic and structural reforms and hopes that\nspecial attention will be given to the situation in Africa. We\nappeal to the international community and the developed\ncountries to continue to increase official development\nassistance. Sustained assistance to African countries will\nenable them to consolidate what they have already achieved\nand thereby to enter the next millennium with a greater\nsense of calm. In this respect, the Agenda for Development\nshould be strongly supported, with a view to its effective\nimplementation.\nThe question of disarmament and the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is still a\nconcern for my Government. While the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a significant\nstep forward for the preservation of peace, recent\ndevelopments in the international arena require the\ninternational community as a whole to consider more\ndeeply the underlying causes of the nuclear arms race. It\nseems clear that as long as imbalances and injustices are\nnot put right, the spectre of proliferation will continue to\nthreaten international peace.\nCountries that already possess nuclear weapons have\na special responsibility for the preservation of\ninternational peace and must shoulder their responsibilities\nby taking a more active part in strengthening prevention\nand peacekeeping mechanisms, resolving existing or latent\nconflicts, ensuring more equitable treatment for States\ninvolved in conflict and, finally, making a more\nsubstantial contribution to the development of less\nfortunate nations.\nThe Government of Guinea believes that only\ngeneral and complete disarmament can prevent the risk of\nproliferation. In the subregion of West Africa, the trade\nin small arms endangers the internal equilibrium of our\nStates. Within the context of conflict prevention in West\nAfrica, subregional cooperation is under way to eradicate\nthis scourge. We invite the other regions of Africa to\nsupport this initiative and to work to establish appropriate\nstructures in order to put an end to the illicit trade in\nsmall arms and make Africa a zone of peace and security.\nThe Republic of Guinea welcomes the adoption and\nsigning of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction. The National Assembly\nof Guinea has already ratified this important Convention\nto show its support for the elimination of landmines,\nwhich cause so much suffering to innocent victims.\nIt is reassuring to note the greater awareness at the\nglobal level of the need to end drug-trafficking, whose\nmany consequences dangerously threaten the prosperity of\nnations. The results of the recent world summit meeting\non drugs will doubtless enable us to further refine our\nmethods to combat the production, distribution, sale and\nconsumption of drugs, which are a real scourge.\n17\n\n\nThe recent adoption in Rome of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court was a major milestone in the\nprogress of humankind towards the elimination of serious\nviolations of humanitarian law committed during\ninternational or internal conflicts.\nAs our community prepares to enter the third\nmillennium, it is now more necessary than ever to adapt the\nUnited Nations to the requirements of international life. The\nnew challenges facing us will require the adoption of new,\nmore appropriate arrangements to make the twenty-first\ncentury one of peace, justice and prosperity within the\ncontext of an equitable partnership that is beneficial to all\nnations.\nMy delegation is convinced that the United Nations is\nstill the melting pot in which all nations can make their\nvoices heard in the search for just and lasting solutions to\ntheir concerns. We therefore believe that the financial\ncapacity of the United Nations must be strengthened.\nContributions must be paid on time and in accordance with\nthe established scale. To that end, we must, together,\nreview the way in which the United Nations system\nfunctions with a view to adapting it to current and future\ncircumstances.\nMy delegation believes in the need for the\ndemocratization of the United Nations through the\nrestructuring of its principal bodies, such as the Security\nCouncil, whose current membership reflects the state of the\nworld in 1945 and no longer corresponds to the political,\neconomic and social realities of the world today. The\nreform of the principal bodies of our Organization must\nenable all States to use their national capacities to seek and\nconsolidate international peace.\nMy country is more committed than ever to the\nhonourable mission of our Organization as set forth in the\nCharter. Given the many challenges facing us, Guinea\nbelieves in the need for all of us to work together to\nstrengthen and preserve humankind?s vision of justice,\nfreedom, peace and solidarity. That is what our peoples\nwould have us do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first associate\nmyself with the statement by my colleague, the Austrian\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the European\nUnion.\nWe embark upon this session of the General Assembly\nin the midst of challenges that affect all continents. We can\ndeal with those challenges only if we display resolve and a\ncommon vision.\nThat vision, clear and simple, is enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations. We must strive to maintain\ninternational peace and security, respect for human rights\nand dignified living conditions for all. Every State joining\nthe United Nations has committed itself to that vision.\nTo realize our vision, the rule of law must prevail. We\nbase our national societies on the rule of law, and much is\nmade of the rule of law within our societies. The rule of\nlaw offers the strongest defense against arbitrary exercise\nof power, but we sometimes neglect its importance in the\ninternational context.\nMy call for greater commitment to the rule of law\ninternationally is not meant to belittle the progress made.\nThe Charter has inspired an impressive body of specific\ntreaty law governing the behaviour of States. Laws on\nhuman rights, disarmament, the environment and outer\nspace, and the law of the sea and international trade law\nare important examples.\nWe celebrate this year the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by\nthe General Assembly in December 1948. The\nDeclaration covers civil and political rights, as well as\neconomic, social, and cultural rights. It has had an\nimmense impact upon the standard-setting work of the\nUnited Nations and within each Member State.\nHuman rights are universal. They must be\nguaranteed to all persons without discrimination and\nobserved by all countries irrespective of their form of\ngovernment. That is the essence of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Indeed, it would be\ncontradictory to talk about human rights if they were not\naccorded to all human beings, wherever they live.\nTo deny the universality of human rights is to deny\nour common humanity. Freedom from torture, for\nexample, must be respected everywhere, regardless of\nlocal traditions or local problems. Obviously, situations\ndiffer, but the human rights foundation is the same\neverywhere.\nAll States in Vienna in 1993 reaffirmed that the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights constitutes a\ncommon standard of achievement for all peoples and all\nnations. All States further proclaimed that the promotion\nand protection of human rights is a legitimate concern of\nthe international community.\nA feature of present-day international law is that, by\nnow, we have almost all the standards against which to\nhold Governments accountable for their acts. What we are\nstill missing is an effective international machinery to\nensure the implementation of all the rules in practice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nto move from declarations to deeds. I wish to pay special\ntribute to the many human rights defenders who struggle\nin the front line for the defence of our common human\nvalues, often at the greatest personal risk.\n15\n\n\nIt is a most proper contribution by the United Nations\nto adopt this year a declaration for the protection of the\nwork of human rights defenders, those who strive to realize\nthe solemn pledges contained in the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights.\nWe also warmly welcome the progress made in firmly\nestablishing the rights of indigenous peoples.\nAnother landmark contribution was achieved this year\nthrough the historic adoption in Rome of a Statute for a\npermanent International Criminal Court. Time and again,\nwe have observed the failure of national criminal law\nsystems to punish the perpetrators of atrocities and those\nbehind them. The shocking events from Cambodia, the\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and now Kosovo and\nelsewhere are fresh on our minds.\nThe prospects for reconciliation and lasting peace are\nundermined if the perpetrators remain at large. A key\nobjective of the International Criminal Court is exactly to\nrestore the rule of law and end impunity. This is a matter\nnot only of justice, but also of peace and security. The ad\nhoc Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have\nbeen an important first step, but only a preliminary step.\nWe need a permanent institution.\nDenmark urges all States to ratify the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. It is an urgent task to set this\nhistoric building block in the construction of international\nsociety in place. In light of experiences gained, the door is\nopen for adjusting the functioning of the Court to the needs\nof the world community. The review clause in the\nStatute \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a proposition strongly advocated by Denmark all\nalong in the negotiations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d assures that.\nThe signature in December last year in Ottawa by 121\nStates of the Convention to ban the use and production of\nanti-personnel landmines has established a very important\nnorm in international humanitarian law. For too long has\nthis inhumane, indiscriminate weapon been allowed to\nclaim thousands of innocent civilian victims every year. We\nwelcome the entry into force of the Convention by 1 March\n1999. Let us now intensify our joint efforts to clear the\nmany mines already in the ground. Denmark offers its\ncontinued support.\nA most disturbing factor in the international legal\norder are the terrorist attacks taking innocent lives and\njeopardizing relations among States. The international\ncommunity must continue to condemn all acts, methods and\npractices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable under\nall circumstances, wherever and by whomsoever committed.\nNo ends justify such means, but, apparently,\ncondemnation is not enough. We need to further\nstrengthen international cooperation to prevent, combat\nand eliminate terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. There must be no safe haven for terrorists.\nThose responsible for terrorist acts must be brought to\njustice. If traditional extradition agreements cannot bring\nabout such a result, less traditional arrangements must be\ncontemplated, as envisaged in regard to the horrendous\nterrorist bombing over Lockerbie.\nIn May this year, India, regrettably, decided to\nresume nuclear testing after 24 years of self-imposed\nrestraint. Pakistan, regrettably, followed India\u00e2s lead and\nconducted its own tests for the first time. These tests not\nonly contradict the non-test norm that had developed over\nthe past two years. They also endanger peace and stability\nin the region and internationally. Therefore, the nuclear\ntesting by India and Pakistan is of legitimate concern to\nthe international community.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons enjoys almost universal support. A substantial\nnumber of countries have ratified the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and more are following every\nmonth. These two Treaties are the cornerstones of the\ninternational non-proliferation regime and the foundation\nfor the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. I urge those\ncountries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including India and Pakistan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that have not\nyet done so, to sign and move to ratify these Treaties\nwithout condition.\nThis year marks the first half-century of United\nNations peacekeeping. The first mission was established\n50 years ago, based on the goals of the United Nations\nCharter. Since then, United Nations peacekeeping has\ndeveloped norms and principles of its own: consent of the\nparties, impartiality and non-use of force. These principles\ncontinue to guide the international community\u00e2s efforts in\nsecuring peace and stability on all continents.\nPeacekeeping operations are an important illustration\nof the resolve of the international community, represented\nby the United Nations. Their successes are real. In the\nMiddle East and Cyprus, the United Nations has been a\nsource of stability for many years. In Mozambique,\nUnited Nations peacekeepers have demobilized thousands\nof combatants and made room for democratic elections.\nIn the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the\n16\n\n\nUnited Nations preventive deployment remains an essential\nstabilizing factor. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina today,\nthe United Nations is responsible for the crucial task of\ntraining and restructuring local police forces.\nDenmark has a long tradition of contributing to United\nNations peacekeeping operations. Danish forces took part\nfrom the very beginning and have served the United\nNations faithfully for the last five decades. In recent years,\nDanish forces have served all over the world, from the\nMiddle East to the Balkans, as well as in Asia and in\nAfrica.\nToday\u00e2s peacekeeping challenges differ from those of\nearlier decades and much work has been done to adjust the\nUnited Nations to the new challenges. Denmark has taken\nan active part in the process. Together with other countries,\nDenmark aims to improve the United Nations capacity for\nrapid reaction within the framework of the standby system.\nDenmark is also engaged in the creation of a new\npeacekeeping capacity of the Baltic States and of southern\nAfrica.\nThe demand for adjustment and reform continues.\nThere is still work to be done in areas such as preplanning\nand logistic support. But peacekeeping goes beyond military\noperations. A broader, integrated approach involving\ncomponents such as civilian police, preventive diplomacy\nand humanitarian assistance is called for. Such conceptual\nflexibility will add to the strength of United Nations\npeacekeeping.\nWe, the United Nations Members, must be ready to\nmeet our obligations and equip the Organization with the\nnecessary tools for these future challenges. We must also,\nof course, ensure the safety of personnel working for the\nUnited Nations.\nWe are witnessing an enhanced role for regional\norganizations. Their special expertise has proved valuable\nin addressing causes of conflict and establishing a basis for\nsettlement. The Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe is a good example.\nA division of labour between organizations is\nnecessary, but it must not lead to confusion in leadership\nand responsibility. The United Nations remains the core\ninstitution in the international legal order and must maintain\na central role in international efforts to ensure peace and\nsecurity.\nWe are approaching the twenty-first century, a\ncentury in which international society also should be\ngoverned by the rule of law. The norms of international\nlaw are universal but, sadly, they are not always\nuniversally respected.\nRespect for national sovereignty cannot be invoked\nas an excuse to avoid the obligations of international\ncooperation and international law. International criticism\nof violations of human rights and of international\nhumanitarian law is fully legitimate.\nThe role of the United Nations in this respect\nremains crucial. Indeed, direct intervention by the\ninternational community through the United Nations can\nbe fully justified and legitimate, including in grave cases\nof humanitarian law being violated.\nRespect for the rule of law in international relations\ncan be ensured only if the international community and\nthe United Nations possess the instruments and the\nresolve to act. In this respect, regrettably, we must note\na certain paralysis in recent years in the face of grave\nhumanitarian conflicts and emergencies.\nDisagreement among Member States on how to deal\nwith a particular crisis weakens the resolve of the United\nNations to act. But we must, unfortunately, also note a\nlack of general support for the United Nations in certain\nquarters. The least we can expect from Members is for\nthem to make the necessary resources available for the\nOrganization, inter alia, by paying their contributions in\nfull, on time and without conditions.\nWe must find ways which enhance the ability of the\nUnited Nations to deal with violations of international\npeace and security and other serious breaches of\ninternational law. Failure to act on such challenges is\nmorally indefensible and betrays the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nViolations and breaches must be met convincingly,\nwith resolve and with the legitimacy of international law.\nLegitimacy will usually be provided by the Security\nCouncil. That is how it should be. Disagreement in the\nSecurity Council about a particular line of action must,\nhowever, never lead to the paralysis of the international\ncommunity.\nIf, for instance, members of the Security Council\ncannot agree on a mandate for a peace operation, they\nmust allow for other possibilities for effective action.\n17\n\n\nWhen faced with an urgent agenda, the option should not\nbe action or no action, but what line of action.\nThere will usually be a broad range of actions\navailable for the international community. It is a question\nof choice and political will. It does not suffice to leave\neverything to the humanitarian agencies. Emergency relief,\nhowever necessary, is not a substitute for political action.\nA reform of the Security Council can serve to\nstrengthen the authority of the Council. But in the end we\ndepend on the readiness of the members of the Council to\nact and to apply the same yardstick to all cases.\nI should also like to emphasize the role and\nprerogatives of the Secretary-General in the field of peace\nand security. The Secretary-General has exercised these\nfunctions in a highly commendable way.\nBefore concluding, I wish to refer to the normative\nrole of the United Nations as an important aspect of the\nrule of law. In particular, the United Nations conferences of\nthe past decade have set valuable norms for improving\nliving conditions for mankind. Common standards have\nbeen set in such important areas as eradication of poverty,\nenvironmentally sustainable development, gender equality\nand promotion and protection of human rights.\nAchievements have been made in meeting these\nstandards, but much remains to be done. The responsibility\nfalls both to Member States and to the international\ninstitutions. The United Nations system must ensure, on its\npart, an effective and coordinated follow-up to the global\nUnited Nations conferences.\nIt is our collective responsibility to ensure that the\nfinancial resources are provided to attain these common\nstandards. Denmark will continue to contribute development\nassistance in the amount of 1 per cent of our gross national\nproduct.\nLet me conclude by expressing my conviction that the\nbest way to promote the rule of law in international\nrelations is through respect for democratic norms in our\nown societies.\nThe norm-setting activities of the United Nations have\ngiven an indispensable impetus towards democratization and\ngood governance. Assistance to the establishment of\ndemocratic institutions in developing countries and\ncountries with economies in transition can also make an\nimportant contribution. This is an overriding objectives of\nDenmark\u00e2s considerable assistance to those countries.\nWhatever challenges we face to the international\nlegal order, we must never fail in our determination to\nfollow the words of the preamble of the Charter:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I have the pleasure of congratulating you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\nyour wide-ranging expertise in international affairs will\nfacilitate your task and lead the deliberations of this\nsession to a successful conclusion. I should like also to\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his\nwise leadership and invaluable contributions during the\npreceding session of the Assembly. Nor can I fail to\nexpress our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\nefforts he is exerting to enhance the role of the United\nNations in international affairs.\nFollowing the end of the cold war a decade ago,\nmany, especially in the countries of the North, believed\nthat this planet, which is home to approximately 6 billion\npeople, was going to become a more stable, secure and\nprosperous world. That conviction proceeded from the\nnotion that the bi-polar system was unable to achieve\ninternational security except in the framework of a\nbalance of terror. Nor was the old system able to resolve\nregional conflicts due to competition for areas of\ninfluence.\nThe question now before the international\ncommunity is the following: were these convictions\njustified? Or did wishful thinking leapfrog reality,\nignoring the following salient facts?\nFirst, nuclear weapons, which are unparalleled in\ntheir destructive capability, have proliferated since the end\nof the cold war and have now reached India and Pakistan.\nThis proliferation has also gained a sort of legitimacy\nbased on the fact that Israel?s possession of nuclear\nweapons was not spoken of during the 1995 Review and\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My country,\nSyria, Arab countries and most countries in the Non-\nAligned Movement appealed to the five nuclear-weapon\nStates during the review and extension conferences for\nthis Treaty not to exempt any country from adhering to\nthis Treaty, so that the world will not face a new nuclear\narms race. Unfortunately that urgent call fell on deaf ears.\nThose who now assume that nuclear-arms proliferation\nwill be limited to a few countries are mistaken. Syria and\n10\n\n\nall Arab countries call for turning the Middle East into a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone, as a serious contribution to\nhalting the nuclear-arms race.\nSecondly, in the post-cold-war era regional conflicts\nhave multiplied, becoming more fierce, and with varying\nforms and motives. This has happened to such an extent\nthat the United States, which is now the only super-Power\nin a unipolar world, and the Security Council, the body\nresponsible for maintaining international peace and security,\nare no longer able to contain these conflicts, let alone find\njust solutions to them. Anyone who reads the statement\nissued by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five\npermanent members of the Security Council, issued at the\nbeginning of this session of the General Assembly, will\nhave a headache and will be severely frustrated at seeing\nthis world face so many regional conflicts and so many\ncomplicated crises without any light at the end of the\ntunnel.\nThirdly, we have the recent economic and financial\ncrises in the world, particularly following the collapse of\nfinancial markets in South-East Asia and the accompanying\nsharp decline in the prices of raw materials, especially oil.\nAll of this has proven that economic globalization is a two-\nedged sword and has repercussions which cannot be\nconfined to those countries tantalized by rapid prosperity\ngenerated by an inflow of capital and foreign investments.\nRather, such effects go beyond those countries to the\ncountries exporting capital and investments, which were\nalso tempted by quick profits without paying much heed to\nthe consequences.\nWhat is going on in the world now under the banner\nof globalization is a cause for concern, because it gives\npriority to profit over other development factors: economic,\nsocial, cultural and environmental. It also strives to confine\nthe role of the State to providing guarantees and protection\nto major market forces, ignoring the responsibility for the\nachievement of social justice for the peoples. Furthermore,\nthe continuing marginalization of developing countries in\ninternational economic decision-making and the continuing\nsevere restrictions on access by such countries to\ninternational markets and financial and technological\nresources render these countries unable to benefit from the\npromised opportunities of globalization.\nStrengthening development indicators and increasing\nlevels of productivity are the more durable means of\nlimiting the effects of economic crises and reducing the\neffects of financial upheavals, especially in developing\ncountries. At any rate, we believe that such crises and\nshake-ups may happen from time to time and may touch\nevery country, no matter how immune it may seem, so\nlong as the most powerful and prevalent monetary unit in\nthe world \u2014 the United States dollar \u2014 is not stable.\nHowever, the imminent issuance of a European monetary\nunit may contribute to establishing a more stable\ninternational financial and economic system.\nIn any case, we believe there is no alternative to\nopening a serious dialogue within the framework of the\nUnited Nations between developing and developed\ncountries and international monetary institutions in order\nto lay a solid foundation for international cooperation\nwhich might save the world from economic surprises and\nsocial upheavals and also contribute positively to the\ninterests of all countries in the world, in the South as well\nas the North.\nSince its beginning, the Arab-Israeli conflict has\nbeen given high priority on the agenda of the international\ncommunity. International efforts to contain this conflict\nhave been unrelenting every time it has exploded, because\nthe Middle East, with its singular strategic position, its\ntremendous material and spiritual wealth and its renowned\ncultural heritage can be considered the most sensitive\nparameter for measuring the state of world peace and\nsecurity.\nThe peace process that was launched in Madrid was\nseen as a new beginning to settle this conflict with the\nend of the cold war. The Madrid terms of reference, the\nAmerican assurances and the results reached constituted\na firm basis which cannot be ignored under any\ncircumstance.\nThe insistence of the Israeli Prime Minister on\npursuing a policy hostile to peace and his rejection of the\nrights of the Arabs to regain the occupied territories under\nthe pretext of security for Israel alone \u2014 at a time when\nIsrael?s military arsenal is considered one of the mightiest\nand most modern in the world \u2014 constitute a challenge\nnot only to the Arabs, but also to the will of the\ninternational community as a whole.\nIt seems clear that Israel does not limit its\nconception of security to the Arab territories it occupies;\nrather it is working to establish a military alliance in the\nregion which will undermine the peace process and put\nthe region on a path fraught with dangers, tension and the\npotential for explosion.\n11\n\n\nWhat the region and its peoples need is not the\nestablishment of alliances and axes but the establishment of\na just and comprehensive peace, based on the full\nwithdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan to the\nline of 4 June 1967 and from the south of Lebanon and its\nwestern Bekaa, in implementation of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. In\naddition, the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian\npeople must be safeguarded, including their right to self-\ndetermination and the establishment of their independent\nState on their national territory.\nThe peace process faces a real crisis. It has been in a\nstalemate on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks for over two\nyears. It faces erosion on the Palestinian track, as well, due\nto Israeli intransigence. The entire peace process is on the\nwane and will be so long as the Israeli Government rejects\nthe principle of land for peace and attempts to impose on\nthe Arabs a peace based on occupation and settlerism.\nHowever, Syria has been and continues to be committed to\npeace; we consider it a strategic option that requires the\nresumption of negotiations from the point at which they\nstopped on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and that\ncontinues to build on the commitments and undertakings\nreached until a just and comprehensive peace is established\nin the region.\nSyria stresses its concern for the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq and calls for alleviating the suffering of\nour brotherly Iraqi people and lifting the sanctions imposed\non them according to a specific timetable. In the meantime,\nIraq is called upon to implement the remaining Security\nCouncil resolutions in a way that guarantees a just\nresolution to the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war.\nSyria also calls for an end to the sanctions imposed on\nLibya, for it is our belief that it is possible to address this\ncrisis in an appropriate legal framework, separate from any\npolitical motivation. We fully support the Libyan demand\nfor a solution to this problem on a just basis.\nSyria stands against terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations; we condemn it on all fronts. We\ndifferentiate between terrorism and the legitimate struggle\nof peoples against foreign occupation and for self-\ndetermination and national liberation, which cannot be\nconsidered terrorism. We also condemn killing innocent\ncivilians everywhere, just as we condemn the State\nterrorism exercised by Israel against the Arabs.\nWe believe that resorting to force and violence in\ninternational relations, in contravention of the United\nNations Charter and the principles of international law,\ndoes not promote international legitimacy but leaves the\ndoor wide open to the law of the jungle. In this regard,\nSyria finds the United States attack on the Al-Shifa\npharmaceutical facility in Sudan to be unjustified. We\nbelieve that this attack constitutes a violation of the\nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. From this perspective, Syria supports the\nrequest of the Sudanese Government to the Security\nCouncil to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the\nAmerican allegations relating to that installation.\nSyria follows with great concern the sharp conflicts\nsweeping some African countries. While expressing its\nsolidarity and support to the peoples of Africa, Syria calls\non the international community to make the necessary\nefforts in close cooperation with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity to find solutions to these conflicts in a\nmanner that consolidates peace, stability and security on\nthe African continent. The international community is also\ncalled upon to give all types of support to enable African\nStates to eliminate the scourge of poverty and free\nthemselves of the burden of debt in order to achieve\nsustainable development.\nWe are also following with great concern the\nsituation in the Republic of Somalia. We urge all the\nSomali parties to respect their undertakings and\nimplement the agreements reached among them. We call\non them to put the national interests of Somalia above all\nother considerations and to cooperate with Arab, African\nand international efforts towards the realization of\nnational reconciliation so as to guarantee the return of\nsecurity and stability for the Somali people.\nSyria supports the measures taken to ensure the\nachievement of peace and security in the Korean\npeninsula, and we also support the Korean people?s\naspirations to achieve unity.\nSyria stresses anew the urgent need to take all\nnecessary steps, as promptly as possible, to end the\neconomic, commercial and financial sanctions imposed by\nthe United States against Cuba for more than three\ndecades now. We second Cuba?s call for the resolution of\ndifferences between the two countries through dialogue,\non the basis of equality, mutual respect and good-\nneighbourly relations.\n12\n\n\nSyria is extremely concerned about the general\nsituation in Afghanistan and the continuing bloodshed.\nSyria strongly condemns the killing of the Iranian diplomats\nin Mazar-i-Sharif. This was a violation of the principles of\ninternational law and of the tolerant values of Islam. We\ncall upon all parties to exercise self-restraint and to work\ntowards reaching a peaceful solution and national\nreconciliation.\nSyria supports the stand of the Non-Aligned\nMovement which considers the reform of the Security\nCouncil, its democratization and the expansion of its\nmembership as part and parcel of a package deal that is not\nsubject to a specific timetable. We emphasize the principles\nof equal sovereignty among States and equitable\ngeographical representation according to the provisions of\nthe Charter. Syria also believes that the exercise of the right\nof veto should be reduced and that its scope should be\nlimited.\nWe support the position of the Non-Aligned\nMovement concerning the concept of general agreement,\nspecifically that such agreement should, in conformity with\nthe provisions of Article 108 of the Charter, require a\nmajority of two thirds of Member States.\nThe Secretary-General?s proposed plan for reform was\na positive step to improve the Organization?s efficiency and\nenable it to cope with the changes required in the next\nstage. The Syrian delegation participated in the discussions\nrelevant to reforming the United Nations in the spirit of\ncollective responsibility of Member States to enhance the\nrole of this international Organization. We believe that\nMember States do have a major role to play in\nconsultations concerning the reforms and in the resulting\nresolutions.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights is an important occasion for re-\nemphasizing the fact that all human rights are universal and\ninterrelated and that the international community should\naddress human rights in a just and comprehensive manner,\nfree of double standards and manipulations for political\npurposes or to interfere in the internal affairs of States, and\ntaking into account the national characteristics and the\nhistorical, cultural and religious elements of each people\nand nation.\nHumankind continues to aspire to a world free of\nwars, poverty, ignorance and injustice, a world in which\njustice, security, stability and sustainable development\nprevail. Peoples of the world have pinned their hopes on\nthe United Nations Charter, which specifies among its\npurposes the importance of maintaining world peace and\nsecurity, developing relations among nations based on\nrespect for equality and self-determination of peoples,\nachieving international cooperation in the economic,\nsocial and cultural fields and enhancing basic freedoms\nfor mankind everywhere.\nLet us work together seriously and confidently on\nthe basis of these principles and objectives. Let us not\ndisappoint future generations. This is not an easy task, but\nit is certainly a noble one, which deserves our efforts,\nsacrifice, patience and wisdom.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to\nexpress to Mr. Didier Opertti the sincere congratulations of\nthe delegation of Equatorial Guinea on his unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI also wish to congratulate Ambassador Hennadiy\nUdovenko of Ukraine and to express my appreciation for\nthe enormous amount of work he accomplished as President\nat the last session.\nMay I also reiterate to the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, our brother Kofi Annan, my country\u2019s\nsupport for the efforts he is making to find viable solutions\nto conflicts in various parts of the world, and particularly\nin Africa. I would like to encourage him to continue with\nthe reforms he has undertaken to adapt and restructure the\nUnited Nations.\nOnce again, we are gathered here to consider and\nreflect on the great challenges humanity is confronting and\nwill have to continue to confront at the threshold of the\nnew millennium. Every year in this same forum we see that\nthe same causes produce the same effects, but solutions\nare slow to arrive. The fact is that we are all victims of\nour own contradictions.\nFrom this rostrum, we have been repeating for the\npast 50 years that humankind wants no more wars, that it\nwants a lasting peace. Nevertheless, the large industrial\ncomplexes continue to produce more weapons that are\nincreasingly sophisticated and deadly.\nWe are assured that the priority at the end of the\ncentury is the fight against poverty and the\nunderdevelopment of nations in the framework of the\nglobalization of our economies. Yet the problems of\nhunger, malnutrition, disease and unemployment are\nassuming alarming proportions, and in many cases the\ngrowth of these problems is even more apparent than in\nthe past. In the meantime, the peoples of the world\ncontinue to wait, and their future is filled with\nuncertainty.\nLet us be honest: disarmament is possible only if the\nlarge weapons-producing complexes are dismantled. To\nclaim the contrary is pure contradiction. Disarmament\nrequires the same approach as the fight against drugs \u2014\nin other words, the destruction of the centres of\nproduction, distribution and sale. There is no need for me\nto elaborate on this issue, since the solution is in the\nhands of those who benefit from this illicit trade.\nHowever, I do wish to refer to two questions that are\nthe subject of debate at this session of the General\nAssembly: the phenomenon of globalization and the fight\nagainst terrorism.\nIn connection with the former, we have serious\ndoubts and questions regarding the sincerity of this\ndialogue among nations. On the one hand, we have those\nwho offer many pretexts for continuing to obstruct free\ntrade, the free circulation of goods and persons and the\ntransfer of technology, and who erect other barriers that\nprevent the developing countries from achieving\nsustainable economic growth.\nAs for the African continent, we all know that the\nUruguay Round is an instrument for marginalizing the\ndeveloping countries, nor are we unaware that the\npayment of foreign debt remains a means of exporting\ncapital precisely to those who do not need it. Under these\ncircumstances, how can we devise an agenda for the\nglobalization of economic relations between the developed\n17\n\n\nNorth and the developing South, in a framework of\nfairness?\nGlobalization must begin with fair prices for our raw\nmaterials. The immense opportunities and advantages\noffered to the world markets by the developing countries of\nAfrica must be put to use in the context of a sincere\npartnership between North and South. No one has chosen\nmarginalization. The question is, should it be forced on us?\nSome detractors of the African continent apply\nsimplistic reasoning when they categorically state that the\nprinciple causes of poverty and marginalization in Africa\nare political in nature: poor governance, corruption and\narmed conflict.\nWithout trying to discard these arguments, we believe\nthat they do not justify the unfair treatment of our raw\nmaterials in the most profitable markets of the North. Nor\ndo we believe that the marginalization now suffered by the\nAfrican continent is an inevitable phenomenon. A great deal\nis being done to inscribe our countries in the current agenda\nof globalization. The ongoing processes of subregional and\nregional integration are evidence of the political will that\ntoday infuses African leaders.\nWe wonder about the degree of sincerity and\ntransparency in the dialogue aimed at facilitating the full\nintegration of the African economies into the mechanisms\nfor globalization of trade and into technological advances.\nAs for globalization, it should mean that everyone sells\nwhat he has and wherever he wishes, without the customs,\nadministrative and tariff barriers that today prevent the free\naccess of the products of the South to the markets of the\nNorth.\nFurthermore, the ever present issue of foreign debt\nremains an obstacle to economic growth in many\ndeveloping countries.\nMy country, Equatorial Guinea, sincerely believes that\nthis situation is not fortuitous, and far less is it due to a\nlack of potential or a lack of opportunity. What we call for\nis not simply assistance. We want our own efforts to be\nvalued; we want use to be made of the various\nopportunities we can offer to the world of globalization that\nlies ahead.\nNevertheless, all of this also requires the peace and\nsocio-political stability of nations. Unfortunately, it would\nseem that everything is being done to create instability in\nour countries. Today, we are seriously threatened from\noutside and within our borders by terrorism and\nmercenary actions carried out by individuals or groups\nblinded by hunger for power, ethnic hatred, racism and\nthe desire for hegemony.\nFor the first time in its history, my country has\nexperienced, in the course of the past 18 months, two acts\nof armed destabilization. One was on 17 May 1997, when\na ship carrying arms and mercenaries was detained by the\nAngolan police in its territorial waters. The other was on\n21 January of this year, when a group of individuals\nattacked a number of towns in my country and murdered\nsix persons in cold blood.\nWhat justification can there be for terrorist actions\nsuch as those perpetrated against the United States\nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania? What justification can\nthere be for a band of terrorists who murder peaceful\ncitizens in cold blood? What political claims can justify\nthe murder and mutilation of another human being, as\noccurred in my country?\nOn this question, some countries present here are\nacting with a double standard; depending on their own\ninterests, terrorist actions are justifiable or not. When\nthese actions take place within a developing country,\nsome powerful communications media invoke, among\nother such fallacies, the \u201cstruggle for the freedom of\npeoples\u201d to do away with regimes that, according to them,\nare dictatorial. But when similar actions of the same type\ntake place in any country of the North, then the story\nchanges, and those responsible for such actions are called\nterrorists and enemies of society.\nThat double standard was evident when such actions\nreceived the support and solidarity of certain Spanish\npolitical groups and elements of the Spanish\ncommunications media. Only the Government of that\ncountry condemned those acts. On the other hand, a lobby\nwas formed from among several political parties \u2014 the\nBasque Nationalist Party, the United Left and the Spanish\nSocialist Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 each of which published\ncommuniqu\u00e9s expressing their solidarity with the\nperpetrators of those terrorist acts. Since then, those same\ngroups have been trying to fabricate an ethnic problem in\nmy country. They have promoted a number of resolutions\nagainst my country in various international forums,\nincluding in recent meetings of the European Parliament\nand the Joint Assembly of the European Union and the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, in a clear\nattempt to justify the terrorist acts in question.\n18\n\n\nMy Government, however, faithful to its commitment\nto establish a State based on the rule of law in Equatorial\nGuinea, held a public trial, with procedural guarantees and\ninternational observers. Furthermore, the 15 death sentences\nimposed on the main perpetrators of those crimes have been\ncommuted by the President of the Republic of Equatorial\nGuinea, Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, in an effort to\npreserve the social unity of the nation. But it seems that\nsuch measures still do not satisfy the political circles that\nare persisting in their attempts to destabilize the peaceful\npeople of Equatorial Guinea.\nNevertheless, I would like to assure the Assembly that,\nthanks to the maturity of the people of Equatorial Guinea\nand because of their peaceful spirit and openness to\ndialogue and democratic debate, we have been free from\nthe serious upheavals experienced by some countries and\nregions of our continent as a result of such actions.\nThe internal realities of Equatorial Guinea therefore\nbear no relation to the systematic campaign of hounding\nand harassment that has been waged against it for several\nyears. Peace and stability prevail, investments are flowing\nin and there are real signs of growth. The political reforms\nare irreversible, our State of law is being strengthened and\nthe better governance of the country is being promoted. To\nthat end, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has relations\nof cooperation with several international organizations and\nfriendly countries for the establishment of technical\nassistance programmes in the fields of economics,\ndemocracy, human rights and governance. We are\ncontinuing to cooperate with the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights, and our cooperation with\nthe international financial institutions is positive in the areas\nto which I have referred.\nWe are clearly living during a time of promise and\nrebirth in our country. We appeal here to the international\ncommunity to show its solidarity by supporting our efforts\nto consolidate the democratic process and the\nimplementation of the plan for the socio-economic\ndevelopment of the country, outlined by the national\neconomic conference, which took place in Bata from 8 to\n14 September 1997.\nWith regard to the African continent, we urge the\ninternational community to find mechanisms geared to\nachieving a ceasefire and ending the hostilities in the Great\nLakes region and to restoring peace and order in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Guinea-Bissau,\nSierra Leone, Eritrea and Ethiopia. To that end, we wish to\nreaffirm here the recommendations contained in the Bata\ndeclaration for the promotion of democracy, peace and\nsustainable development in Africa, which was adopted by\nthe subregional conference on democratic institutions and\npeace in Central Africa, held from 18 to 21 May 1998\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, at which the\nPresident of Equatorial Guinea recommended the creation\nof a subregional parliament to deal with issues so as to\nguarantee peace and security in the subregion. Equatorial\nGuinea pledges to make its contribution to the attainment\nof that objective.\nFinally, my country reaffirms its support for the\nnecessary reform of the Security Council. With regard to\nthe increase of its membership, we are in favour of\nequitable distribution so that our Organization will be able\nfaithfully to reflect the geopolitical realities of today\u2019s\nworld. In this context, Equatorial Guinea associates itself\nwith the position, adopted at the twelfth summit of the\nnon-aligned countries held a month ago in Durban, South\nAfrica, that Africa should have two permanent seats and\nfive non-permanent seats, in the interests of the credibility\nand democratization of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The election of the Foreign Minister of\nUruguay as President of this session of the General\nAssembly is a source of great pride to Latin America. It is\nalso a fitting tribute to Mr. Opertti, whose diplomatic\nexperience and skills augur well for the success of this\nfifty-third session.\nJust when it seemed that we had secured stability,\nsigns of a severe crisis reappeared in the horizon. Indeed,\ncommodity prices have declined on average by 30 per cent,\nreaching their lowest levels in the last three decades in real\nterms. Consequently, exports from Latin America to\ndeveloped countries, consisting primarily of raw materials,\nhave begun to shrink, and trade balance deficits in the\nregion have increased proportionately.\nThere has been a decline in growth of output in Latin\nAmerica. Businesses are reducing production volume,\npaying less tax and going further into debt with the banks.\nThere is a proportionate decline in domestic savings and\ninvestment in infrastructure, in the training of human\nresources and in the production of goods and services.\nVisible unemployment is on the rise, and shadow economic\nactivities are gaining ground.\nThis brief account \u2014 no less grim for its brevity \u2014\nof the current situation points to a dangerous recession in\nAsia and Latin America.\nOf course, the fact that this turbulence began about a\nyear ago in Asia, halfway round the world, before reaching\nthe Andes, reveals the extent to which the world economic\nsystem has become interdependent. Both the scale and the\nconsequences of this interdependence would have been\ninconceivable until recently. The planet has indeed become\nthe global village which was to be the sign of the future, as\nwe had all heard.\nBut there is an ugly and unfair side to globalization\nthat I wish to stress. Countries \u2014 and when I use the\nword, I do not just mean abstract entities, but actual\npeople with spiritual and material needs \u2014 are not paying\nonly for their own mistakes but also for the economic\npolicy errors and negligence of others.\nLet me take my own country as an example. A small\ncountry, with enormous structural limitations, it made a\ngigantic effort, at enormous cost and at the price of\nenormous sacrifices, to put its accounts and institutional\nstructure in order. Bolivia overcame hyper-inflation,\nrestored its macroeconomic balance and made progress in\nfirst- and second-generation structural reforms. We\nestablished a democratic system which, while not perfect,\nis being studied in our region as a model of political\ncooperation and social dialogue. We are prepared to\ncommit all our energies to casting off the historic chains\nof corruption and poverty.\nThis entire effort, just now beginning to be\nproductive, may be thwarted by causes that are beyond\nour control and for which we bear no responsibility. It is\ntrue that our progress may not have been sufficiently\nrapid and that our economic and social structures are still\nweak, but the crisis we face today does not stem from\nthese deficiencies.\nBolivia and other countries will have to foot the bill\nfor the mistakes of others, for far distant trivialities. We\nare suffering, the analysts tell us, from the contagion of\nthe Asian crisis, and we would do well to pray harder to\nprevent anything happening in our own country or\nanywhere in the broad region surrounding us.\nMy country did what it had to do and did it well. No\none wants to go back to the past. No right-thinking\nBolivian wants for a moment to return to the days of\nauthoritarianism, hyper-inflation or the bureaucratic state.\nNo, this is not what it is all about. But nor is it about\nacting as if nothing had happened \u2014 as if all that was\nnecessary to overcome this crisis was to take a stronger\ndose of the same medicine. That would be an\nunforgivable mistake.\nThe current situation has revealed such shortcomings\nin the international system, particularly with regard to\ninternational financial flows, that it would not make sense\nto keep things as they are. Next month there will be a\nmeeting of the Ministers of Finance of the Group of\nSeven \u2014 the nexus of world economic power \u2014 to\ndecide our fate. I do not know if our voice will be heard,\n16\n\n\nbut I do believe that this Assembly of the peoples of the\nworld is itself a message that can at least remind them of\na few things.\nThere is a need for prompt and concerted action on\nthe part of the advanced and developing countries to\ndiminish the volatility of financial markets and to provide\nsome discipline and procedures for incentives and penalties\naimed at remedying the major shortcomings in these\nmarkets. There must be an increase in the availability of\npublic financial resources in the International Monetary\nFund and other institutions to compensate promptly and\nefficiently for damage caused by unduly heightened risk in\nany given country or by the wanton recklessness of\nspeculators on the world\u2019s stock markets.\nThere must be a discussion very soon about the nature\nand the new role of the International Monetary Fund and\nthe World Bank and of the necessary adjustments thereto,\nbecause these bodies were created in a context quite\ndifferent from that of today and clearly have been\noverwhelmed by the events of recent years, which could not\nbe prevented. Their structure, their resources, their\nphilosophy and their modus operandi were severely\ncriticized since the 1980s in Latin America and in the\nAssembly, and today they have shown themselves to be\nunable to contain the impact of the current crisis. We have\nglobalized the crises of poverty and unemployment. Let us\nalso globalize the commitment to solve them.\nBy virtue of the universal nature of this body, by\nvirtue of the terms of the Charter of San Francisco and\nbecause it is here that the concerns and problems of the\nStates Members of this supreme world Organization should\nbe set forth, I must once again raise what is well known as\nBolivia\u2019s maritime problem.\nAlmost 120 years ago, in a military confrontation not\nof its own making, Bolivia lost a long strip of coastline on\nthe Pacific Ocean. Our country thus lost, temporarily, its\nmaritime status, its sovereign access to the sea \u2014 an\nessential condition of its existence \u2014 as well as its\ngeopolitical role and status as a bridge between the great\nbasins of South America.\nThe economic damage wrought by this loss was\nimmense. I will not take time here today to mention the\nvalue of the minerals and fishing resources of this territory,\nas it is incalculable. Suffice it to recall that recent studies\nhave shown that the cost of the landlocked condition of my\ncountry is estimated at $4 billion every 10 years, an amount\nequal to that of our foreign debt.\nHowever, perhaps the most serious consequence of\nthis ill-fated event was that my country was condemned\nto be penned in behind the Andes, far removed from the\nmainstream of the passage of goods, peoples and cultures,\nwhich are the very lifelines of the development of\nnations. Therefore, ever mindful of the magnitude of the\ndamage, my country never accepted this status of\nisolation imposed upon us. We have unceasingly called\nfor this injustice to be redressed, but in doing so we have\nabided by our tradition as peaceful people that rejects\nconflicts. However, our voices never fell silent.\nWe sought bilateral negotiations with Chile and\nbrought our case to international forums.\nOn various occasions, the bilateral negotiations\nconcluded with agreements or concrete proposals for a\nsolution whose main objective was the return to Bolivia\nof its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, with a\ncoastline, a port of its own and an overland link. For\nreasons that I shall not go into now, these dealings were\nnever concluded and were added to the long list of lost\nopportunities on the record of relations between our\ncountries.\nBolivia\u2019s cause has always been met with the\nsympathy and understanding of the international\ncommunity. There have been numerous expressions of\nsuch solidarity. I would just like to refer to two, one in\nthe framework of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\nother in that of the Organization of American States\n(OAS). I will state only the relevant portion of the\nresolution adopted by the ninth General Assembly of the\nOrganization of American States, which was held in La\nPaz in 1979. That resolution states, in its operative part\nthat,\n\u201cit is in the inherent interest of our hemisphere to\nfind an equitable solution whereby Bolivia can\nobtain sovereign and effective access to the Pacific\nOcean\u201d\nas part of a proposal aimed at,\n\u201csecuring, in a spirit of fraternity and integration of\nthe Americas, the objective referred to in the\nprevious paragraph and to consolidate a stable peace\nwhich would stimulate economic and social progress\nin the region of the Americas directly affected by\nthe consequences of Bolivia\u2019s landlocked condition.\u201d\n17\n\n\nIn spite of everything, the problem still awaits a\nsolution. It is a kind of throwback to another time, another\nlogic, another way of seeing relations between neighbouring\nnations. This has left an indelible mark on the memory of\nmy country. I must therefore state emphatically before the\nAssembly that Bolivia will never back down from its\ndemand and that it will not be discouraged by how long its\nefforts may take. Bolivia has the staying power and\nlimitless patience of an ancient people and knows that the\ntime is sure to come when this long-standing issue will be\ndefinitively resolved. Our hope becomes conviction when\nwe see how other nations find ways of unravelling the\nGordian knot of conflicts at least as complex as our own.\nThe case made by President Hugo Banzer last year in\nthe Assembly is still valid. He recently put it again to the\ntwelfth presidential summit of the Rio Group in the\nfollowing terms:\n\u201cThere is no subject which cannot be discussed, if it\nis approached in good faith, without preconceptions or\nprejudices. The subjects of peace, security and\ndemocracy are not items reserved for diplomats and\nspecialists. All the institutions of society have an\nopinion to voice and ideas to contribute. These are\nvoices which must be heard and heeded. I would\ntherefore like to propose that wherever there is open\nconflict between our nations or where the embers of\nancient conflicts still smoulder, let us call upon our\ncitizens to help us find the path to solutions. Let us\nthrow open the windows of Latin American diplomacy\nand let in the fresh air of new opinions and the sound\nof new voices. Only recently I made the same point\nby suggesting that Bolivians and Chileans meet\ntogether and talk about the vast potential of our\nrelationship and find a way of removing the obstacles\nwhich block its path. I am repeating this here today,\nbecause I am convinced that we must find a way of\nbreaking with the status quo. We cannot bind\nourselves to the inheritance of other times and other\nproblems.\u201d\nIt could not be clearer that now is the time for\neconomic integration and a political solution for access to\nthe ocean, not for confrontations. The nature of the global\nsystem requires the formation of large-scale spaces in\nwhich ideas and goods can move freely, where common\ninstitutions can be built and where new cultures can be\nnurtured, the fruit of the mingling of diverse peoples. If this\nis true anywhere, it is true in Latin America.\nIn order to clear the path along these major\nhighways, we must remove the obstacles that are blocking\nor hindering the march towards integration. In the case of\nrelations between Bolivia and Chile, this means resolving\nthe age-old disputes which led to the breaking off of\ndiplomatic relations at the end of the 1970s. The\nliberalization of trade, agreements on economic\ncomplementarity and arrangements for free transit are all\nessential parts of this picture, but not the whole picture.\nFor this to happen, what is needed is vision and\ncourage on both sides. If we want to find new, different\nsolutions in keeping with the times, we can no longer\nremain mired in the juridical, diplomatic and military\nlogic of the past. If we want to find answers, we may\nhave to move outside those circles that have traditionally\nhandled these matters up to now. This is the sense of the\nproposal of President Banzer: to bring businessmen,\nworkers, churches, professionals and the peoples of\nBolivia and Chile into the dialogue.\nOf course, the international community has a crucial\nrole to play in the search for agreement. The counsel,\nguidance and help of friendly countries within the\nframework of the subregional integration processes in\nwhich they are engaged may just be the missing factor\nneeded to get dialogue going, to bring diplomats to the\nnegotiating table, to make leaders shoulder their historical\nresponsibilities and to reach a solution bringing our\npeoples together. My country is convinced that the\nunderlying problems must be dealt with because we know\nthat integration will be consolidated only when economic\nagreements guarantee that it will be sustained by the\npolitical will and confidence of our nations.\nThere are many initiatives that should not be left\nonly on paper. Last June, during the special session\ndevoted to the drug problem, important proposals were\nmade. Bolivia put forth the idea of creating a body,\nsimilar to a consultative group, made up of countries that\nwould help finance the high cost of the fight against drug-\ntrafficking. We would like to know what steps have been\ntaken to implement this, as well as the other initiatives\nthat were proposed in that highly important specialized\nforum.\nThe phenomenon of corruption, which is no stranger\nto most countries represented here, is a disease that\nspreads and damages our institutional structures, saps the\nlegitimacy of democracy, distorts the economy, creates\nbad habits in public administration and erodes morality.\n18\n\n\nIn compliance with a presidential order, last 21\nSeptember we had the honour of celebrating at a solemn\nceremony the signing of an accord among the principal\ninstitutions of the State representing the three branches of\npower, whereby the National Integrity Plan came into\neffect. This Plan establishes a comprehensive strategy to\ncombat corruption. The judicial basis for the Plan is taken\nfrom the Inter-American Convention against Corruption,\nwhich was signed by the member States of the OAS in\n1996 and which Bolivia was the first nation to ratify as the\nlaw of the land.\nAfter careful thought, we have made this policy one\nof the highest priorities of the Government of Bolivia. We\nhave begun to put into effect the first concrete measures to\ncombat this evil and to make this proposal State policy. We\nnow invite the international community to follow our\nendeavour closely and to support our initiative.\nBolivia vigorously adheres to all the statements that\nhave repudiated terrorism, a despicable practice that has no\njustification whatsoever. It will support any initiative or\naction that may be put forth to fight it.\nIn another area, we wish to underline the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s task in the process of the reform of the United\nNations. We believe that there has been progress in the\nefforts to reduce bureaucracy, rationalize expenses and\navoid duplication in the work of the United Nations. We\nalso believe that it would be healthy to enhance the\nEconomic and Social Council in order to turn it into an\neconomic, social, scientific and technological council. It\nwould also be worthwhile to create a council for\nhumanitarian affairs responsible for social problems of our\ntime, such as poverty, unemployment, discrimination and all\nforms of exclusion.\nWe meet every year to express our concerns and\nthoughts, to share experiences and reaffirm our faith in the\npurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter. Each\nyear, we would like to see positive advances in the solution\nof problems, in joint responses to crises, in the spread of\npeace on the world map. Thus, the United Nations will\ncontinue to grow even stronger. Bolivia wishes, as always,\nto contribute to the achievement of those goals.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure,\nSir, to extend to you my congratulations and those of the\nIndonesian delegation on your election to the presidency\nof the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I\nshould like to assure you of our full cooperation in the\ndischarge of your duties.\nTo your distinguished predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, I wish to convey our\nfelicitations for having so ably guided the fifty-second\nsession to a successful conclusion.\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor his dedication to the reform and restructuring of the\nOrganization, as well as for his determined efforts to seek\na peaceful solution to conflict situations in various parts\nof the world.\nOne of the great ironies of our time is that at the end\nof a century in which the amazing advances of science\nand technology could have been harnessed to effectively\naddress the problem of poverty, scores of millions more\npeople have slipped below the poverty line. At the same\ntime, there has been a massive application of science and\ntechnology to increase humankind\u00e2s capacity to deal out\ndeath and destruction. Even in the best of times,\nhumankind\u00e2s use of economic resources has not been\nmarked by any deep sense of responsibility but rather by\n22\n\n\nmindless consumption that has often led to the degradation\nof our environment. Unfortunately squandering resources is\nan old habit of the human race.\n\nToday, I fear that the awesome force of globalization,\nitself propelled by science and technology, is also being\nsquandered: instead of serving to unify humankind in a\ndecisive assault against the persistent systemic problems of\nour time, it is being used to press the advantage of the\nstrong over the weak, thereby widening the gap between the\ndeveloped and developing world.\nHerein lies the tragedy of the human race: that our\nvast capacity to alter the planet on which we live has been\nmatched to a parochial vision. Large and complex actions\nare motivated by narrow self-interest. And in the\nnarrowness of our perspective we inflict great harm on one\nanother. That is why the imbalances and inequities in\ninternational relations persist: we can never get rid of them\nuntil we attain that essential balance within ourselves,\nbetween the scope of our actions and that of our intentions.\nYet I do not despair. Against the backdrop of a\ncentury of conflict, one human achievement shines: the\nfounding of the United Nations. It is admittedly a flawed\nachievement, for after five decades it has not yet brought us\nthe global peace that we envisaged to be its greatest\npromise. But it has spared us from the horrors of another\nworld war and possibly from a nuclear holocaust. That this\nflawed jewel of human reason should remain to serve us in\na more effective way in the next century is an imperative.\nThrough its instrumentality, it is still possible for us to tame\nthe dogs of war and to exorcise the spectre of poverty.\nThrough its processes of consultation and debate, we can\nstill attain a broadness of mind that matches the global\nsweep of our actions. Through the habits of cooperation and\ntrust that it engenders among its Members and among the\ncountless individuals and institutions that participate in its\ndialogues, we might yet realize our shared vision of a\nglobal civil society. But first it must be reformed, further\ndemocratized and fully empowered.\nThe United Nations, as the central mechanism and\ncatalyst for multilateral cooperation, must be enabled to\nplay its mandated role in the achievement and maintenance\nof peace, security and development. It is therefore of the\ngreatest importance that it be provided with the resources\nwith which to carry on its work instead of being strapped\nfor funds as it is now. The legal obligation of every\nMember State in that regard must therefore be strictly met.\nIt is also essential that the ongoing process of reform\nof the United Nations be intensified, particularly with\nregard to the Security Council, taking into account the\ndesire of all States from all regions to participate in its\nwork, as well as present political, economic and\ndemographic realities. For indeed, developing countries\nare grossly under-represented on the Council especially at\na time when its work is focused on conflict situations in\nthe developing world. This anomaly has to be redressed\nby an increase in the representation of the developing\nworld in the permanent as well as in the non-permanent\nmembership of the Council. The legitimacy, credibility\nand effectiveness of the Council\u00e2s work depend on its\nrepresentative character. Indonesia views the task of\nSecurity Council reform as a matter of urgency, but we\nmust not be rushed into any hasty or ill-advised decisions\nthat would be detrimental to the long-term interests of\nMember States. In this context, there is a need to continue\nand accelerate the work of the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council.\nIf the cause of disarmament, particularly nuclear\ndisarmament, has not made substantive progress in recent\nyears, it is largely because there are States that believe\nthey have much to gain by their exclusive possession of\nnuclear arms. The unjustifiable privileges conferred on the\nnuclear-weapon States have given rise to a regime of\ndiscrimination and hypocrisy as well as a situation where\nnon-nuclear countries wishing to enjoy the same\nprivileges seek to become nuclear States themselves.\nThus, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) has not fully met its objectives, and the\nimbalances and discrimination inherent to it have\npersisted. Regrettably, too, the second Preparatory\nCommittee for the 2000 Review Conference failed to\nagree on substantive issues. Still, we must persevere and\nprepare ourselves for the next NPT Review Conference\nand focus on the inequities and imbalances inherent in the\nTreaty. At the same time, we urge the nuclear-weapon\nStates to implement faithfully both the letter and spirit of\nagreements relating to non-proliferation and nuclear\ndisarmament. We call on all States to refrain from\ndeveloping these weapons so that we may the sooner\nattain our ultimate objective of their total elimination.\nThe slow pace of progress towards non-proliferation\nand nuclear disarmament compels us to work even harder\nto achieve global disarmament objectives. The convening\nof the fourth special session of the General Assembly\ndevoted to disarmament is essential for providing new\n23\n\n\npolitical momentum that would enable and encourage the\nGovernments and peoples of the world to move towards\ndisarmament, including the elimination of nuclear weapons.\nIt is therefore imperative that we take further concrete steps\nleading to the convening of the fourth special session.\nWhile disarmament marks time, discord is rampant in\nthe form of armed conflicts, disputes and tensions between\nand within States in many parts of the globe. The situation\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a source of continuing\nconcern for Indonesia. Hence, we reaffirm our steadfast\nsupport for the full, impartial and effective implementation\nof the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Afghanistan, we call on\nthe warring factions to cease hostilities and to start\nconstructive dialogue. The protracted civil strife in that\ncountry also threatens to spill over beyond its borders. We\nurge the parties concerned to cooperate with the United\nNations in its concerted endeavours to restore peace and\nstability in the region. The dire situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo calls for continued and concerted\nefforts in restoring peace and tranquillity.\nIndonesia is appalled by the terrorist bomb attacks on\nthe American embassies in the capitals of Kenya and\nTanzania that caused the death of nearly 200 people and the\nwounding of thousands. We reiterate our condemnation of\nall acts and forms of terrorism wherever they may occur\nand whoever perpetrates them. At the same time, we stress\nthat we will never condone the resort to unilateral acts of\naggression and violation of the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of States as a means to combat terrorism. We\ntherefore urge all States to enhance international\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism while strictly\nobserving and implementing the relevant international\ninstruments.\nMy delegation welcomes the recent positive\ndevelopments concerning the Lockerbie incident that\nculminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution\n1192 (1998). It is our hope that discussions will now take\nplace between the United Kingdom, the United States and\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including on the appropriate\ntrial arrangements. Early implementation of this resolution\nwill hopefully lead to a definitive settlement of this issue\nand the lifting of sanctions imposed on Libya.\nIn the Middle East, the situation in the occupied\nterritories keeps deteriorating as the peace process remains\nin the grip of a stalemate. Israeli policies and practices of\noppression and provocation have continued unabated. In a\nblatant attempt to change the demography of the occupied\nterritories, Israel keeps building new settlements and\nexpanding existing ones. More ominously, it has\narbitrarily extended the administrative powers of the\noccupying authorities in Jerusalem beyond the city\u00e2s\nborders in a bid to consolidate Israel\u00e2s hold on East\nJerusalem and the West Bank and thereby entrench\nJerusalem as its capital. This would pre-empt negotiations\non the status of the Holy City and threaten to unravel the\npeace process, with grave repercussions not only for the\nMiddle East but also beyond.\nPeace and stability will continue to elude the region\nuntil Israel complies with its treaty obligations and\nunconditionally withdraws from all occupied Arab\nterritories in accordance with all relevant United Nations\nresolutions, in particular 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978). The peace process must be resumed and\nagreements reached must be implemented in their entirety\nand not selectively or conditionally.\nIn South-East Asia, the elections held recently in\nCambodia, deemed to have been generally free and fair\nby international observers, should now lead to the\nrestoration of normalcy in the country. It is time that all\nthe parties in Cambodia resolve their differences in the\nspirit of national reconciliation and unity in the larger\ninterest of their country, work together toward the\nformation of a new government and thereby contribute to\npeace and stability in South-East Asia.\nThe world economy is teetering on the brink of\nrecession, if not already experiencing one. Economic\noutput has slowed for the developed and developing\ncountries alike, and growth in world trade has also\ndecelerated. While official forecasts indicate a slowdown\nin the growth of world output to 2.5 per cent, any such\nforecasts may still be too optimistic. Only a little more\nthan a year ago, the world economy was on a significant\ngrowth path, and the outlook was generally bright. In\nAsia, robust growth for decades had transformed much of\nthe region into an economic powerhouse. Today, many of\nthose dynamic economies are crippled. One third of the\nworld is grappling with serious economic slowdown and\nthe frightening possibility of a depression.\nIn the affected countries, including Indonesia,\neconomic turmoil has reached a devastating level, pushing\ntheir economies into recession and their people to the\nvery edge of their endurance. Unemployment has soared,\nand an unacceptable number of people have slipped under\nthe poverty line. Education has been severely affected,\nand food is in short supply. The experience of South-East\nAsian countries in this financial turmoil has shown that\n24\n\n\neven the most dynamic economies are vulnerable. In spite\nof the judicious macroeconomic policies that they adopted\nand the often painful structural adjustments that they carried\nout, the development gains they earned over the decades\ncrumbled in the span of a few weeks. The lesson of this\ndebacle is that the market is driven by sentiments as much\nas fundamentals, by perception rather than facts alone.\nThese adverse aspects of globalization have\nfurthermore greatly eroded multilateral cooperation for\ndevelopment. The concept of development as a special part\nof a multilateral support system has been largely replaced\nby the laissez-faire approach to the globalized economy.\nThis has resulted, inter alia, in sharply contracted financial\nresources for development for the majority of the\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\ncountries. External indebtedness has escalated, and\nprotectionism in international trade has risen significantly\nas more and more countries have become inward-looking in\nthis era of globalization.\nThis dire situation will certainly impact on the\nimplementation of the commitments agreed upon at the\nrecent major global conferences, including in the fields of\nenvironment and development, social development,\npopulation and development, women and development,\nhabitat and food. It is therefore a matter of great concern to\nall of us that the achievement of sustainable human\ndevelopment will be further removed from reality.\nI believe that our troubles are less the result of the\nvagaries of globalization than the consequence of an\neconomic doctrine that has dominated international\neconomic relations for many years now. This doctrine\npresents unbridled liberalization as a panacea for all\neconomies, developed and developing. In their desire to\nintegrate themselves with the global economy, many\ndeveloping countries have audaciously opened up their\neconomies, only to realize that the social and political costs\nof doing so often outstrip the benefits. Moreover, the\ninordinate emphasis on unfettered markets has led to the\nneglect of such development issues as international\ncooperation for development, the need for non-commercial\nfinancial flows and the necessity of differential treatment\nfor developing countries. Thus, the international agenda has\nbeen governed by the interests of the developed countries\nin opening up opportunities for foreign investments, private\ncapital flows \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that often turn out to be merely\nspeculative \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the export of their manufactures.\nIn the face of such stark global realities, we must\nintensify international solidarity and cooperation. The\ninternational community should strengthen its\nmanagement role in the world economy, in particular in\nthe monetary and financial fields, including the\nestablishment of surveillance and regulatory frameworks\nfor short-term capital flows and trade in currencies,\nwithout constraining the liberalization of economies. This\nstrengthened international management role is essential if\nwe seek to avert future crises, alleviate the adverse impact\nof globalization and maximize its benefits.\nWe should therefore seriously consider various\ninitiatives for enhancing global financial and monetary\ncooperation. The proposed United Nations conference on\nfinancing for development would provide an opportunity\nto explore various options towards financial stability and\ndevelopment. It is also encouraging that the two-day high-\nlevel dialogue of the General Assembly last week\ncontributed to increased awareness and understanding of\nthe economic and social impact of globalization and the\nneed for international cooperation in addressing that issue.\nAnother important proposal is the one made by the\nNon-Aligned Movement for an international conference\non money and finance for development in order to pursue\ncomprehensive reform of the existing international\nmonetary and financial system.\nBecause we want the North-South dialogue to\nproceed in earnest, we should broaden and intensify\nSouth-South cooperation. Decades of development efforts\nhave greatly increased the economic complementarities\namong developing countries. We must tap these\ncomplementarities and strengthen partnership in the South.\nIn this effort, our developed-country partners and\ninternational institutions can play a valuable role by\nparticipating in tripartite arrangements. In this regard, a\nnumber of steps to promote South-South cooperation have\nbeen initiated, including a high-level meeting on regional\nand subregional cooperation, which will be held in Bali,\nIndonesia, this coming December. The commemoration of\nthe twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos\nAires Plan of Action on South-South cooperation will be\nheld at a special one-day meeting in the General\nAssembly. Of great importance is the Group of 77\ninitiative on a South summit to be held prior to the\nMillennium Assembly, in the year 2000.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which was\nproclaimed as a common standard of achievement for all\npeoples and all nations. To us in Indonesia who are now\nin the midst of formulating and initiating far-reaching\n25\n\n\neconomic, social and political reforms, this is a particularly\nsignificant occasion. In fact, in line with our commitment\nto the Vienna Declaration, we have just launched a National\nPlan of Action on Human Rights aimed at infusing the\nvarious segments of society and of the Government,\nincluding the national security apparatus, with values\nconducive to the promotion and protection of human rights.\nWe expect to sign and ratify in the near future several more\nUnited Nations conventions on human rights.\nThe reform-development Government that is now in\nplace in Indonesia will carry out vigorous measures to\nfurther democratize our national life. For we know very\nwell that our economic recovery will basically have to be\ndriven by confidence, on the part of the international\ncommunity as well as on the part of our own citizens, in\nour own system of governance.\nIn the face of the challenges of our time, we in\nIndonesia will rebuild and refine the institutions that will\nmake the laws of economics work for our society. At the\ninternational level, I believe that it is also necessary to\nbuild and refine the institutions that will make global\neconomics work for all nations, whether developed or\ndeveloping.\nGlobalization is not the demon that has been menacing\nour prospects for the future. But for too long we have\naccepted doctrines formulated and waved in the name of\nliberalization. The most perceptive economists of our day\nhave been pointing out that error, and we must now heed\nthem. Globalization and liberalization never required us to\nmerely compete in dancing to the tune of the market place.\nIt never told us to stop cooperating with one another. But\nmany of us were enchanted with the gospel of unfettered\nlaissez-faire until it was seen that the contagion of a\nfinancial crisis in one developing country in one corner of\nthe globe could plunge the entire world into depression.\nNow it is clear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if it was not sufficiently clear\nbefore \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that we are stewards of one another\u00e2s welfare,\nthat we must extend a hand to every brother and sister who\nfalters, or in the course of globalization none of us,\ndeveloped or developing, will see salvation. Human destiny\nis indivisible. Let us never forget that again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nbring to you, Sir, and to all the representatives to this\nGeneral Assembly the warm greetings of the people of\nDjibouti. I extend to Mr. Opertti my sincere\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. As the world\ngrows smaller and the problems confronting us grow ever\nmore challenging, the deliberations of humanity?s forum,\nthe General Assembly, assume a critical urgency. His\ncompetence and broad experience will undoubtedly guide\nus very ably in the coming year.\nWe are also most grateful to his predecessor, the\nformer Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for bringing to bear\na degree of focus and productivity that was exemplary.\nThrough his exceptional grasp of the issues before the\nGeneral Assembly, he was able to lead us to satisfactory\nresults.\nOur indefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, continues to earn our deepest appreciation for the\nmanner in which he has managed the activities of the\n\n\nOrganization, especially for the way in which the United\nNations has risen in the eyes of the general public.\nDemands on the United Nations have increased. Ever-\nchanging economic, environmental, social and political\nproblems have added to these demands. Core contributions\nto the funds and programmes continue to decline, however,\nand the United Nations faces unpredictable resource flows\ndue to unpaid assessments. Recognizing that a radical\ntransformation of the United Nations would cause political\ntensions, the Secretary-General wisely formulated a series\nof realistic reforms to rationalize operations, reduce costs\nand refocus on certain critical areas demanding United\nNations attention, such as the mitigation of poverty,\nsustainable development and strengthening management and\ncoordination, both at Headquarters and in field-level\nactivities.\nWe support the Secretary-General?s relentless efforts\nto communicate directly with and engage the people of the\nworld, exploring critical issues and exchanging views with\nthem, and explaining the role, capacities and constraints of\nthe United Nations system. His work has given the United\nNations a reality and a new face vital to its mission.\nIn early August, a corner of our world, eastern Africa,\nwas profoundly shocked, baffled and aggrieved by the well-\ncoordinated simultaneous bombings of United States\nembassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Over 260 people\nlost their lives and thousands of innocent people were\ninjured in those attacks.\nThese brazen acts of aggression wrought\nunprecedented carnage and extensive destruction and\ndamage to property. I recently visited Nairobi. What I saw\nresembled a war zone. I unreservedly condemn this\nsenseless act of terrorism. Once again, I wish to express our\nheartfelt condolences to all the families who lost their loved\nones in this tragedy and pray for the speedy recovery of the\ninjured.\nMay I also express our concern at the United States\naction against the Sudan. There are growing doubts about\nthe justification for the raid that devastated the El Shifa\npharmaceutical plant, which produced desperately needed\nmedicines and drugs. Visiting there recently, I was struck\nby the extent of the damage. All that is left of the plant is\na mountain of rubble. The onus lies now on the United\nStates to produce fuller evidence to support its claim. We\nalso urge the United Nations to undertake an independent\ninvestigation to determine whether this factory was indeed\nmaking chemical weapons, as alleged.\nIt seems essential to remind ourselves that the annual\nsession of the General Assembly has become the sole\noccasion for virtually all mankind, collectively, to\nappraise the human condition. Additionally, drawn as we\nare by the hypnotic spell of the approaching millennium,\nthe need to assess our past successes, achievements and\nfailures and to develop priorities and strategies for the\nfuture has assumed a sense of urgency.\nA little over 50 years ago, the world embarked with\ngreat vision, enthusiasm and optimism upon a high-\nminded journey to end the scourge of war, eliminate\npoverty and create a world of freedom and justice for all.\nUndoubtedly, much has been accomplished and the world\nis a far better place to live in, despite the fact that many\ndreams remain unfulfilled and many commitments\nunimplemented.\nThis decade, in particular, has witnessed tendencies\ntowards the fragmentation of societies, the spread of civil\nstrife and conflict and a plunge further into the poverty\ntrap. In general, we recognize that respect for human\nrights has improved and that many countries have\nembraced democracy and good governance, and we\nwelcome that.\nUnfortunately, human rights violations continue, and\nthere is a lingering concern about the capacity, resources\nand mandates of the United Nations for timely\nintervention in cases of egregious violations of human\nrights. We have had the bad experience of regrettable\nvacillation and indifference in the face of appalling crimes\ncommitted in Bosnia and Rwanda, and now in Kosovo.\nAs the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights has correctly stated, efforts to prevent the most\nabominable violence should focus not only on resolving\nethnic and political disputes, but also on the social issues\nof chronic underdevelopment, grinding poverty, mass\nunemployment, widespread illiteracy and systematic\ninequalities of income or opportunities.\nWe therefore welcome the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which replaces once and for\nall the ad hoc proceedings. It fills in the gap in\ninternational law exposed by the famous Nuremberg trials\nof Nazi war criminals: the need to install a permanent\ninternational institution able to investigate war crimes,\ngenocide and crimes against humanity.\nMuch of the technological advancement of the\ntwentieth century has created a host of other problems.\nMan?s mastery over nature for his own benefit has\n2\n\n\nbecome a potential nightmare of environmental disasters,\none which we seemingly lack the will to contain or correct.\nWill we continue to have land to farm, clean water to drink\nand healthy air to breath? Will our cities decay into piles of\nhumans for whom day to day survival becomes the\ncrowning achievement of their lives?\nOverpopulation, abject poverty, crime, drugs and the\nconsequences they bring may soon threaten the foundations\nof social cohesion. To a great extent, these forces are\ntransnational, extending beyond the capacity and control of\nindividual States. They are global in nature and pose\nserious challenges to society and its leadership. We must\nact collectively in marshalling the resources necessary to\nmitigate the harmful effects of modernization and\nglobalization.\nUnquestionably, the founding of the United Nations\nwas one of the outstanding achievements of this century.\nAfter 50 years, we can take pride in the continuing\nrelevance of this institution. Naturally, given the breadth\nand complexity of issues facing the United Nations and\nmankind, there will always be differences of views on the\nevolving role of the United Nations. However, the basic\nmission of the United Nations has not changed one iota:\ncollective international action for maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and promotion of economic\nand social development for all.\nWhile the Charter remains relevant, the world of 1945\nis no longer with us. The United Nations of today must\nembrace the realities of the new millennium. Anachronistic\nstructures and outmoded thinking cannot coexist with\ncurrent needs and perceptions. The phenomenal growth in\nthe membership of the United Nations leads us to hope for\na more democratic, transparent and representative\nOrganization. This is the case in particular with regard to\nthe Security Council, which must reconcile itself to\nundergoing a thorough transformation in both its structure\nand its functions in order to reflect a more equitable\ngeographical representation of developing and developed\ncountries.\nThe sudden outbreak of hostilities between our\nneighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, has greatly dismayed us.\nAs in the case of Somalia, Djibouti has attempted to\nreconcile the different points of view in various ways,\nalthough there are few real signs of hope for a way out of\nthe stalemate. Beyond the tragic loss of lives, displacement\nof people and destruction of property and facilities, the\npsychological wounds inflicted by the tensions and\nhostilities that are dividing these countries suggest that it\nwill be several difficult years before the Horn of Africa\nbecomes once again a region of peace and trust. Both\nleaders understand my frustration \u2014 indeed, my\nexasperation \u2014 at this wasteful, unnecessary and\nseemingly endless conflict. We are confronted by serious\nregional problems and must revive economies that have\nbeen dormant for a long time. We need a new vision, new\nperspectives and a far-sighted approach to deal with\nbilateral differences.\nI urge my friends, the leaders of Ethiopia and\nEritrea, to give peace a chance. Let us end the hostile\npropaganda and provocative rhetoric and replace it with\na genuine desire to engage constructively in finding a\nsolution to this problem. It would be a tragedy if the\nrelentless shuttling between Addis Ababa and Asmara by\nleaders and senior officials of many Governments,\nincluding heads of regional organizations, who have all\ndemonstrated immense goodwill and perseverance and\nexpended time, energy and boundless effort in trying to\nresolve the conflict, were to be taken by some to be\nlargely symbolic. We believe they are more than that. The\nseries of attempts made by a great many mediators and\nfacilitators demonstrates the seriousness of this matter.\nThe many views, opinions, decisions and resolutions\nrelating to this conflict, even if not wholly acceptable to\none or both parties, nevertheless contain significant\nelements that can form the basis of a settlement. It is\nincumbent upon both leaders to go beyond the immediate\nunfortunate problem and to look forward resolutely to a\nbetter and promising future of benefit to all. In the words\nof the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, I\ncall upon the leaders of those countries\n\u201cto practise tolerance and live together in peace with\none another as good neighbours\u201d.\nThere is no doubt that the speed of globalization and\nthe expansion and integration of the international\neconomy have brought immense benefits to many\ncountries and positive changes in the living condition of\nmany people. However, several countries and their\npopulations, particularly in the developing world, are\nfacing marginalization and hopelessness because they are\nunable to adapt to the rapid pace of integration. The least\ndeveloped countries in particular require special attention\nso that they do not slip further into the abyss of poverty\nand disintegration.\nThe World Economic Survey 1997 shows that Africa\nwill have to demonstrate still higher and more sustained\nrates of growth in order to alleviate widespread poverty\n3\n\n\nand reduce high unemployment. Improved and sustained\nmacroeconomic stability and economic reforms have played\nimportant roles in Africa?s recent economic upturn,\nalthough the sacrifices have been great.\nBut Africa must now grapple with the erroneous\nperception by developed countries that private investment\nflows can be a substitute for development assistance, which\nin fact largely bypasses the continent: only 5 per cent of\nsuch assistance goes to Africa as a whole, and only 1 per\ncent to sub-Saharan Africa. Add this to the crippling debt\nservicing costs and it becomes clear that Africa, and in\nparticular the least developed of its countries, is in a\nprecarious financial position. The danger of prolonged, or\nindefinite, marginalization is a real one.\nAs the continent continues to be mired in a series of\ncrises, the much vaunted policy of finding African solutions\nto African problems, which was among the precursors of\nWestern disengagement, seems to be predicated on a\nnumber of premises that are tenuous at best. The fact is that\nAfrica cannot succeed alone; it needs serious, resolute\ncommitment to Africa?s economic recovery on the part of\nthe industrial countries, along with a determination to\nprevent and resolve conflicts. It is important to note that\nAfrican countries have played an important role in the\nefforts to maintain and restore peace in Liberia and in\nSierra Leone. That is a positive development that we cannot\nfail to welcome. But we are saddened by the resurgence of\nhostilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We\nwarn all involved in the current crisis that pursuing\nindividual military agendas in the Congo is not in the\ninterest of the long-term stability of the region or of Africa\nas a whole. The territorial integrity of that country must be\nrespected, and no country in the region or in any other\nregion of Africa should try to place any of its neighbours\nunder its thumb.\nSince 1991, at the time of Somalia?s implosion,\nDjibouti, both independently and through the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), has\ntirelessly sought to restore peace and security to that\ncountry. In 1991, we organized the first two national\nreconciliation conferences; then the United Nations began\nits extensive operations. Subsequently, Ethiopia, with a\nmandate from IGAD and the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), organized a series of meetings that led to the\nSodere agreement. Other countries, the League of Arab\nStates, various Arab States and other organizations have\nalso made serious reconciliation efforts during this period.\nEvery year, new conferences were held and new agreements\nsigned, none of which were implemented. This shows that\nthe faction leaders had learned the technique of making\npeople believe in a reconciliation that would last about as\nlong as their return flights home.\nSince the United Nations departure and\ndisengagement from Somalia in the mid-1990s, the\ninternational community has come to remember only a\n\u201cfailed operation\u201d and a \u201cfailed State\u201d. But that devastated\ncountry needs the United Nations to become engaged\nonce again. Somalia deserves greater interest and attention\nthan it now gets. This is not solely a regional or even an\nAfrican or Arab problem; Somalia was and continues to\nbe an international disaster. Its neighbours have made\nenough concessions, and they stand to sacrifice and risk\neven more. It is therefore fair to say that it is not easy or\ntolerable to continue living in a no-peace-no-war situation.\nImagine having to life beside a neighbour without laws,\nwithout a government, without a central authority.\nAfter seven years of bickering, the faction leaders\nhave nothing new to offer. Give the people of Somalia,\nwith the support of the international community, a chance\nto elect leaders of their choice, by stages, both regionally\nand nationally \u2014 without threats and without blackmail.\nIt is not impossible that the evolving new approach of\nsetting up regional administrations or \u201cmini-states\u201d could\nenhance security and stability and shape the future\npolitical structure of Somalia, so long as they do not\ncompromise the country?s unity.\nWe are deeply saddened by the lack of progress\nunder the peace agreements in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nIsrael is continuing to seize Palestinian property; engaging\nin relentless settlement activities in the West Bank;\nimposing intransigent rule over East Jerusalem; and\nillegally and unilaterally extending the boundaries of the\nmunicipality of Jerusalem.\nIsrael?s arbitrary and coercive measures, which\ninclude the suspension of the Palestinians? rights to enter,\nwork, trade, reside, remain, build or travel in the country,\nhave created intolerable uncertainties and a difficult\nsituation. We demand that Israel immediately withdraw its\ntroops, put a stop to settlement and construction in the\nsettlements, and desist from taking unilateral decisions\nthat undermine the peace efforts, as called for by the Oslo\npeace accords.\nWe are one with the legitimate aspirations of the\nPalestinian people to establish an independent State and\nto live side by side with Israel in peace and within secure\nborders. Above all, we hope that Israel will heed the call\n4\n\n\nby the international community to establish comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East on the basis of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nThe relentless fratricidal war in Afghanistan shows no\nsign of abating, despite intense and continuing international\nefforts. The people of Afghanistan have suffered immensely\nand are on the verge of losing all hope of any political\nsolution to this crisis. In the last two years there has been\nan increase in violence, intolerance, and the abuse of\nhuman rights, in particular against women. We hope that\nthe risk of tensions escalating as a result of the murder of\nIranian diplomats will be defused through the ongoing\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General.\nThe international community has often turned to\nsanctions in order to combat violations of international law\nor to punish uncontrolled criminal behaviour. In practice,\nhowever, the application of sanctions is often too general\nand broad, serving particular political interests. Real targets\nor target groups are not affected, and it is the innocent\npopulation at large that suffers as a result of such blind\nembargoes. Once sanctions become personalized or are used\nto serve as weapons to serve and protect powerful interests,\nthey cease to have time limits or clear indications as to\nwhen their requirements have been met. Their original\npurpose is lost and the sanctions assume a life of their own.\nThe end result is a climate of frustration and non-\ncompliance with a resultant considerable squandering of\ncredibility. Without a sense of limits, purpose and fairness,\nthe exercise then becomes futile and counter-productive.\nBehind the broad global problems facing our planet\nEarth, some of which I have mentioned briefly, lie specific\nareas and countries which merit particular attention. For\nexample, there is universal concern about the economic and\nfinancial crisis assailing Asia and its implications for the\nrest of the world. It is difficult to comprehend that the\nAsian miracle we had all come to marvel at should collapse\nso abruptly, with grave consequences for Governments,\nbusinessmen and peoples. Many of the countries involved\nrisk falling into severe recession. Whatever the explanation\nfor this crisis, this experience proves that there are real\nperils in the free flow of international capital. The danger\nis incalculable, forcing serious revision of some of our\nlong-term development plans.\nIt is also disturbing to see so many of the resources of\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) going towards\nrescuing large international banks and financial institutions\nthat recklessly and of their own volition placed their funds\nin sectors where restraint and control were needed. Now we\nmust all wonder who will be the next to suffer a flight of\ncapital and who will help to bail them out. There is\nundoubtedly a strong case for creating a better mechanism\nto regulate international standards for financial\nmanagement and capital flows.\nThe task of engendering a national sense of identity\nand cohesion and shared values against a backdrop of\nturbulence and instability is one of the core challenges of\nnation-building. In Djibouti, we have had our ups and\ndowns. We continue to face daunting economic\ndifficulties, aggravated by the presence of a great number\nof refugees, which has overwhelmed our limited means\nand severely strained our social services.\nI am proud to say that Djibouti, despite these\nobstacles, has established itself as a nation, a responsible\nmember of the international community. Since gaining\nindependence over 20 years ago, we have effected a\nseries of changes aimed at the attainment of better\nstandards of living and have undertaken to found a culture\nof democracy and tolerance. The process of accelerated\npolitical and economic change continues, however fragile\nit may be.\nI believe in the concept that there should be\nopponents but not enemies. That is why tolerance,\ncompassion and forbearance have guided my actions as\nleader of my country. We have pursued a policy of\nregional and ethnic inclusion, and have long recognized\nthe concept of diversity in unity.\nDjibouti?s approach to regional affairs has always\nbeen based on mutual respect, moderation and\ncooperation. We believe that the countries of the Horn of\nAfrica must unite to confront the problems of poverty,\nconflicts and underdevelopment within the framework of\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development whose\nrevitalization is crucial.\nAt the international level, we credibly contributed to\nthe maintenance of peace and security during our\nmembership in the Security Council in 1993 and 1994. As\nan extension of this, we have participated in international\npeacekeeping missions to bring peace and stability to\ncountries in the throes of conflict.\nIn the context of the current global financial turmoil,\none thing is certain: yesterday?s international institutions\ncannot cope with today?s intensity, magnitude and\nrapidity, which demand greater openness and\ntransparency. Djibouti therefore joins in the overwhelming\n5\n\n\ncall for a comprehensive overhaul of the International\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank so that they can\nadequately respond to the financial calamity we are\nexperiencing. They must also be fully equipped to mount a\ndetermined attack on poverty, growing hopelessness and\nunderdevelopment. I pray that the new millennium will\nbring us more stability, understanding and harmony among\nnations, and among peoples within nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds\nof the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on\nall of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding\ncollectively to new challenges and in establishing a\nreliable system of international security and stability once\nwe have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes\naccumulated during the century about to end.\nThis is not only possible, it is the imperative of our\ntimes!\nA well-known Russian proverb says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you would\nlive in the world, live in peace\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. It contains a highly\nphilosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will\nlive in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve\nemerging problems through peaceful, political means.\nStates will live in peace and harmony once they have\nrecognized their interrelationship and interdependence and\nstarted to seek collective responses to the challenges of\ntheir times.\nExperience confirms the truth of this popular\nwisdom. The most recent example is the sharp\naggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis\nwhich has besieged many countries, including Russia,\nwhich is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The\ncurrent upheaval in the world financial markets can be\novercome only by joint efforts that do not pursue\nunilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global\neconomic stability. Interaction of States in this process,\nincluding within the framework of the United Nations,\nmust, on principle, be raised to a new level.\nAs for Russia, after overcoming an acute political\ncrisis, the country\u00e2s President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the\nGovernment and the leading political forces are making\nvigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial\nsituation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be\nfound.\nFrom this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not\ndeviate from the path of reform and will do its best to\npass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to\npreserve the democratic progress that has been made but\nalso to augment it.\nLikewise, Russia\u00e2s foreign policy will remain\nconsistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards\nbuilding a democratic multipolar world, ensuring\ninteraction with other States in the interests of settling\ninternational problems by political means and developing\nbroad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.\n20\n\n\nWe are convinced that the problems before the world,\nno matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the\nbasis of strict observance of international law and close\ninteraction among States. Multilateral organizations and\nmechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.\nAbove all, this applies to the United Nations, which\ncontinues to be the sole universal international\npeacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than\nany other world body to reach agreements on how to settle\nconflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying\nsocial and economic causes. It is important for United\nNations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional\norganizations.\nWe highly value the level of interaction that now\nexists between the United Nations and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a\nreliable partner in addressing complex European problems,\nas well as interaction with the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The\ninternational community has developed a unique arsenal of\npolitical and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of\nevery international problem. It must be put to effective use.\nCoercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last\nresort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of\ninternational law and above all by the United Nations\nCharter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of\nlaw rather than the law of force in international affairs.\nThe fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this\nyear was settled precisely by political means, through the\njoint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic\nevidence that the potential inherent in constructive and\nactive diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying\nexclusively on military force.\nA new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us\ndeeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious\nconsequences for regional and international stability. No\ndoubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full\ncooperation with the United Nations Special Commission\nand the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\nimplement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the\nother hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the\nsituation related to the elimination of Iraq\u00e2s weapons of\nmass destruction and answer the question of whether or not\nthat country still poses a threat to regional and overall\ninternational security after seven years of work carried out\nthere by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the\nworld community is required today to finally unblock this\ncrisis situation.\nPolitical logic must prevail over the logic of force in\nour search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in\nKosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the\nKosovo conflict might lead to a major war with\nunpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and\nEurope at large. It is our firm belief that a political\nsolution is the only possible way of settling the problem\nof Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict\nrespect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia.\nThe bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of\nthe fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary\ngains can be obtained in that country through the use of\narms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for\npolitical solutions, with the United Nations playing a\ncentral role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,\nformation of an efficient central Government recognized\nby all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistan\u00e2s\nterritorial integrity and independence can realistically be\naccomplished.\nCollective political efforts are required to give a\nsecond wind to the Middle East peace process. In our\nview, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or\nproposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has\nstymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should\nnot be ignored that even if the Middle East process has\nlong-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has\nconsistently advocated the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State through political means and\nnegotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable\nrights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable\nassurance of Israel\u00e2s legitimate security interests can be\nrealized.\nIn a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the\nSyrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results\nalready achieved.\nThe recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie\ncase has been a major accomplishment of the international\ncommunity. The adoption by the Security Council of a\nrelevant resolution was possible due to the constructive\napproach taken by the parties concerned \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the United\nStates, Great Britain, France and Libya \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as due\nto diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,\nwhich were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed\nwithout delay to its implementation.\n21\n\n\nArguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the\nefforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The\nUnited Nations must play a leading role to this end.\nFailure of the international community to fully\nextinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in\nAfrica in recent years is a source of growing concern.\nMoreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that\ncontinent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to\nachieve full coordination between the United Nations and\nAfrica\u00e2s regional organizations have not succeeded. That is\nwhy the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on\nAfrica should focus on shaping a strong common stance\ncapable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of\nAfrica\u00e2s latest developments.\nFor objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention\nto settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or\nTrans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nnamely, promoting a political settlement and helping build\nlasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia\nhas undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is\ndoing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can\nprove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show\ngoodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more\nmeaningful international backing, above all from the United\nNations and the OSCE.\nWhile making strong efforts to settle regional crises,\nwe should not lose sight of global problems, some of which\nhave acquired a new dimension in the last year.\nWe cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of\na real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the\ninternational community to encourage all countries to\naccede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty. We welcome Brazil\u00e2s accession to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\nRussia is committed to the idea of continued reduction\nof nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic\nstability at lower armament levels. In this context, we\nattach particularly great importance to the Russian-\nAmerican interaction in the area of reducing strategic\noffensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,\nMr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian\nGovernment, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to\nseek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II\nTreaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to\nratify all documents related to START II.\nAccession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear\narms control process is now on the agenda. We urge\ncareful consideration of a proposal made by President\nBoris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy\nnuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of\ntheir national territories. We note with satisfaction the\nrecent consensus decision in the Conference on\nDisarmament to start negotiations banning production of\nnuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of\nspecial significance is that the decision was supported by\nStates that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are\nconvinced that such a ban would be a further necessary\nstep in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation\nregime and nuclear disarmament.\nThe nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear\nterrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed\nto be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our\nregret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the\ninternational community is required to prevent the real-\nlife emergence of that new form of terrorism.\nAccelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts\nof nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it\ncan be adopted by the General Assembly at the current\nsession, has become particularly relevant.\nRussia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its\nfirm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. International terrorism is one of the most\ndangerous global challenges to international stability. It\ncan be successfully combated only through united action\nby all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of\nmaking unilateral power moves, shall we be able to\nsucceed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.\nMilitant separatism has become another factor that\ndestabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on\nextremist methods in the struggle for the national rights\nof minority groups within multinational States, separatism\noften finds itself in league with terrorism and religious\nfanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal\nconflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get\ninvolved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional\ncrises.\nMore than two and a half thousand national\nminorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of\nthem to aspire to a State entity of their own, the\ndisastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be\nimagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that\nin mind.\n22\n\n\nThe fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted\naction. We must focus on the practical implementation of\nthe relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat\nadopted by the General Assembly at its special session.\nThe international community should take a common\nstand in implementing the provisions of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary\noccurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is\nneeded in respect of those States which, under various\npretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and\nfreedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards\ninvolving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level\nof Government policy discrimination against a part of the\npopulation. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to\nthe fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking\ncitizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia\nand Estonia. The international community, and above all the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nshould closely watch the situation in those countries.\nI have touched upon a few of the important issues\nwhich the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this\ntime. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of\njoint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal\nwith urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that\nend, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms\nand adapt them to today\u00e2s needs. That is exactly what the\nprocess of reforming the United Nations, launched by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The\nrationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the\nOrganization.\nThat is the angle from which we approach the ongoing\ndiscussion on the work of the Security Council. No one\nshould question the Security Council\u00e2s primary\nresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of\npeace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its\neffectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well\nas to build on internal cohesion and work coordination\nmethods developed in recent years.\nI should like to reaffirm that we support the\nimplementation of reforms and changes in United Nations\nmechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the\nUnited Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps\ntaken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United\nNations auspices, of the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court. Russia\u00e2s initiative to launch a discussion on\nways to achieve international information security serves\nthe same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset\nthreats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science\nand technology for purposes incompatible with the\nmaintenance of international security.\nI wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of\nadapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of\nan individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for\nexample, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in\nmind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security\nCouncil, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive\nmeasures. We must not allow a precedent to be created\ninvolving the use of military potential in a crisis situation\nwithout the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is\nobvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion\nof the existing system of international relations, whose\ncentral element is the United Nations.\nUnited Nations sanctions as an instrument of\ninternational coercion also require a highly balanced\napproach. When introduced by the Security Council,\nsanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that\nmay be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.\nThey should not destabilize the economic situation in the\ncountry subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.\nIt is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the\nimposition of sanctions and their duration and the\nprocedures for easing and lifting them.\nIn short, individual elements of the United Nations\nmechanism need improvement and retooling. But we\nshould go about it with a full sense of responsibility,\nmindful of the medical profession\u00e2s rule that unnecessary\nharm is to be avoided at all costs.\nEvery session of the General Assembly is, in a way,\na milestone event. Each session is expected to make a\ntangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems\nconfronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether\nor not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly\nlives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It\nwill depend on all of us whether or not joint effective\nsteps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful\nworld, a world free from war and conflict and from\nfinancial and economic upheaval, a world built on the\nprinciples of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia stands\nready to work with others to attain these goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly has\nunanimously chosen Mr. Opertti to direct the work of its\nfifty-third session. Echoing previous speakers, I should\nlike to congratulate him, as I consider his election a\ntribute to his personal qualities as a diplomat and a\nstatesman. Through me, Madagascar is pleased to express\nits best wishes for the success of his mission.\nHis predecessor, whose competence we valued, was\nable to rely on our cooperation throughout his term of\noffice; and Mr. Opertti may also be assured of our\ncomplete support in his efforts to accomplish his task\nsuccessfully.\nMadagascar reiterates its encouragement and support\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his quest for\nways and means to make our Organization increasingly\ndynamic.\nThe great family of the United Nations is meeting\nonce again, as it does every year, to reflect collectively on\nthe situation in the world so as to lay the foundations for\n19\n\n\na better existence, one which is safer and more equitable,\nin spite of all our differences and divergences.\nMadagascar reaffirms its support for the United\nNations though its presence every year at this annual\ngathering. For us, this forum for exchanging views\nrepresents the first, universal bastion against injustice and\nviolence in the world, and it is the best tool for\nsafeguarding peace and security and for the promotion of\nprogress.\nIn the light of the statements made here, globalization\nundoubtedly constitutes the backdrop for our many concerns\nat this end of the century. With all its advantages,\ndisadvantages and disappointments, and transcending the\nlimits of the economic framework, globalization is today\nexpressing itself in terms of insecurity.\nInsecurity is spreading virtually everywhere, in many\nforms and manifestations. Insecurity is being globalized,\nand whenever a man dies \u2014 whether it be in a war, or as\na bombing victim, or in a cold-blooded massacre, or simply\nin his sickbed \u2014 somewhere children cry, women suffer by\nthe hundreds, by the thousands, by the millions. And death\nis more than ever part of our daily lives. This is why today\nwe are focusing our attention on the problems of insecurity\nand on the need to rally our efforts for the maintenance of\npeace.\nThe international community is now confronting\nsituations that jeopardize peace and security and that\nthreaten the sustainable development of nations. In many\nparts of the world, civil wars, inter-State conflicts, border\ndisputes, and ethnic, tribal and religious confrontations\nresurface, bringing suffering, poverty, political instability\nand marginalization, be it in Kosovo, the Comoros, the\nGreat Lakes region or elsewhere.\nAdded to this is the persistence of new threats, such\nas international terrorism, organized crime, corruption, the\nproliferation of narcotic drugs and the deterioration of the\nenvironment. Access to weapons of mass destruction is\nbecoming easier and easier. The proliferation of the light-\nweapons industry and the widespread use of those weapons\nare becoming a major scourge for most countries.\nInsecurity is economic as well as social. In the era of\ntechnological progress and of the spectacular growth in\nworld food production, whole regions are experiencing\nfamine and malnutrition. One quarter of the world\u2019s\npopulation is still living in poverty. Millions of children\nunder the age of five continue to die of diseases, and major\nsectors of society are cut off from education and from\nbasic health care. About 180 million children under the\nage of 14 are obliged to work; the less fortunate have no\nalternative except sexual exploitation, and for many young\npeople unemployment is the only prospect for the future.\nSimilarly, a large number of women cannot to this very\nday exercise their fundamental rights. Many remain\nvictims of domestic violence, social injustice, deliberate\nmassacres or armed conflict.\nMoreover, the financial upheaval that has afflicted\nSouth-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has shaken\nthe international economic system. It is true that global\ninformation networks have reduced both distances and\ntime, but at the same time they have contributed to\nincreasing scientific, cultural and moral insecurity.\nComputer viruses have become as dangerous as nuclear,\nbiological and chemical weapons. All of this illustrates\nthe magnitude and the drawbacks of globalization, as well\nas the scope of the interdependence of States.\nFifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the rights and freedoms inherent in the dignity and\nworth of the human person are still often violated, and we\nwitness the burgeoning of new challenges \u2014 challenges\nthat are ever different and that require well-adapted and\nbetter-planned strategies. It is obvious that no State in the\nworld can guarantee each of its citizens material and\nspiritual well-being in conditions of peace and full respect\nfor the most basic rights and freedoms.\nWhile in the recent past \u2014 and more specifically in\n1985, from this same rostrum \u2014 emphasis was placed on\nthe balance of forces, in general, and on nuclear parity, in\nparticular, everyone today unanimously recognizes that\nsecurity cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity,\nwhich implies spectacular changes in international\nrelations. Evidence of this recognition is the forthcoming\nentry into force, on 1 March 1999, of the international\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction, as well as the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones.\nFor its part, Madagascar, which has never deviated\nfrom its commitment to disarmament and which is, in this\nrespect, a signatory of a number of international\nConventions, is gratified at the prospects of the\nnegotiation of a cut-off treaty on fissile material for\nmilitary purposes in the framework of the Conference on\nDisarmament in Geneva.\n20\n\n\nWe also welcome the call for the holding in the near\nfuture of an international conference on the complete\nelimination of nuclear weapons, a call made by the heads\nof State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned\nCountries who met recently in Durban. Along the same\nlines, Madagascar of course associates itself with the\nproposal made by President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, the current\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nconcerning the convening in the year 2000 of a summit\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations with\na view to the formulation by the international community\nof a joint response to the problem of terrorism.\nLike other States, on 18 July, in Rome, Madagascar\nsigned the Statute of the International Criminal Court, as\nwell as the Final Act of the Diplomatic Conference of\nPlenipotentiaries.\nIt would be appropriate to consider the question of\nsecurity through a multidimensional approach encompassing\nmilitary, economic and social aspects at various levels \u2014\ninternational, regional and national.\nPoverty and the persistence of imbalances that divide\nthe world into developed countries, developing countries,\nleast developed countries, poor and indebted countries, are\nfactors contributing to tension and obstacles to the\nestablishment of a genuine and lasting peace. This, in any\nevent, is the reality in Africa, my continent.\nThe Cairo Declaration of 1993 established the primary\nobjective of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution in Africa. Nonetheless, without\nthe active support of the international community, these\nactions would remain ineffective. Security Council\nresolution 1170 (1998), on the holding of regular ministerial\nmeetings in order to evaluate actions undertaken for peace\nin Africa, should therefore be welcomed. For Madagascar,\nit is a question of confirming the will to coordinate actions\nof the United Nations with the pan-African organization and\nwith regional mechanisms.\nWhile awaiting an appropriate mobilization of the\nresources needed for the effective implementation of actions\nin the framework of the Agenda for Development, it seems\nto us vital that the developing countries make their\ncontribution by proposing the establishment of a mechanism\nto help them attain their shared aspirations and affirm their\nsolidarity.\nIt is in this spirit that the Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\nmeeting at Durban, considered a proposal to establish,\nwithin the Non-Aligned Movement, a mechanism\nconsisting of three funds financed by our own resources,\nup to perhaps 0.1 per cent of gross national product or a\npercentage of export income. The funds thus obtained\nwould be capitalized through investment in international\nfinancial markets.\nFor Madagascar, this mechanism would help\nintegrate the activities of developing countries into the\nprocess of financial globalization and would help resolve,\nat least in part, their financial and debt problems, in\ntandem with the actions undertaken by the international\ncommunity and the financial institutions. A large number\nof speakers during that session recommended an\nevaluation of the capacity of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions to adapt to current realities. The three-fund\nmechanism could be among the basic documents for joint\nreflection on a new global financial architecture.\nIn implementing the resolutions of the international\ncommunity, it is a key responsibility of each country to\ncreate a climate conducive to lasting peace and economic\ngrowth. Among the elements of this responsibility are the\nestablishment of regulations that are in keeping with\nagreed aspirations, good governance, the creation of\nadequate systems for follow-up and monitoring, and\nrespect for the rules of democracy. In the present context\nof global economic liberalization, every development\nactor has its own role to play, including the State as the\nprotector of the fundamental rights of its people and of its\nsovereignty and as a catalyst for development\nprogrammes.\nMadagascar, whose Constitution and national laws\nare based on the principles of the United Nations Charter,\nendorses those values. In that connection, we are engaged\nin the process of democratization, good governance and\nthe rule of law, along with economic and structural\nreforms, to lead our country towards credible partnership\nin the international system. Our authorities are now\ncommitted to implementing recovery programmes aimed\nat stepping up the struggle against poverty and at creating\na climate conducive to the complete fulfilment of the\ncitizen.\nThe institutional aspects of this programme include\nthe establishment of autonomous provinces and of\ninstitutions provided for in the Constitution, and the\ncontinued reform of the civil service and the judiciary\nsystem.\n21\n\n\nIn the economic sphere, the State is continuing to pull\nout of the production sector, and will be doing all in its\npower to create an environment of vigour and competition\nand to put financial administration on a sound footing\nthrough the creation of bodies to regulate sector-based\nactivities.\nFinally, in the social area, public expenditures will\nreflect our priorities: education, health and safety, and\nsecurity. We are devoting special attention to programmes\nto make the most disadvantaged segments of the population\naware of their own responsibilities.\nAlthough the implementation of this programme\ndepends first and foremost on Madagascar\u2019s own efforts, it\nis obvious that there are limits on our resources for\nguaranteeing a better quality of life for our citizens and\nthus for protecting their rights. The strengthening of\ninternational partnership should therefore be viewed not\nonly from the financial but also from the scientific and\ntechnological standpoints, so that all countries may hope for\nan equal chance of success. Of that I am convinced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me to extend to\nyou, Sir, my delegation?s sincere congratulations on your\nelection to preside over the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you all the best in carrying out\nyour duties. Let me also express my appreciation for his\nexcellent work to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session.\nAs of today 462 days remain until the end of this\ncentury \u2014 a century which has recorded many phases in\nthe development of the world. There have been times of\nconfrontation and times of partnership, times of\nprotectiveness and times of openness.\nSeven years ago the walls of separation between the\nnations of East and West were torn down, creating\nopportunities for closer cooperation and economic\nintegration. This also opened doors for nations to promote\ngeneral welfare, mutual understanding and respect and the\nbuilding of trust and confidence in one another.\nAs has been said about this moment in history, it is\nnot so much that the borders between States are now open\nand can be freely crossed, but that they can be transcended.\nDistances and borders now have limited significance; the\nglobe has become a universal village in its own right.\nToday, the world economy appears to be sliding into\na deep crisis. The countries that are suffering the most are\nthe poorest. While I realize that globalization entails risks\nand challenges for economies and societies, I am convinced\nthat there is no alternative. The only credible formula for a\nviable global economy is the promotion of freer trade\nthrough the abolition of trade barriers and the pursuit of\nsustained economic and democratic reform. Once starting\non this path of reform, as difficult as it may be, there can\nbe no stepping aside for shortsighted political consideration.\nEstonia?s success is living proof of this.\nAlong with many other States, Estonia began its\ntransition from a Communist regime to democracy and\nfrom a State-controlled economy to a free market in 1991.\nBy 1997, Estonia had the highest economic growth rate in\nEurope, and preliminary figures for 1998 indicate that\ngrowth continues to be strong. Estonia?s inclusion among\nthe six countries to begin accession negotiations with the\nEuropean Union is a recognition of its achievements in\nbuilding a civil society and a well-functioning market\neconomy.\nIn my country, we are proud of the European Union\ninvitation. We regard the European integration process as\namong the most challenging yet most rewarding\nendeavours for our continent, today and in the distant\nfuture. European integration is not simply an effort to\nprovide our citizens with the tools for success in a\nglobalizing world; it is also a catalyst for greater openness\nthroughout the continent. We are convinced that pursuing\nmembership is in itself a strong guarantee for stable\ndevelopment, as it provides all applicants with a viable\nroad map to reform.\nEstonia greatly appreciates the help provided by the\nUnited Nations, other international organizations and a\nnumber of bilateral donors during the difficult early years\nof transition. Now that Estonia has entered into the post-\ntransitional stage of its development, we believe it is time\nto start paying back. During the last eight years our\nGovernment and people have accumulated a wealth of\nexperience and know-how on transition to a market\ndemocracy. We want to share this knowledge with\ncountries at an early stage of their reforms, starting from\nbuilding up a well-functioning border guard and finishing\nwith successful monetary reform. Learning how to teach\nand provide support is the final lesson before graduation,\nand this should be the goal of every reform country.\nAt any one time, there are 15 or 16 armed conflicts\nfrom around the world on the Security Council?s agenda.\nConflicts between and within States spread from Europe\nto Africa, from the Middle East to Asia. These conflicts\nare often driven by poor socio-economic conditions or\nethnic nationalism. Estonia, recognizing the primary role\nof the United Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security, supports efforts to maintain and\nstrengthen the Organization?s capacity to organize and\neffectively conduct its peacekeeping operations. In\naddition, we trust that the phasing out of gratis personnel,\nas mandated by the General Assembly, if handled\nproperly, will not adversely affect the functioning of the\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations.\nAs a contributor of personnel, Estonia is committed\nto continuous participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. We are preparing to dispatch the\njoint Estonian- Latvian-Lithuanian battalion known as\nBALTBAT for its inaugural tour of duty in the near\nfuture. I would like to extend our thanks to all nations\nwhich have supported the establishment and formation of\nBALTBAT.\nEstonia also intends to continue its involvement in\nBosnia and Herzegovina within the United Nations\nInternational Police Task Force (IPTF). As a conflict\n31\n\n\nprevention measure, it welcomes and supports the enhanced\ncooperation of the United Nations with regional\norganizations or arrangements. In particular, deeper\ncooperation with the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) has great potential.\nThis year has already provided the international\ncommunity with a number of landmark events. Among\nnotable achievements were the twentieth special session,\non the reduction and prevention of the illicit production,\nsale and demand of narcotic substances, and the adoption\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Estonia\ntrusts that this fifty-third session of the General Assembly\nwill reinforce the momentum captured in June and July in\nboth New York and Rome, respectively.\nOn the other hand, the world community has\nwitnessed a number of vicious terrorist attacks. It is time\nfor everybody to understand a basic fact: terrorism is not\npolitics; it is not religion \u2014 it is murder. Estonia deplores\nall terrorist activities wherever they occur, whatever the\nform or manifestation. We sympathize with all nations\nthat have suffered these acts and call for even stronger\nsolidarity to fight against such attacks.\nWe also must acknowledge that even on the eve of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, one of the major\naccomplishments of our Organization, the world is still\nhome to gross violations of human rights on all six\ncontinents. We therefore call for a sustained effort of the\nGeneral Assembly, in close cooperation with regional\norganizations, to address this issue and to find the most\neffective mechanisms for early warning to identify and\nstop these violations.\nFinally, a few words concerning the United Nations\nreform. We support reform based on the proposals by the\nSecretary-General. Estonia strongly believes that the aim\nof this reform must be to come to grips with a changing\nworld as well as the principle of cost-effectiveness."

        "file_text": "Allow me first, Sir, to\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am sure that\n5\n\n\nyour leadership constitutes a guarantee of continued\nsuccess.\nAt the same time, I would like to express my\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for his\nexcellent leadership during the fifty-second session.\nIt is a special pleasure for me to address the Assembly\nin this session, which coincides with the fiftieth anniversary\nof the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights.\nAlthough decades have passed, this document remains\nprofoundly relevant to our world today. In fact, its\nstandards continue to be an essential guide for evaluating\nthe development and emancipation of human society. The\nMember countries of the United Nations should be proud of\nthis document\u2019s lasting legacy.\nWhile affirming the ongoing importance of the\nDeclaration, I would like to stress the need for the UN\u2019s\nsystem of values to undergo an ongoing harmonization with\nnew challenges. In this framework, on behalf of the\nGovernment of Albania, I commend the efforts made under\nthe leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in\nthe process of reform of our Organization. We hail the\npositive results achieved so far, and encourage the United\nNations to continue to respond concretely to the challenges\nof the twenty-first century.\nNearly three weeks ago Albania once again attracted\nthe attention of the United Nations due to the violent events\naimed at striking a blow against the fragile democratic\ninstitutions that were under the process of restoration from\nthe deep crisis my country passed through last year. Certain\npolitical forces that lost their power in last year\u2019s free\nelections obviously encouraged the attack and occupation of\nthe main State institutions.\nThat attempt to overthrow violently the legitimate\nAlbanian Government was condemned by the whole\ndemocratic world, which strongly supported the President\nof the Republic in his endeavour to reestablish the political\nequilibrium that had been deeply disturbed and to guarantee\nthe normal and democratic functioning of State powers and\ninstitutions. We highly appreciate this, and thank the\ninternational community for the support offered to Albania\nduring its difficult days, and we welcome the establishment\nof the group of Friends of Albania. We view this as an\nimportant instrument in our common efforts for the stability\nof Albania and the consolidation of State structures and\ninstitutions.\nWe are conscious of the difficulties and negative\nphenomena with which we are coping. We are painfully\naware that the civilian population of Albania continues to\nbe considered the most armed in Europe. This is a reality\nwhich we have to face every moment. Taking into\naccount the threat that this poses not only to Albania but\nalso to the security of the region, our Government has\nappealed the United Nations for assistance in this regard.\nAllow me on this occasion to thank the Secretary-General\nfor the seriousness with which he has dealt with this\nproblem, and the Under-Secretary-General for\nDisarmament Affairs, Mr. Dhanapala, for the mission he\nled to Albania. I want to express our readiness to work\ntogether with the United Nations to collect the weapons\nwhich fell into the hands of the civilian population during\nthe political unrest of 1997.\nI want to state that my Government is working\ndiligently to establish the long-term rule of law in our\ncountry. Through lengthy deliberations among Albania\u2019s\npolitical forces, we have made an extensive endeavour to\ndraft a constitution that recognizes the need to share\npolitical power and to secure human rights. It is my\nsincere hope that by the end of this year the Albanian\npeople will be able to express their views on the proposed\ndraft constitution. The adoption of a constitution ratified\nby the people of Albania that recognizes the fundamental\nrule of law and protects liberties will prepare Albania for\ncomplete integration into international structures. Most\nimportant, this path offers the best and brightest hope for\nour country.\nI want also to address Albania\u2019s economic situation.\nRebuilding the economy has been the highest of priorities\nfor the Albanian Government, especially since the fall of\nthe pyramid schemes which led to widespread micro- and\nmacroeconomic collapse and to the impoverishment of\nmany Albanians. Our response to this crisis was direct\nand decisive: in exposing the deceit of the pyramid\nschemes, in closing down the pyramid structures and in\nrebuilding trust in the Albanian economy. In cooperation\nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World\nBank, the assets of those firms were audited, and we\ninitiated the process of returning liquid assets to\nlegitimate creditors. Now I can declare with conviction\nthat pyramid-scheme-based businesses do not exist in our\ncountry any more. We are working at present to create\nnew, active policies for employment, self-employment and\nprofessional training.\nThe task of rebuilding Albania\u2019s economy constitutes\na great challenge that requires the support of the\n6\n\n\ninternational community. The Government has worked\ndiligently to break down Albania\u2019s decades of isolationism\nand to become part of the world community of nations. The\nmain directions of our policy so far have been the\nfollowing.\nFirst, the engagement of Albania in Euro-Atlantic\nintegration is aimed at the creation of acceptable national\nstandards in accordance with the common Euro-Atlantic\nvalues of common security, human rights standards, and the\npromotion of the liberal market-economy policies.\nSecondly, Albania\u2019s cooperation with the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has also had concrete\nresults, expressed in successful cooperation, in the\nframework of the Partnership for Peace, on the qualification\nof the Albanian army and police. The first Albanian\ncompany of peacekeepers has in fact made tangible\nprogress in that direction.\nAnd thirdly, our cooperation with the European Union,\nthe Council of Europe and the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe has been further strengthened.\nIt includes their assistance not only in the shaping and\nimprovement of Albanian legislation, but also in monitoring\nthe application of common standards. I take this opportunity\nto thank those institutions for their assistance and to express\nonce again the willingness and the political commitment of\nour Government to raise the quality of this cooperation in\nthe future.\nAlbania\u2019s cooperation with the European Union in the\neconomic area remains a basis for multilateral cooperation.\nWe consider membership in the World Trade Organization\nto be vital in furthering the liberalization of Albanian\ntrading markets. In the meantime, we have strengthened our\nrelations with international financial institutions, which have\ncommitted major financial resources to the economic\ndevelopment of Albania.\nOn this occasion, please allow me to express my\ngratitude for the approval of the first United Nations\nDevelopment Programme country cooperation framework\nfor Albania, and my desire for the further strengthening of\ncooperation between Albania and the United Nations\nsystem. Albania now has serious and powerful partners for\nthe development of our country. The Rome and Brussels\nconferences will be followed by another follow-up\nconference in Tirana, at which we will assess our progress\nand make new commitments for the future.\nTurning to matters of international policy, the\nAlbanian Government has devoted much effort to regional\nconcerns. Southeastern Europe has inherited a series of\nproblems which are the political, economic, social,\npsychological and institutional legacy of the communist\nera. However, we are deeply convinced that there are\nways and means to build up confidence, cooperation and\nfriendship among the Balkan nations. Albania has\nembraced enthusiastically all the initiatives which\ncultivate peace and cooperation in southeastern Europe,\nsuch as the Central European Initiative, the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation process, the South-East European\nCooperative Initiative, the Royaumont Platform for Action\nand the process of Balkan cooperation. All these\ninitiatives will contribute to transparency of borders, free\nmovement of goods, people and opinions among the\ncountries of the region, and the setting up of common\nvalues on trade, transport, energy, telecommunication and\nthe environment that will lay down the infrastructure for\nstability and peace in the region.\nTowards this goal, we have worked on substantially\nimproving bilateral relations with our neighbours.\nSignificant steps were taken last year concerning relations\nwith Italy, Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, on which a great number of cooperative\nagreements were signed. Close partnership relations have\ndeveloped with Turkey, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania,\nSlovenia, et cetera.\nAlthough I am underlining these positive and\nencouraging aspects of regional cooperation in general,\nand especially of Albania\u2019s relations with its neighbours,\nwe cannot ignore the fact that in the Balkans there still\nexist enclaves where fundamental human and national\nrights and freedoms, including the right to life, are\nbrutally violated every day. I am, of course, referring here\nto the problem of Kosovo.\nI would like to confirm the conviction of the\nAlbanian Government that during the past months of the\nKosovo crisis, Belgrade has ignored the appeals of the\ninternational community to find an appropriate solution to\nthat situation, and has systematically destroyed the\nalternative of a peaceful solution, thus encouraging the\noption of violence. Some days ago, the Security Council\nadopted its resolution 1199 (1998), attributing the main\nresponsibility and blame for what is happening in Kosovo\nto the authorities in Belgrade. That resolution testified to\nunanimous political will on the part of the international\ncommunity to act strongly to find a peaceful, political\n7\n\n\nsolution to the conflict, and left open the option of using\nother means if failure is repeated.\nWe hope that this time the clear warning given by\nSecurity Council resolution 1199 (1998), the Council\u2019s\nstrong message issued yesterday and the warnings given by\nthe NATO and world leaders, will be the last ones\nnecessary to impose a political solution on the authorities\nin Belgrade, something which they cannot realize by\nthemselves of their own will.\nThe political archives of Belgrade are quite rich with\nfalse manoeuvres and untrue statements. The so-called\nwithdrawal of special Serbian police forces from Kosovo\nand the end of fighting against so-called terrorists is a new\nversion of them. This is an old scenario of a Bosnian type,\nand we Albanians have ample reasons not to believe it.\nWhat is happening today in Kosovo is the story of a\ntragedy foretold. Milosevic\u00b4 has in fact ordered the\nimplementation of his \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d policy against\nAlbanians under the pretext of combating so-called\nAlbanian terrorism. This has so far proved to be a constant\nelement of his strategy. In that way, Serbian propaganda\nhas been trying to justify the indiscriminate attacks,\nmassacres and atrocities of the Yugoslav army against the\nAlbanian population of Kosovo, such as the ones seen\nlately in the media. Newborn children, pregnant women and\nelderly persons have been massacred in a bestial way. The\nAlbanian Government strongly condemns this policy and\nopenly declares that Milosevic\u00b4 should be held accountable\nand responsible for genocide.\nThe Albanian Government urges the following. First,\nthere should be strong and extensive international\nmonitoring and assisting presence in Kosovo. The nature of\nthis presence should be in accordance with the\ndevelopments in the situation there. Secondly, there should\nbe an immediate NATO military intervention for peace\nenforcement in Kosovo, as peaceful measures applied by\nthe international community have so far failed. Thirdly, the\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\nFormer Yugoslavia should start an investigation in\naccordance with her mandate in order to indict Milosevic\u00b4 as\na war criminal.\nThe current conflict in Kosovo, as rightly pointed out\nin the resolutions and presidential statement of the Security\nCouncil, may have a strong spillover danger. The\nneighbouring countries are directly affected not only by the\nwave of refugees, but also by its impact on the ethnic and\npolitical relations inside these countries. We have already\nbeen witness to these effects.\nAlbania has made its position quite clear. We are in\nfavour of an immediate end to the conflict and the\ninitiation of negotiations between Belgrade and Pri\u0161tina\nwith the international involvement of a third party. This\nwould guarantee their success. The negotiations should\ndefine the future status of Kosovo. The Albanian\nGovernment strongly believes that any solution to the\nKosovo crisis should take into consideration and respect\nthe will of its inhabitants for self-determination in\naccordance with the relevant international conventions.\nHumanitarian problems have always been the focus\nof attention of our Organization, which has also gained\nvaluable experience on how to deal with them. I would\nlike to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to one the most\nacute developments which has already been the object of\nattention in United Nations bodies. Thousands of Kosovo\nAlbanians \u2014 women, old people and children \u2014 have\nleft their country and have gone as refugees to Albania,\nMontenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia. Hundreds of thousands of others are now\nhomeless, driven to wander in the forests and mountains\nof Kosovo, constantly facing terror and death; and it is\nnow almost winter.\nIn spite of the known difficulties, the Albanian\nGovernment has taken all possible measures to cope with\nthe difficult situation which was created as a result of the\ninflux of Kosovo refugees in northern Albania. Albania,\nin cooperation with specialized agencies, has actually\ncreated suitable conditions to face the urgent need for\nfood and temporary shelter. We appeal to these agencies\nto continue their assistance until this refugee crisis is\nresolved and Albanians can safely return to their homes.\nWe are convinced that the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council will fulfil their responsibilities in\naccordance with the United Nations Charter in the efforts\nto overcome the Kosovo crisis, which in fact has become\na crisis of the Balkans and Europe. It is high time the\nUnited Nations and other international forums urgently\nintervened for the restoration of peace; otherwise we risk\nhaving a wider conflict.\nOn this occasion, I would like to thank the Security\nCouncil once again for the adoption of resolution 1199\n(1998) and to commend in particular the initiators of that\nresolution, which constitutes an essential step in bringing\npeace to Kosovo and stability to the region.\n8\n\n\nAlbania, like many other countries, is being affected\nby a set of phenomena such as drugs, illegal trafficking and\norganized crime. The Albanian Government has taken\ndetermined measures and is predisposed to cooperate with\nother countries to fight against these social scourges. We\nheld a special session of the General Assembly this year\ndevoted to the fight against drugs, as well as an open\ndebate in the Security Council on children in armed\nconflicts. These efforts testify to the special attention paid\nto these social problems, and our Government hails them.\nWe appreciate the debate held by the Security Council\non Africa, the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa and\nthe engagement of the United Nations system for peace and\ndevelopment in Africa, a continent with incredible natural\nand human potentials.\nMy country also desires a peaceful solution to the\nconflict in the Middle East and the restarting of the\ndialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, in conformity\nwith the relevant international agreements and resolutions\nof Security Council.\nWe believe that the international community has often\nacted insufficiently in punishing the perpetrators of and the\npeople politically responsible for crimes against mankind.\nConsequently, we appreciate the efforts made by the United\nNations for the establishment of an International Criminal\nCourt, and we consider this a process of strengthening the\nconscience of the international community, as well as a step\nforward in creating a collective positive reaction against\nsuch crimes.\nThe Albanian Government is of the opinion that the\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations is an ongoing\nprocess which is affected by the ever changing real world.\nThe United Nations will be better able to face the new\nchallenges of the new millennium if the intergovernmental\ninstitutions of the United Nations become even more\ndemocratic in their structure.\nOne key area of such reform is the Security Council.\nAlbania follows attentively the proceedings of the Working\nGroup for the restructuring of the Security Council and the\nefforts made to find a solution to this question. We are of\nthe opinion that any decision to reform the Security Council\nshould have the widespread support of member countries\nand must take into account the new realities that are\noccurring in international relations.\nThe reform of United Nations, and especially of the\nSecurity Council, will be a reality only if there is a general\nwill to provide the United Nations with the necessary\npolitical support. Only then will this Organization lead\nour world to the common goal of the creation of a global\nsociety of sovereign nations based on the rule of law,\nrespect for human rights, personal and religious liberties,\neconomic prosperity and international peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I come with the greetings\nand warm wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her\nMajesty the Indlovukazi, the Queen Mother, the\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation to all our fellow\nmembers of the United Nations.\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland, I would\nlike to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Opertti\non his unanimous election to the presidency of the fifty-\n9\n\n\nthird session of the General Assembly. We have the fullest\nconfidence in his ability to lead the deliberations of this\nsession, and I can assure him of my delegation?s full\nsupport and cooperation.\nI would like to congratulate his predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on the skill with which he\npresided over the fifty-second session.\nI would also like to commend the work done over the\npast 12 months by our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand the staff of the United Nations Secretariat. We have\nbeen impressed by the strength of their commitment to\nmeet the many challenges facing our Organization, and we\ntake pride in their considerable achievements.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is encouraged by the\nprogress that has been achieved in the reform of the United\nNations. Much credit is due to the Secretary-General and\nhis staff for their implementation of cost-cutting measures\nand the commitment they have shown to creating a more\nefficient Organization.\nFor our part, we believe the membership must provide\nthe financial resources for the Organization to carry out the\ntasks that we ourselves have set. We surely cannot expect\nthe United Nations to meet its existing obligations, let alone\ntake on the new challenges we present to it, if we lag\nbehind in the payment of our dues. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland makes every effort to keep up to date with its\nfinancial obligations in full, on time and without\nconditions \u2014 and we appeal to all our fellow Member\nStates to do the same.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is nevertheless concerned\nat the painfully slow rate of progress in the debate on the\nrestructuring of the Security Council. The delay is\nespecially frustrating when we know that there is global\nconsensus on the need to make the permanent membership\nof the Council more democratic and representative of the\ndeveloping world. This issue has been central to discussions\nduring Non-Aligned Movement summit meetings and\nsuccessive meetings of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU). There continues to be unanimous support for\nchange.\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Swaziland continues to\nsupport the African common position, which calls, among\nother things, for membership of the Security Council to be\nbased on an equitable geographical formula. Africa is\ncalling for two permanent seats, with the full voting and\nveto rights that are enjoyed by the current membership.\nHowever, in the longer term, we believe that the right of\nveto should be the subject of review, as it is not in\naccordance with recognized democratic practices since it\ngives unequal weight to the minority view.\nAs we celebrate the thirtieth year of our\nindependence and the thirtieth birthday of our monarch,\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland is continuing quietly and\npeacefully to develop all aspects of life according to the\nwishes and expectations of our people. Our overall aim is\nto raise the living standards of all our people and to\nensure that access to all the basic requirements of decent\nhuman life is available to all. We have conducted a\nnumber of initiatives aimed at identifying the areas of\nhighest priority for action and we have asked the people\nthemselves to contribute their ideas and views on how we\ncan overcome the challenges we face. We have always\nbelieved that sustainable development will be best\nachieved in our country when there is the involvement,\nsupport and understanding of the whole nation. It is for\nthis reason that we continue to consult the people on\nissues of national importance at open forums, thus giving\nall Swazis the opportunity to make their views known and\nhave them considered.\nThe implementation of our development aims\ninvolves a twin-track approach, with an economic and\nsocial reform agenda covering the shorter term, and a\nnational development strategy to provide an action plan\nfor the next 25 years. Both are the result of the\nrecommendations of the Swazi people themselves and\nreflect the wishes of all Swazis.\nIn a similar vein, and again in response to the\npeople?s request, we are conducting a review of our\nConstitution. His Majesty informed the General Assembly\nlast year of the establishment of the Constitutional\nReview Commission. The whole nation is engaged in this\nvitally important exercise, and I am pleased to inform our\nfellow Members that substantial progress has been made\nover the past 12 months. The end result will truly reflect\nthe will of the people themselves, and we are confident\nthat we will have in place a Constitution that will serve\nthe best interests of all Swazis for many generations to\ncome.\nWe have been most grateful for the support we have\nreceived from the United Nations towards these important\nnation-building processes, and we value highly the\ncontinued support and encouragement from many of our\nfriends and partners in the international community with\nrespect to our development efforts.\n10\n\n\nIn common with almost every country, we find that\nthe issue of unemployment remains our greatest challenge.\nWe recognize that, with the global economic situation\ndeteriorating and the gap between the developed and the\ndeveloping countries widening, the task of creating jobs is\nbecoming more and more difficult. In response to this, we\nhave introduced incentives to attract investment from both\ninternal and external sources, and we have established an\ninvestment promotion authority to act as the catalyst for\nrapid investment growth. Such national initiatives are aimed\nat creating favourable conditions for our people to gain a\ndecent standard of living and to continue to enjoy the peace\nand stability with which we have been blessed throughout\nour history.\nWe have noted with regret that the past 12 months\nhave seen an alarming rise in situations of internal conflict\nand external aggression among many of the Member States.\nFurthermore, there are many instances of situations where\ninternal conflicts have spilled over borders, creating the\npotential for regional instability. The situations in the\nKosovo region of Yugoslavia, and the heightened tension\non the border between Iran and Afghanistan, are just two\nexamples which are of great concern to the international\ncommunity.\nThis worrying trend has resulted in valuable global\nresources being channelled away from economic and social\ndevelopment priorities, and has undermined our collective\nefforts to achieve peace and stability throughout the world.\nAll too many of our fellow human beings are caught\nup in a spiral of seemingly unending violence, with millions\nforced into exile from their own homes, thus becoming the\nlatest statistics among the unfortunate numbers of refugees.\nIn this respect, we urge the international community to\ncontinue to improve its response mechanisms so that\nappropriate action is taken quickly and decisively to prevent\nconflict and to repair the misery caused by it.\nIn a similar vein, the stalling of the peace process in\nthe Middle East continues to frustrate the efforts of those\nwho desire a genuine, lasting peace in that troubled region.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland applauds those nations which\nare working hard to get the process back on track, and we\ncontinue to urge those involved to respect the terms of the\nOslo peace accord as the only basis on which to rebuild the\natmosphere of trust which is so necessary for the process to\nmove forward.\nMeanwhile, on our continent of Africa, the conflicts in\nareas including the Horn of Africa and in countries such as\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Lesotho\nand Guinea-Bissau, are challenging to the full the\ndiplomatic skills of all of us in the international\ncommunity who hope to bring lasting peace to our\ncontinent.\nOf particular concern to us in the southern African\nregion has been the renewal of civil war in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the resumption of\nhostilities in Angola and the very recent disturbances in\nLesotho. Our fellow members will recall the efforts of the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC),\namong others, to find a solution to the distressing\nsituations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nAngola, which are hampering cooperation between\nmember States of the community. In the case of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland believes that the United Nations has a role to\nplay as peacemaker to complement the efforts of SADC\nand the OAU.\nIn all cases, we pray that a solution may be found to\nend the bloodshed, establish a lasting ceasefire and allow\nnegotiations between the opposing sides. We pray that\nsustainable solutions may soon be found to all of Africa?s\nconflict situations and that all our fellow Africans may be\nfree from the sufferings endured by so many for so long.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland applauds the remarkable\nprogress made towards a lasting settlement in Northern\nIreland. We know there is still a long way to go, but,\ngiven the centuries-long history of the Troubles, the\nachievement has been all the more impressive. We also\ncommend those who have contributed to the process, and\nwe salute especially the people of Northern Ireland, who\nchose to take their destiny in their own hands and voted\nfor peace. This provides an excellent example of what is\npossible when there is true commitment to peace from all\nsides in a dispute.\nOur continent?s fresh crises have shown once more\nthat Africa needs to be better prepared to head off\npotential conflicts through timely dialogue and\nnegotiation, and to have available a pool of peacekeepers\nto act where necessary.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral?s report to the Security Council regarding the\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa.\n11\n\n\nIn this regard, we support the concept of an integrated\napproach to conflict resolution on our continent as a way of\nenhancing closer cooperation between Africa and the rest of\nthe world and making the best use of the resources at our\ndisposal.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is already engaged in\nefforts to become more involved in conflict resolution. To\nthis end, we have welcomed the support of the United\nKingdom and of the United States of America towards the\npreparation of our defence force for participation in\npeacekeeping operations in Africa and around the world.\nOf particular concern has been the evidence in the past\nyear of the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and\ntheir use as instruments of aggression and intimidation. We\nin the Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirm the view of the Non-\nAligned Movement that there can be no moral justification\nfor the ownership, manufacture or use of such weapons.\nWe join the majority of States Members of the United\nNations in calling for real commitment by all countries to\nglobal disarmament and to the creation of a world that will\nbe free and safe for future generations. In this respect, we\nurge all nations that have not done so to become parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT).\nIt may be said that the crises we have mentioned so\nfar have been the result of man?s worst qualities and\ntherefore unnecessary and avoidable. The same is not true\nof the many natural disasters that have struck hard at\nnations across the globe, irrespective of development status.\nThe \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o\u201d phenomenon has resulted in a series of\nnatural disasters, the latest example being widespread\nflooding throughout the Americas, Asia, Africa and parts of\nEurope. Meanwhile, ironically, we in southern Africa must\nwait once more to see if we will receive sufficient rain for\nour crops this year.\nThe establishment by the United Nations of the Office\nof Humanitarian Affairs could not have come at a more\nopportune time, and the Kingdom of Swaziland gives its\nfull support for its operations. We hope that its role will\ninclude assistance to Member States to develop emergency\nrelief mechanisms so that we may all be better prepared to\ncope with disasters of all kinds in the future.\nThe Secretary-General recently gave warning of the\ndeteriorating global economic situation and the widening\ngap between rich and poor nations. The crisis in Asia has\nhad a devastating effect on the people of that region, and\nnow all the indications are that the economies of the rest\nof the world will also be adversely affected. The two\ncertainties are that the worst is yet to come, and that it\nwill be the developing world that will be hardest hit.\nIn this interdependent world of ours, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland recognizes the importance of the concept of\npartnership between nations. We agree that no nation can\nafford to remain isolated and that there is an obligation \u2014\nand an economic necessity \u2014 for the more developed\ncountries to support and assist those of us in the\ndeveloping world.\nWe believe that the underlying principle of any\npartnership should be one of mutual respect and\nunderstanding of each partner?s views, beliefs and\nposition. We look forward to working with our partners\nin areas that our people have chosen as their development\npriorities, in an atmosphere of trust and openness, and\nfree from the imposition of conditions that can impact\nnegatively on our capacity to improve.\nThe process of globalization is now well advanced.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that a good deal\nmore time and preparation are needed before we in the\ndeveloping world are ready to cope with the additional\nresponsibilities that globalization will bring.\nThe United Nations provides the ideal forum for\ndiscussion of these matters; let us make full use of our\nOrganization, in an atmosphere of true respect between\npartners, so that the positions of all may be understood\nand appreciated.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland appreciates the efforts of the\nUnited Nations to integrate human rights issues into all its\npolicies and programmes.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has taken and continues\nto take seriously its obligations to its people on human\nrights issues. Furthermore, we support all initiatives aimed\nat improving the status of women, youth and children.\nThey have a vital role to play in the development of a\nnation in all aspects of life. The ongoing constitutional\nreview is, inter alia, promoting the debate on human\nrights issues.\nIt is unfortunate to note that, even as we celebrate 50\nyears of existence of the Universal Declaration of Human\n12\n\n\nRights, there is one nation of 21.8 million people that we\nbelieve is denied the right of membership of the United\nNations. I am referring to the question of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to raise this\nissue because of our conviction that the United Nations\nCharter provides for the representation of all nations of the\nworld. Furthermore, the Republic of China on Taiwan has\nshown very clearly that it is a nation with the willingness\nand capacity to play a prominent and responsible role in\nglobal development affairs, and yet it remains excluded\nfrom the activities of the one truly global development\norganization.\nThe principle of universality, as contained in our\nfounding Charter, provides that all citizens of the world\nhave the right to be heard in these chambers, and yet it is\na fact that as I speak the people of the Republic of China\non Taiwan are not represented here and therefore cannot\ncontribute their resources and expertise for the benefit of\nthe international community through the medium of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has shown itself to\nbe a peace-loving nation, with a high level of political,\neconomic and social development. It has an excellent record\nof supporting development activities throughout the world.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the time has now\ncome to restore its rightful membership of the United\nNations to the Republic of China on Taiwan. We join the\nrest of our fellow members in proposing a review of this\nissue, with full regard for the change in circumstances since\nthe decision was taken in 1971 which led to the expulsion\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan from our Organization.\nThe problem of drug abuse and trafficking is a\nrelatively new phenomenon among the people of Swaziland,\nbut it is fast becoming a major threat to the development of\nour country, particularly among our youth, who seem to be\nthe easiest target.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland welcomed the special\nsession of the General Assembly on drugs, held in June this\nyear, as a timely and necessary initiative. We therefore\nhave high expectations of the recommendations that\nemerged from the special session, and we commit ourselves\nfully to their implementation. We recognize, though, that\nthe drug trade is cross-border and international in nature,\nand we are working closely with our neighbours and\nregional partners to share ideas and resources in a\ncombined effort to prevent the spread of the drug trade.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland condemns international\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe\nthere can be no justification for the type of outrage that\nwas witnessed recently in Nairobi, Kenya; Dar-es-Salaam,\nTanzania; and Cape Town, South Africa. The deaths of so\nmany innocent people can surely bring no credit to \u2014\nand win no support for \u2014 those who planned and\ncommitted the deeds. Our prayers are offered again for\nthe victims and their families and to all whose lives have\nbeen affected by the evils of terrorism. We support all\nmoves to bring the perpetrators to justice and to prevent\nthe spread of the use of terrorism tactics.\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes\nthe establishment of the International Criminal Court\nfollowing the Rome Conference. We believe it to be well\ntimed and justified, and we are of the view that the\ninternational nature of terrorism and drug-trafficking make\nit essential that they be included as crimes that will fall\nunder the jurisdiction of the Court. We are confident that\nthe General Assembly will give urgent priority to the\nestablishment of the Preparatory Commission so that the\nCourt itself will become operational in the shortest\npossible time.\nThe United Nations remains the only global forum\nin which the world can have any hope of achieving the\ngoals we all strive for. Peace and stability among all\nnations, promotion of sustainable development for all, and\nthe hope of future prosperity and security for all our\npeoples: these are the wishes and expectations of those\nwe represent here.\nOur peoples look to this Organization to create the\nright conditions for these things to be possible. We cannot\nlet them down. I give my assurance that the Kingdom of\nSwaziland will work hard to support the Secretary-\nGeneral and his staff in their efforts to improve the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations\noperations. We are deeply grateful for the assistance\ngiven by the United Nations in support of the initiatives\nwe are undertaking in our country.\nFinally, on behalf of His Majesty the King, Her\nMajesty the Indlovukazi, the Queen Mother, the\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation, I am proud to\ntake this opportunity to reaffirm the Kingdom?s\ncommitment to the ideals and aims of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure at the outset, Sir, to\nextend to Mr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. We are confident that his political\nperspicacity and wide knowledge of international affairs\nwill guarantee the success of the work of this Assembly.\nHis election is an acknowledgement by the international\ncommunity of the active role that his friendly country,\nUruguay, is playing at both the regional and the\ninternational level for the establishment and enhancement\nof cooperation between peoples and the consecration of\nthe universal principles of peace and justice.\nI should also like to extend to his predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, my warmest thanks and\nappreciation for the competence and dedication he\ndemonstrated in discharging his responsibility in order to\nstrengthen the foundations of change and structural reform\nof our international Organization so as to enable it to\nenter the next century with the necessary efficiency and\neffectiveness.\nI also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous and dedicated efforts\nto strengthen and restructure the Organization and for his\neagerness to bolster international peace and security and\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts.\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has been\ncharacterized by fiftieth anniversary celebrations\ncommemorating the creation of many international\ninstitutions, including the United Nations. As the\ninternational community moves towards the twenty-first\ncentury, it is called upon to evaluate its accomplishments\n20\n\n\nin giving effect to the principles and goals of the United\nNations and in delineating the contours of the future with\na view to ensuring security, peace and development for all\nthe peoples of the world.\nIn this regard, ensuring a better world for future\ngenerations \u2014 a world in which security, justice, stability\nand prosperity for all prevail \u2014 remains the highest\ncommon goal, whose achievement requires efforts by all.\nThis requires the international community to show an\nunwavering determination and to sustain efforts to establish\na world order, built by all States, consolidating the\nobjectives and principles of the United Nations and\nfulfilling the spirit and the letter of the Charter, on the basis\nof international legitimacy and the principles of democracy,\nequality and equity among States.\nThe new approach adopted by the international\ncommunity in the process of reform, which covers all\nUnited Nations structures and fields of activity, offers an\nopportunity for consolidating the principle of democracy as\na basis for international relations. In this connection,\nTunisia attaches great importance to strengthening the role\nand prerogatives of the General Assembly in all the areas\nof its competence as provided for in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, particularly with regard to the development\nand maintenance of international peace and security.\nWe wish to emphasize once again the need to\nrevitalize and enhance the role of the General Assembly,\ngiven its universality, representativeness and democratic\ncharacter. Strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of\nthe General Assembly should go hand in hand with the\nreform of the Security Council so as to confirm the\nprinciples of transparency, pluralism and democracy. These\nare values which should prevail in international relations\nand guide the activities of our Organization and its various\nbodies, including the Security Council, in order to enhance\nand develop its role in the maintenance of international\npeace and security, which, in recent years, has become\nincreasingly important.\nJust as we expect the Security Council to act\neffectively and to fulfil its mission in the best way possible,\nwe also stress the need to give that body a globally\nrepresentative character that takes into account the interests\nof developing countries and reflects the reality of the world\nfollowing the end of the cold war by expanding its\nmembership to include all regional groups. In this respect,\nwe stress our support for the request of the Group of\nAfrican States, reaffirmed at the Ouagadougou summit,\nwhich calls for the allocation of two permanent seats to be\noccupied on a rotational basis by States from Africa, with\nthe enjoyment of the same privileges as those of the\ncurrent holders of permanent seats.\nHowever, the process of Security Council reform\nshould not be limited to restructuring that body. The\nrationalization of the Council\u2019s working methods is\nneeded so as to strengthen and consolidate one of the\nCharter\u2019s most important principles, that of compliance\nwith and respect for international legitimacy by all. In this\nconnection, we emphasize the need to review the veto\nright, whose use should be confined to the areas covered\nby Chapter VII of the Charter.\nWe also believe that the sanctions regime practised\nby the Security Council should be reviewed to ensure the\nprotection of populations, prevent their suffering and\nguarantee their right to development and to a life of\ndignity, and take into account the interests of\nneighbouring countries which have economic and\ncommercial relations with the country targeted for\nsanctions. A specified time-frame should also be set up\nfor the implementation and lifting of sanctions. In this\nconnection, we stress the necessity of respecting Iraq\u2019s\nsovereignty and territorial integrity and of implementing\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including\nthose resolutions dealing with Kuwaiti prisoners and\nmissing persons.\nAs we pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his efforts to contain the crisis between Iraq\nand the United Nations Special Commission, we call upon\nhim to increase his efforts and to undertake the required\ninitiative for a comprehensive review of the situation with\na view to finding a solution acceptable to all parties\nwhich would accelerate the lifting of the sanctions\nimposed on the brotherly Iraqi people.\nRegarding the Lockerbie issue, Tunisia has expressed\noptimism over the recent developments, which could\naccelerate the achievement of a just and satisfactory\nsettlement of this issue, taking into account the\nwillingness demonstrated by the brotherly country of\nLibya and other concerned parties to deal in a positive\nmanner with the ideas already put forward. We encourage\nall parties to move ahead in that direction so that the\nembargo imposed on the brotherly Libyan people can be\nlifted.\nWith respect to the Middle East peace process,\nTunisia has since the very beginning supported and\nworked relentlessly for its success. We wish once again\n21\n\n\nto express our deep concern about the present status of the\nprocess. We warned that setbacks and deadlocks would\nresult from Israel\u2019s continued policy of fait accompli and its\nrefusal to honour its commitments and to implement the\nagreements that were concluded.\nWe believe that it will not be possible to reach a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East\nquestion without Israel\u2019s compliance with international\nlegitimacy represented by the relevant United Nations\nresolutions and based on the principles outlined in the\nMadrid process, particularly that of \u201cland for peace\u201d.\nTunisia, which supports the just Palestinian cause,\nwelcomes the resolution adopted by the General Assembly\nat its last session enhancing the status of Palestine as\nobserver at the United Nations. We hope that this step will\nsoon be followed by international recognition of an\nindependent Palestinian State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its\ncapital.\nIncreased efforts by the international community to\nconsolidate democratic relations among States and to\nstrengthen international legitimacy in the conduct of world\naffairs are imperative for the foundation of a balanced\ninternational order that guarantees a better life for future\ngenerations and promotes conditions of stability in the\nsecurity, economic and social dimensions.\nWith regard to security, many regions of the world\ncontinue to be torn by war and conflicts, and their\npopulations still endure suffering and tragedies due to the\nabsence of stability and security. In our view, the best\nsolution to these problems is to pre-empt crises through\npreventive diplomacy so as to eliminate their causes in the\nfastest and most effective way. The international\ncommunity has successfully adopted this right approach and\nhas been able to contain a number of conflicts through\nmediation, good offices and other peaceful means.\nThe United Nations has also achieved considerable\nsuccesses in the context of peacekeeping operations in\nmany parts of the world, enabling it to contain conflicts\neither by interposing itself between the belligerents or by\nsupervising the conclusion of peace agreements or by\nfollowing up on their implementation. In addition, the\nUnited Nations has intensified cooperation with regional\norganizations within the framework of respect for the\nnational sovereignty and political independence of States,\nand non-interference in their internal affairs.\nNevertheless, these efforts remain insufficient, given\nthe challenges that persist in many regions of the world,\nin particular, the African continent. Africa continues to\nface difficulties and diverse problems which are\nincreasing its burden and hindering its efforts to achieve\nstability and development.\nIn this respect, Tunisia has welcomed the Security\nCouncil\u2019s initiative regarding the situation in Africa. We\nbelieve that the Secretary-General\u2019s report in this regard\nwas well timed, expressing concern about the situation\nand offering help to the African continent to find\nsolutions capable of enhancing its security and\ndevelopment.\nWe hope that this orientation will be confirmed by\ncontinued United Nations support for the Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution of the\nOrganization of African Unity through adoption of\npractical measures designed to help the integration of\nAfrican States in the world economy.\nWe believe that a lasting peace can be established\nonly through total dismantling weapons of mass\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, whose\nformidable arsenals constitute a continued threat to\nhumanity. It has become clear that the current nuclear\nnon-proliferation regime cannot by itself eliminate the\ndanger that the arms race poses to humanity with its\nominous implications. Therefore it has become imperative\nthat the international community increase its efforts to\nadopt practical measures aiming at eliminating all\nweapons of mass destruction, without exception, and\nbanning their proliferation and stockpiling.\nWhile working towards that objective, the\ninternational community should strenuously endeavour to\nensure the safety of non-nuclear States and to prohibit the\nuse and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons against\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and peoples of those\nStates. We also emphasize the need for creating nuclear-\nweapon-free zones so as to put an end to continued\nthreats to the security of countries and to open new vistas\nfor the establishment of peace, security and stability\nthroughout the world. In this context, Tunisia calls for the\nurgent creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the\nMiddle East, considering that all the countries of the\nregion except Israel have adhered to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nWith regard to conventional weapons, we express\nour satisfaction at the signing at Ottawa of the\n22\n\n\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction. Tunisia hastened to sign that Convention,\nbelieving that an end should be put to the great suffering\nthat unarmed civilians are enduring because of these\nweapons. Hence, the necessary legal measures are being\ntaken for Tunisia\u2019s ratification of the Convention.\nWe believe that peace and security cannot be\nestablished in the world without achieving economic and\nsocial development and ensuring conditions of well-being\nand dignified living for all peoples.\nMeeting the major challenges confronting developing\ncountries starts with the establishment of a world economic\norder founded on equality and solidarity so as to enable\ndeveloping countries to be integrated in the world economy\nand to attract the required flow of capital and direct\ninvestment needed to support their development efforts.\nThe financial crisis that certain developing countries\nare experiencing confirms our belief that the economic\nglobalization in which we have placed high hopes has,\ndespite its positive aspects, negative repercussions on the\nworld economy, particularly on the stability of the\neconomies of developing countries.\nWe call upon the international community and all\nUnited Nations agencies, in cooperation with the Bretton\nWoods institutions, to speed up taking the necessary\nmeasures that will overcome the negative aspects of\nglobalization. Therefore, we support the search for effective\nmultilateral mechanisms to control international capital\nflows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair\ncompetition and to organize financial transactions on sound\nand solid bases. In this context, my country supports the\ninitiative taken by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries\nto establish a high-level mechanism of consultation between\nthe Movement and the Group of Eight most industrialized\ncountries.\nWe also believe that in the absence of a radical\nsolution to the debt problem, efforts to liberalize the\neconomies of developing countries will remain insufficient.\nIn this regard, I would like to recall the proposal made by\nMr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of\nTunisia, with respect to finding a solution to the problem of\nexternal debt by applying those debts to the implementation\nof environmental, social and other priority projects in\ndeveloping countries.\nWorking for the adjustment of the globalization\nprocess is not, in our opinion, limited to the pivotal role\nplayed by international organizations and financial\ninstitutions. Increasing efforts at the national and regional\nlevels are also needed. In this context, Tunisia has striven\nto make its financial structures more efficient and to\nstrengthen the factors of sustainable development through\nconcentrating on the enhancement of human energies,\nestablishing the state of law and institutions, protecting\nhuman rights and public freedom and strengthening\ndemocracy, which is based on the participation of civil\nsociety with all its components in decision-making.\nAware of the importance of economic and\ngeographic groupings in advancing the economies of\ndeveloping countries, promoting man and facing the\nchallenges of globalization, Tunisia has adopted a\ncomprehensive strategy that reconciles the imperatives of\nsecurity and the requirements of cooperation with\neconomic complementarity and solidarity among States.\nThat strategy is also based on strengthening the Maghreb\narea, establishing partnership with the European Union\nthrough the creation of a free trade zone and\nconsolidating its relations with all countries, particularly\nthose of Africa.\nThe international conferences which have been held\nin recent years, particularly the Vienna World Conference\non Human Rights, the Beijing Conference on Women and\nthe Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development,\nhave enabled the international community to develop\ncoherent plans of action, addressing many social problems\nwhich still hinder the progress, the stability and the\nsecurity of peoples.\nTunisia calls for increased efforts to ensure full\nimplementation and genuine follow-up of the decisions,\nrecommendations and plans of action adopted by those\nconferences and for the necessary measures to apply\nthem.\nWhile we recognize the responsibility of States in\nimplementing economic policies which ensure the right of\ntheir citizens to development, we also emphasize the need\nto establish equitable international economic relations\nwhich take into account the right of all countries,\nparticularly developing countries, to comprehensive and\nsustainable development. We also call upon United\nNations organs, funds, programmes and specialized\nagencies to shoulder their responsibilities and help\ndeveloping countries carry out their economic\nprogrammes.\n23\n\n\nThe continued shrinkage of resources allocated for\nUnited Nations economic and social activities is a matter of\nconcern to us. Therefore, we call again for the\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions stressing\nthe need to provide additional funds for development. We\nalso urge the international community, and particularly rich\ncountries, to honour their commitments so as to give\nimpetus to their efforts in the area of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. This coincides\nwith the start of the evaluation of the follow-up of the\nrecommendations adopted at the Vienna World Conference\non Human Rights. We believe that the international\ncommunity should take this ideal opportunity to reaffirm its\ncommitment to promoting and protecting human rights as\nwell as to develop a clear plan in this regard for the future.\nTunisia takes note with satisfaction of the pioneering\nrole played by the United Nations in promoting human\nrights, a matter which is in the forefront of its priorities, in\naccordance with an approach based on a comprehensive and\ncoherent vision of those rights. Tunisia has contributed to\nthe formulation of that approach. Nevertheless, we feel that\nthese achievements are not enough. Poverty and exclusion\ncontinue to disrupt social stability in many countries. These\nare phenomena which also threaten the gains made in the\nfield of human rights and constitute challenges which\nshould be met with the required efficiency and\neffectiveness. The international community should, in our\nopinion, confirm the values of tolerance and disseminate\nthem as a basic platform for promoting human rights and\ndeepening the culture of human rights among societies\nthroughout the world.\nWe also emphasize that great importance should be\ngiven to the right to development and the need to remove\nall obstacles to the effective exercise of that right.\nIn implementing its social and economic policy,\nTunisia has adopted a comprehensive and integrated\nstrategy aimed at the advancement of human beings. It has\nworked to honour all the commitments it has made by\nadhering to human rights conventions. At the initiative of\nthe President of the Republic, many amendments to enact\nlegislation have been introduced with a view to\nstrengthening democracy and pluralism, promoting and\nsafeguarding human rights, disseminating the culture of\nhuman rights, strengthening national institutions and\nmechanisms working in this field and protecting individual\nand group liberties as well as the rights of women and the\nchild.\nIn the area of social and economic development,\nTunisia has increased its efforts to ensure a dignified life\nfor members of all social sectors. It has focused its policy\nin this field on the enhancement of social integration, the\nstruggle against poverty and the promotion of\nemployment for all. In formulating its policy, Tunisia has\nbeen eager to involve all components of civil society in\ndefining a comprehensive strategy and in taking necessary\nmeasures to carry out programmes of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nSocial solidarity is one of the pillars of Tunisia\u2019s\npolicy in combating poverty and all forms of exclusion.\nThe National Solidarity Fund, set up in 1992 at the\ninitiative of the President of the Republic and\nsubsequently reinforced by the creation of the Tunisian\nSolidarity Bank, has provided funds for many projects for\nlow-income groups and has made possible the integration\nof underprivileged regions into the national economy.\nWith respect to the consolidation of its employment\npolicy, Tunisia recently formulated a comprehensive\nstrategy manifested in the adoption of a national\ndeclaration on employment. That declaration was drafted\nfollowing broad consultations in which all the country\u2019s\nactive forces took part; this was signed by all of our\npolitical parties, trade unions and professional\nassociations.\nTunisia\u2019s approach to the formulation and\nimplementation of its economic and social policy is based\non the conviction that the phenomena of exclusion,\nmarginalization and social discrimination create threats to\nthe very foundations of stability and security, which are\nessential for the progress and prosperity of peoples. The\nstruggle against those phenomena is the most appropriate\nmeans for eradicating terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, organized crime and drug-trafficking.\nIn that connection, we once again urge the\ninternational community to increase its efforts to combat\nterrorism by setting up a global strategy and taking the\nnecessary legal measures to contain and uproot that\nphenomenon.\nIncreased international awareness of the great danger\nof the drug phenomenon, which was illustrated in the\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly\nin June 1998 on the common struggle against drugs,\n24\n\n\nencourages us to support the efforts being made by the\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to\nformulate a draft United Nations framework convention\nagainst organized crime. We hope that these efforts will\nsucceed, for the international community is in urgent need\nof such an instrument.\nIn the same context, Tunisia welcomes the\nrecommendations of the World Conference of Ministers\nResponsible for Youth, held recently in Lisbon, and stresses\nthe need to ensure that the implementation of the decisions\ntaken at that conference is followed up. This will allow us\nto deal with the concerns of young people, develop their\nsense of responsibility and properly prepare them to assume\nthe responsibility of managing tomorrow\u2019s world.\nThe Diplomatic Conference held at Rome in June and\nJuly 1998 on the creation of the International Criminal\nCourt and the extensive participation of Member States and\nnon-governmental organizations in that Conference, testify\nto the great importance we all accord to the creation of\nsuch a court, whose task will be to deal with heinous\ncrimes against humanity and to punish their perpetrators.\nTunisia participated in the Conference and voted in\nfavour of the statute of the Court. While expressing\nsatisfaction at the agreement reached on the creation of\nthe Court, we would like to stress once again the\nimportance of ensuring its independence and neutrality.\nGiven the need to respect the principle of national\nsovereignty, Tunisia supports the consensus reached on\nthe complementary character of the jurisdiction of the\nInternational Criminal Court and on the need to accord\npriority to national legal systems, which should retain the\ninitiative of prosecution.\nWe look forward to the advent of the new century\nwith high hopes, and we call upon all States to evaluate\nwhat we have achieved so as to pursue joint action, to\nconfront remaining challenges and to spare humanity from\nsuffering like that which it has endured throughout the\ncurrent century. This is a task that requires firm political\nwill from all of us in order to meet the aspirations of our\npeoples to security, stability, growth and cooperation.\nOur devotion to the principles and purposes of the\nCharter of the United Nations, the consolidation of\ninternational legality and democratic practice among\nnations, and the implementation of the process of the\nreform of the United Nations system to serve those\nprinciples and goals are undoubtedly the best means by\nwhich to lay the foundations of a better world, a world\nwhich we shall shape and build together for future\ngenerations."

        "file_text": "This year we are\ncelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. In our global community,\nthe issue of human rights is the concern of us all. For this\nreason the Government of Norway welcomes the fact that\nhuman rights are now being given increased priority in\nthe work of the United Nations. Adoption by the General\nAssembly of a declaration on human rights defenders on\nthe International Human Rights Day, on 10 December,\nwould represent proof of our strong commitment in this\nfield.\nHuman rights is basically about human dignity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nabout protecting the individual against oppression and\nexploitation, poverty and injustice, marginalization and\ndegradation. The struggle for civil and political rights and\nfor social, economic and cultural rights must be one and\nthe same struggle. When we address breaches of civil and\npolitical rights, we must also address the issues of\ndevelopment and poverty.\nAs a new millennium is upon us, one of our most\nfundamental challenges is the realization of a humane\nworld. This must be more than a vision. It is a moral\nimperative. All Governments endeavouring to implement\nand promote respect for human rights in their societies\ndeserve our wholehearted support. Democracy,\ntransparency and good governance are essential for\neconomic growth, sustainable development and political\nstability. Governments that continue to disregard basic\n30\n\n\nhuman rights norms deprive their populations not only of\npolitical freedom, but also of improved economic\nconditions.\nThe pursuit of a humane world requires new\napproaches. And new tools. A good example of this\napproach is the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which was\nnegotiated in Oslo. With the ratification by Burkina Faso,\npresently chairing the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), as the fortieth country, the Ottawa process has in\nless than two years produced a binding international legal\ninstrument which will enter into force early next year. This\nhas been made possible by a new diplomacy reaching\nbeyond relations between States to engage individuals and\nnon-governmental organizations.\nOur efforts to rid the world of the scourge of anti-\npersonnel mines must be intensified so that we can reach\nthe objectives set out in the Ottawa process. Norway has\nalready made a commitment of $120 million over a five-\nyear period to mine action programmes, including\nassistance to mine victims. We call on other Governments\nto join in this endeavour. The United Nations has a central\nrole to play in these efforts.\nThe partnership between Governments, international\norganizations and civil society demonstrated throughout the\nOttawa process should be pursued in our new drive to\nrestrict proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In\nrecent years it has become evident that small arms are a\nformidable barrier to ending violent conflicts and\nconsolidating peace, political stability and reconstruction of\nwar-torn societies. We need to intensify and harmonize our\nefforts to combat the illegal trade in and proliferation of\nsuch arms, which account for most casualties in today\u00e2s\nconflicts.\nNorway has committed considerable resources to\nimmediate action to assist populations in war-torn societies.\nWe support demobilization and arms collection programmes\nin a number of countries, and we have raised the question\nof what role United Nations peacekeeping operations could\nplay in these areas. To further strengthen these efforts,\nNorway proposes the establishment of a trust fund to\ncombat the widespread proliferation and illegal use of small\narms, in particular through the collection and destruction of\nsuch weapons at the end of armed conflicts. Norway will\npledge 15 million Norwegian kroner (NKr) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d about $2\nmillion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to the establishment of such a trust fund and\ncalls on other countries to follow suit. We propose that the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) be\ncharged with the management of the fund.\nNorway is gravely concerned by the recent\nunderground nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. I would\nlike to emphasize the crucial importance of both the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) for international efforts to prevent the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and achieve nuclear\ndisarmament. Therefore, Norway urges all countries to\njoin the NPT and the CTBT. We believe the United\nNations should serve as an important forum for\nstrengthened dialogue and exchange of information on\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and that it\nshould contribute to more transparency and confidence in\nthese crucial matters.\nThe current world economic crisis clearly illustrates\nthat we are all part of a single global economy. It also\nillustrates that we are far from fully understanding the\npowerful forces of globalization, and even further from\nbeing able to adequately manage them. The international\nfinancial crisis has led to soaring unemployment,\nplummeting living standards and shattered expectations of\na better life for millions of people.\nWe clearly need a better understanding and better\nmanagement of the global economy. My Government\nshares the serious concern expressed by the recent summit\nmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban. While\nthe process of globalization has led to greater economic\nopportunities for many, a large number of developing\ncountries are being left even further behind in the wake\nof the increasing integration of the world economy.\nAs was pointed out during last week\u00e2s high-level meeting\non globalization and development here at the United\nNations, there is no alternative to multilateral cooperation\nefforts if we are to maximize the positive effects of\nglobalization, while minimizing its negative aspects.\nWhile our planet is shrinking, the income gap\ncontinues to grow \u00e2\u20ac\u201d between as well as within nations.\nAt the same time, we are experiencing a steep reduction\nin official development aid from North to South. It is a\nregrettable fact that the industrialized countries are\nincreasingly distancing themselves from the agreed United\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\nfor development purposes.\n31\n\n\nDeveloped and developing countries alike are accusing\neach other of broken promises and failure to live up to their\ncommitments. What we need is a new partnership based on\nresult-oriented policies in developing countries and a\ncommitment on the part of the developed countries to reach\nthe 0.7 per cent target within an agreed time-frame.\nNorway, which has been well above this target for decades,\nis actively seeking to counter the growing donor fatigue and\nintends to further increase its official development\nassistance in the years ahead.\nMany of our most pressing problems are international\nin nature and global in scope. International crime and\nterrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of\ndisease do not need passports to cross borders. They are\nglobal problems, requiring global solutions.\nAs the world changes, so must the United Nations. We\nhave previously commended the Secretary-General for his\nreform agenda. Much has already been done. It is now up\nto us, the Member States, to promote the reform process\nthroughout the whole United Nations system.\nWe cannot ask the United Nations to do more and\nperform better, while at the same time cutting back on its\nresources. As a very minimum, all Member States must\nhonour their legal commitments and pay their dues in full,\non time and without conditions.\nFor the poorest and most heavily indebted developing\ncountries, the debt problem represents one of the main\nobstacles to development. Urgent action is needed to end\nthe unsustainable debt burden of these countries. Norway\nfor its part will launch a comprehensive national debt relief\nstrategy. The strategy will form the basis for our policy for\nsupporting and strengthening the international debt relief\nschemes. It will also contain additional debt reduction\nmeasures on a bilateral basis which will be applied on top\nof the reductions made under multilateral operations.\nNo investments yield a higher return than investments\nin basic social services \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in primary health and education.\nSince the World Social Summit, Norway has actively\nadvocated the 20/20 principle. This calls for a mutual\ncommitment between developed and developing countries\nto allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance\nand 20 per cent of national budgets, respectively, to basic\nsocial programmes. We encourage all countries to adhere to\nthis target.\nEconomic growth and social development underpin\npolitical stability. But political stability and good\ngovernance are also prerequisites for sustained economic\ndevelopment. While the United Nations should retain its\nvital role in economic, environmental and social affairs,\nthe Organization must also involve itself more extensively\nin conflict prevention, crisis management and peace-\nbuilding efforts. In two weeks\u00e2 time we will be\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. The United Nations has proved\nindispensable for maintaining stability, peace and security\nfor millions of people, for which it was awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize 10 years ago. At this juncture, we\npledge our continued support for the United Nations\npeacekeeping endeavours. The Organization\u00e2s capacity\nmust be further enhanced, not least with regard to rapid\nresponse to armed conflicts.\nIn particular, we wish to honour those who have\ngiven their lives under the United Nations flag. The\nincreasing number of casualties among United Nations\npersonnel on missions abroad has made us more aware of\nthe security situation for United Nations staff. Today, the\nGeneva Conventions go a long way in protecting\nuniformed personnel in combat situations. United Nations\npersonnel working to promote and alleviate the suffering\ncreated by war are not protected in the same way under\ninternational law. It is therefore important to improve the\nsecurity situation of United Nations staff, and we urge\nmore countries to sign and ratify the Convention on the\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\nTo further facilitate the United Nations role in\npreventing conflicts, Norway took the initiative two years\nago to establish a Trust Fund for Preventive Action. This\nfund has made it possible for the United Nations to\nundertake preventive missions and diplomatic initiatives\nit otherwise would not have the resources to carry out.\nSome countries have made contributions to the fund. We\nencourage others to do the same.\nTo enable the Security Council to better fulfil its\nprime task of preventing conflict and securing\ninternational peace, it is important to enhance its\nlegitimacy while not compromising its efficiency. We\nneed to find broad-based solutions which better reflect the\npolitical realities of today.\nConflict prevention, crisis management and peace\nbuilding clearly require a coordinated approach. We must\nsecure a better unity of purpose and integrate United\nNations peace-building efforts with those of other\nstakeholders. Norway will be taking over the\nchairmanship of the Organization for Security and\n32\n\n\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 1999, and we are\ndetermined to further refine the already well established\nworking relationship between the United Nations and the\nOSCE.\nMost armed conflicts of today are taking place within\nStates. Civilians are increasingly affected, and indeed\nsingled out as military targets. In this context, the adoption\nin Rome a few months ago of the statute establishing an\nInternational Criminal Court is truly a historic achievement.\nThe existence of a permanent, global institution of this kind\nwill allow us to address the serious problem of impunity\nand will significantly enhance deterrence of the most\nheinous international crimes. The statute also provides for\ncredible protection against biased, arbitrary and otherwise\nunwarranted prosecutions.\nWe need more, not less, involvement of the United\nNations and regional organizations to prevent underlying\nconflicts from bursting into flames. In Kosovo, we have in\nthe last few months witnessed an alarming deterioration,\nwhere the parties seem determined to resolve the conflict\nby military means. There is an urgent need for a ceasefire,\naccess for international humanitarian organizations to all\nparts of Kosovo and stronger involvement by the\ninternational community, in order to facilitate a negotiated\npolitical solution.\nFive years ago the Oslo Accord was signed in\nWashington, and gave hope for a peaceful future for the\npeople of the Middle East. Although progress has been\nmade, the peace process is today in serious difficulties.\nThere is, however, no alternative to a negotiated settlement.\nThe responsibility for advancing the peace process lies first\nand foremost with the parties themselves. We therefore urge\nthe parties to do their utmost to build confidence and\ncooperation and to refrain from all unilateral measures and\nactions designed to pre-empt the outcome of the final status\nnegotiations.\nAlthough developments in Latin America in general\nhave been positive over the past few years, there are still\nsituations that give cause for concern. Every support should\nbe given to the new Government in Colombia in its efforts\nto end the armed conflict. The international community\nshould also give continued support to the implementation of\nthe peace accords in Guatemala. Consolidating the peace is\nas important as ending the war.\nNorway commends the Secretary-General for his\nreport on security and development in Africa. Recent\ndevelopments are indeed worrying and may threaten the\nstability and future prospects of large parts of the\ncontinent. The African nations themselves have the prime\nresponsibility for ensuring a political climate that is\nconducive to stability and economic growth.\nHowever, the international community must provide\npolitical support and assist in mediation, peacekeeping,\nhumanitarian aid, human rights enhancement,\ndemobilization efforts and institution-building. It is vital\nthat these activities be coordinated and mutually\nsupportive. Here the United Nations must play a leading\nrole, in close cooperation with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and the subregional organizations. We\nfollow with great interest the ongoing work by the\nSecurity Council in this respect, and we look forward to\nthe discussions on the General Assembly\u00e2s follow-up of\nthe Secretary-General\u00e2s report during this session.\nIf we are to meet effectively the many global\nproblems facing us, there is no alternative to concerted\nmultilateral action. We must build a future based on\ninternational law, where solidarity and social\nresponsibility are not confined within national boundaries,\nbut stretch across borders and continents. We, as\nGovernments, must do this in close cooperation with civil\nsociety, with non-governmental organizations. In all this,\nthe United Nations must be at the very centre of our\nmultilateral efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that\nI congratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at this\nsession. This session is particularly significant because we\nare celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It is also important for a\nless uplifting reason: during this session the international\ncommunity is confronted with serious challenges and is\nhard pressed to find collective wisdom to deal with\ndisturbing developments and trends. As you guide us in\nour deliberations on these issues, I wish you well and\nwould like to extend to you the full support of my\ndelegation. I also wish to join the preceding speakers, all\nof whom have justly praised the excellent work done by\nyour predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko.\nOur Secretary-General stated in his address to the\nrecent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement that\n\u201chuman rights are not simply a matter of civil and\npolitical freedom. Genuine freedom of choice\nrequires economic, social and cultural emancipation\ntoo.\u201d\nFrom the very beginning of our development process and\nto ensure such emancipation, Bhutan has been guided by\na philosophy of maintaining a harmonious balance\nbetween material and spiritual prosperity. This we believe\nis the way forward to attaining our goal of gross national\nhappiness.\nI have the pleasure to inform the Assembly that the\nthrone of the Kingdom of Bhutan has always been the\nfountainhead of the many changes in our country which\nhave led to greater empowerment of the people. Just three\nmonths ago our King introduced, through the National\nAssembly, some profound changes in the governance of\nour country. These changes are in addition to the earlier\ninstitutionalization of participatory decision making\nprocesses at the district and grass-roots levels. Upon\ndissolution of the appointed Cabinet, a new Council of\nMinisters has been elected for a specific term by the\nNational Assembly. His Majesty the King has voluntarily\nrelinquished his role as the head of Government and was\nfurther successful in convincing the National Assembly to\nintroduce a mechanism for the removal of a reigning\nmonarch through a periodic vote of confidence. Such\nongoing changes have further strengthened the rule of law\nand have enhanced even further the direct participation of\nthe people in development and governance.\n7\n\n\nAs we stand at the threshold of another millennium of\nhuman civilization, our generation of leaders and policy\nmakers must not fail to grasp the unprecedented\nopportunities. Ours is the past and ours, too, is the future.\nEven as we are engaged in the last defining moments of the\ntwentieth century, we have a decisive role in shaping the\nbeginning of the next thousand years. We cannot undermine\nour own role. Narrow interests and differences must not be\nallowed to deter us from the greater legacy we owe to\nposterity.\nI believe that we should look upon all the challenges\nthat have spiralled in recent years as a last reminder of the\ngrowing vulnerabilities of human society. There is the\nAsian crisis, which now threatens to cause global economic\ncontraction and is already undermining the social and\npolitical stability of some nations. The environment is\nwreaking havoc in many quarters of the world, causing loss\nof life and property in both the richest and the poorest\ncountries. And just as trade, technology and the reality of\ninterdependence force us to abide with each other in a\nworld that is shrinking in space and natural resources, we\nfind ourselves torn apart by bigotry, intolerance and hate.\nTerrorism is on the rise, our children are lured by drugs\nand crime, and even the richest nations among us can ill\nafford the rising cost of growing prison populations. Then,\nthere is the spectre of a nuclear holocaust, which continues\nto haunt us. Unless we look at our future and manage the\ncompelling forces of globalization with a greater sense of\nspirituality and social concern, I fear that the global village\nwill fail to provide much of that elusive state of joy and\ncontentment to which we all aspire.\nTerrorism in all its manifestations is unjustifiable,\nregardless of the cause it seeks to espouse. It must be\ncondemned in the strongest of terms. Those who use terror\nor the threat of terror target innocent people. Their\nobjectives are clear: to foster an environment of fear if their\ngoals are not met. Such heinous crimes against humanity\nmust not go unpunished. The voices of those who live in\nconstant fear of having the most fundamental of human\nrights \u2014 the right to live without fear and the right to life\nitself \u2014 abused and violated can no longer be ignored. The\nconclusion and effective implementation of a\ncomprehensive international convention on terrorism\ntherefore assumes great significance.\nThe recent nuclear tests in South Asia have aroused\nmuch concern. However, we are heartened by the positive\nsteps being taken by the concerned parties to calm the fears\nof the international community. As a small, peace-loving\ncountry, Bhutan has always condemned nuclear armament\nand advocated full and comprehensive elimination of all\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Our\ndelegation urges all participants in the disarmament\nprocesses to undertake a more realistic assessment of the\nprevailing global security arrangement, which, we believe,\nhas the inherent weakness of enticing States to join an\nexclusive club. Unless there is an accelerated process\ntowards complete and comprehensive denuclearization\nbeyond the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) and beyond the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the world must be prepared to\nface the eventuality of a nuclear club that will lose its\nexclusivity.\nActive and not passive interdependence is the\nprimary condition for all human progress in the future. It\nis clear that prosperity in one part of the global village\ncannot be sustained when poverty prevails in the other.\nYet unconscionable levels of disparity continue to grow\nbetween the rich and the poor countries. While one\nsection of human society is burying itself in the waste of\nconspicuous and excessive consumption, the other is\nplagued by hunger and exposure. Against this backdrop,\nit is sad to note that shrinkage of official development\nassistance remains a serious concern. Political will must\nbe generated to reverse this trend and to inject new\nvitality into international cooperation for development in\nthe interest of shared and sustainable prosperity.\nRevitalization and reform of our Organization has\nbeen the singular underlying theme of recent sessions of\nthe General Assembly. We are all agreed on the need for\nmajor changes if the United Nations is to effectively meet\nthe current and emerging challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. As we continue to assess the long-term\nimplications of the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal contained\nin his report, we should bear in mind the needs and\naspirations of small and developing countries, which\ncomprise the overwhelming majority of the United\nNations membership.\nEfforts should also focus on further strengthening of\nthe role and capacity of the Organization in the promotion\nof development. In this regard, we welcome the inter-\nagency collaborative arrangements, which we feel have\nalready led to improved coordination and cost-\neffectiveness of the United Nations development agencies.\nIn so saying, I should like to place on record the deep\ngratitude of the people of Bhutan for the vital role and\n8\n\n\ncontributions of the various United Nations agencies in our\ncountry\u2019s development efforts. These agencies often play a\nlead and coordinating role in such sectors of our national\ndevelopment programmes as health, education and\ninfrastructure. Indeed, it is the face of the United Nations\nas a prime mover of development that the masses in many\nof our countries most appreciate and cherish.\nDifferences in perspective have prevented us from\narriving at a meaningful agreement on substantive issues\nconcerning the reform of the Security Council. Sixty-five\nlengthy meetings held by the Open-ended Working Group\non the question of Security Council expansion and reform\nhave yielded few results, and tangible proposals remain\nelusive.\nMy country firmly supports the position of the Non-\nAligned Movement on this matter, as reiterated in the Final\nDocument of its twelfth Summit meeting, which was\nconvened in South Africa earlier this month. Bhutan is of\nthe view that the current permanent members have an\nobligation to be more responsive to calls for multifaceted\nreforms of the Council. It must be rendered more effective\nand transparent through democratization and the\nenlargement of its membership, both in the permanent and\nnon-permanent categories. New permanent members must\ninclude countries that have the capacity to share greater\ninternational responsibilities and reflect equitable\ngeographical representation. We believe that Japan, whose\napportionment of the United Nations regular budget will\nexceed 20 per cent by the year 2000, and India as a\ndeveloping country which represents one sixth of humanity,\nare two countries that deserve permanent membership in the\nSecurity Council. We remain convinced that the presence\nof developing countries is all the more essential for the\nreason that they form the object of most actions of the\nCouncil.\nBefore I conclude, my delegation wishes to express its\ndeep sadness over the loss of human life and destruction of\nproperty and infrastructure in the aftermath of the worst\never floods in Bangladesh. While the people of Bangladesh\nbattle against this cruel act of nature, the people of Bhutan\nare one with them and have extended to them some\nassistance. As a least developed country, Bangladesh does\nnot have the resources to alleviate the suffering of its\npeople and to put itself on the road to recovery and\nnormalization. We are hopeful that the international\ncommunity will respond promptly and generously to the\nappeal of the Prime Minister and the Government of\nBangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my special pleasure\nto congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, as the honoured\nrepresentative of the Group of Latin American and\nCaribbean States, on his election to preside over the fifty-\nthird session of the General Assembly, and to extend to\nhim the full cooperation of the Barbados delegation. I\nwish also to express our deep appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his effective\nleadership and management of the fifty-second session of\nthe General Assembly \u2014 the reform Assembly.\nThis fifty-third session, which is coming to a close\nat the dawn of the twenty-first century, compels us to\nfocus on the preparedness of the United Nations for the\nchallenges of the new millennium. It could well be a\nhistoric session, if it resolves to equip and re-energize the\nOrganization to seize this great moment.\nThe process of global reform is under way. Barbados\nstrongly supports the proposals of the Secretary-General,\nparticularly those aimed at improving the Organization?s\nefficiency and effectiveness. My delegation is pleased\nwith the encouraging start to this process. We would\ncaution, however, against reforms that are driven unduly\nby staff reduction targets or predetermined by budgetary\nconstraints. To do so could well jeopardize\nimplementation of the very Programmes of Action of the\nglobal conferences \u2014 from Rio to Rome \u2014 which\nconstitute the global priorities endorsed by Member\nStates.\nMeaningful reform also obliges us to come to terms\nwith the financial crisis which has constrained the\nOrganization far too long, injuring its integrity and\nnecessitating the use of creative accounting methods to\nkeep it afloat. Prolonged non-payment of arrears by the\nlargest contributor is not a proud legacy to the United\nNations of the twenty-first century. Let us put this\nOrganization on a sound financial footing through prompt\n29\n\n\nsettlement of arrears, without conditions, consistent with our\nCharter obligations.\nReform of the Security Council is also a key\nimperative if the United Nations is to remain relevant in the\ntwenty-first century. In particular, the Council must better\nreflect the Organization?s current membership, and it must\nconduct its deliberations with greater transparency.\nThe growing threat to global peace and security has\nput the Organization?s capacity to cope under considerable\nstress, underscoring the urgent need to streamline and\nmodernize its peacekeeping machinery. We envisaged that\nthe end of the cold war would usher in a new era of peace\nand stability, but the changed nature of conflict has found\nthe Organization?s traditional machinery ill-equipped and\nthe political will to act severely constrained, even in the\nface of unthinkable crimes against humanity.\nThat is why my delegation hails the successful\noutcome of the recent Conference of Plenipotentiaries held\nin Rome, resulting in the creation of a permanent\nInternational Criminal Court. This landmark Statute is a\nfitting complement to the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year.\nWe are pleased to recall that it was the delegation of\nTrinidad and Tobago that introduced the item on the\ncreation of an international criminal court at the forty-fourth\nsession of the Assembly, in 1989.\nThe post-cold-war world has not become a safer place.\nNew eruptions of strife and the intractability of old conflicts\nhave worsened the fragile political situation in many\ndeveloping countries. Such instability has diverted energies\nand resources from the policy priorities of sustainable\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. Ninety percent of\ntoday?s conflicts take place within countries, not between\ncountries. And the majority of casualties are civilians, not\nsoldiers; thus the heightened international concern with the\nloss of life and disability of thousands of innocent victims\nevery year. Barbados therefore joined 121 States in Ottawa\nlast December in signing the Convention on the Prohibition\nof the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Its entry into\nforce by 1 March 1999 will come not a moment too soon.\nBarbados recognizes the growing danger under which\nUnited Nations peacekeepers carry out their duties and\nlaments the recent loss of life at a number of stations. We\nappeal to all parties to conflicts to respect the neutral role\nof these brave and dedicated servants of peace, and turn to\nreconciliation and compromise; only then will they be able\nto foster the domestic stability that is so critical for\nsustained economic growth and for improving the living\nstandards of their people.\nThe widening scene of strife and instability threatens\nglobal peace and security on a number of fronts. Stalled\nnegotiations between Israel and Palestine have renewed\nour anxiety about the prospects for peace in a region\nweary of conflict. The arm of terrorism has now reached\ncountries hitherto spared from this scourge. International\ntrafficking in illegal drugs and arms \u2014 in particular,\nsmall arms \u2014 poses the most serious threat to democracy\nand society in small States.\nNuclear tests have created new fears about the\nproliferation issue. We will continue to support the goals\nof non-proliferation, leading to the elimination of all\nnuclear weapons.\nBarbados will continue to condemn, in the strongest\nterms, all acts of terrorism. We will work assiduously\nwith regional partners, the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme, and the international\ncommunity to implement the Barbados Programme of\nAction to fight the scourge of drug-trafficking.\nThe lesson of this security situation is clear.\nRemedies are beyond the capacity of individual countries,\neven the most developed. The reality of global\ninterdependence demands a greater commitment to\ncollective security goals and better coordination of actions\nagainst the global security threat.\nI now turn briefly to another dimension of the global\nsecurity problem \u2014 namely, human security. In this\nconnection, let me acknowledge the debt of gratitude\nwhich developing countries owe to the distinguished\nPakistani economist, the late Mahbub ul Haq, my friend\nand colleague. More than any other, he made the human\ncondition central to modern development thinking,\nespecially through his pioneering work in the Human\nDevelopment Report series of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). His intellectual\ncontribution to the debate on sustainable development and\npoverty reduction was substantial. It focused policy\nattention on people, and in particular on the plight of\nmore than one fifth of the world?s population that lives in\nconditions of poverty and hopelessness.\nThis concern with the right to development for all\npeople should be a central component of the discussion\non globalization and liberalization and the impact of these\n30\n\n\nphenomena on developing countries, especially the poorest\ncountries. We believe the United Nations must be the\nconscience of the international community on behalf of the\npoor and vulnerable in this global conversation.\nMy delegation therefore welcomed the recent high-\nlevel dialogue of the General Assembly on the social and\neconomic impact of globalization and interdependence and\ntheir policy implications. We found the discussions\ninstructive. There was broad agreement that the process of\nglobalization has opened new possibilities for faster\neconomic growth and improved living standards through the\nfree flow of capital across borders. However, many\ndeveloping countries have not yet shared in the fruits of this\nprocess. And while the benefits are obvious, the associated\nrisks, though grave, are less evident. Who would have\nenvisaged that the East Asian economies would be engulfed\nby a financial crisis of such a scale, and to such a degree\nof volatility and dislocation as to threaten the very fabric of\ntheir societies and, indeed, the global economy?\nWhile many questions have been raised about the pros\nand cons of unrestricted capital flows which underlie this\ncrisis, and the role of the Bretton Woods institutions in this\nglobal order, reassuring answers are few. Clearly, the crisis\npoints in part to deficiencies in the global architecture and\ngovernance of finance. We discern a world economy so\nradically altered from that of even a decade ago that we are\nobliged to focus on the deficit in our understanding of how\nit works, and on how to design a new structure for its\norderly governance. Since there is as yet no settled\napproach to adjustment policy towards globalization \u2014 in\nparticular, measures to protect the poor and vulnerable\ngroups \u2014 the voice of the United Nations must be raised\nin debate on these critical areas of enquiry.\nSmall island developing States, given their\nvulnerability to both environmental and economic shocks,\nare following with much anxiety these developments in the\nglobal economy. We welcome a number of ongoing studies\non the vulnerability of small island developing States. In\nDecember 1997, an Ad Hoc Expert Group Meeting on\nVulnerability Indices for Small Island Developing States,\nconvened by the United Nations Secretariat, concluded that\nas a group, small island developing countries are more\nvulnerable than other groups of developing countries. More\nrecently, a high-level committee established by the\nSecretary-General of the Commonwealth, and chaired by\nThe Right Honourable Owen Arthur, Prime Minister of\nBarbados, held consultations with key international\nagencies, including the World Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), on the vulnerability of small island developing\nStates, particularly in the current global situation.\nAs if to reinforce this reality, just a few days ago\nhurricane Georges dealt us a brutal reminder, wiping out\nin a matter of hours economic growth which took years\nto accumulate. We lament the heavy loss of life and the\nwidespread destruction of property in a number of our\nsister islands of the Caribbean, as well as in the southern\nUnited States. We join in the appeal for urgent\ninternational assistance.\nBarbados shares with developing countries the\ngrowing concern about the impact of globalization and\nliberalization, given its limited resource base and technical\ncapacity. We recognize that adaptation to this irreversible\nprocess is an imperative, not an option, and that countries\nwill pay a high price for policy of inaction. Barbados is\ntherefore implementing a broad program of social,\neconomic and institutional reform to better manage rapid\nglobal change while deepening its integration into the\nregional economy, especially the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM). The recent conference of heads of\nGovernment, held in Saint Lucia from 30 June to 4 July,\nmarked the silver jubilee of CARICOM, and gave further\nimpetus to the process towards a single market and\neconomy.\nIn response to the increasing policy demands of\nglobalization, CARICOM States have established\ntechnical machinery, under high-level political direction,\nto underpin regional negotiations under way within the\nhemisphere. These negotiations will lead to a Free Trade\nArea of the Americas (FTAA) in 2005. This will be the\nlargest and most differentiated of regional trading blocks.\nWe recognize that technical support will be required on\nan ongoing basis to ensure that small States develop the\ncapacity to negotiate effectively, share equitably in the\nbenefits of trade and secure transition arrangements on\nentry that will minimize economic dislocation.\nAt the wider international level, Barbados was\npleased to host in May 1998 the sixty-seventh session of\nthe Council of Ministers of the African, Caribbean and\nPacific (ACP), as well as the meeting of the twenty-third\njoint ACP-European Union (EU) Council of Ministers.\nThese consultations focused on future ACP-EU relations,\nin particular, the structure of cooperation following the\nexpiration of the Lom\u00e9 Convention in the year 2000.\nFollowing those gatherings, Barbados assumed the\npresidency of the ACP Council of Ministers, which will\n31\n\n\ntoday, 29 September, launch formal negotiations for\nsuccessor arrangements to the Lom\u00e9 Convention. Here\nagain, the participation of CARICOM will be bolstered by\nthe technical work and direction of the regional negotiating\nmechanism. CARICOM States will seek opportunities for\nfruitful cooperation and information-sharing with other ACP\nmembers during the course of these critical negotiations.\nEven a passing reference to ACP-EU relations triggers\nour concern about the long-standing and still unresolved\nissue of banana exports from CARICOM States to the\nEuropean Union. The WTO decision on this matter, if\nimplemented, will have a devastating impact on affected\ncountries? economies and on the livelihood of large sections\nof their populations. Moreover, it would create uncertainty\nabout investment and the overall prospects for development\nin the region. CARICOM States remain deeply seized of\nthis question and hope that a satisfactory solution of this\ngrievance can be reached soon.\nMy delegation looks forward to the special session of\nthe General Assembly in September 1999, at which the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States will be\nreviewed. Within the framework of the Alliance of Small\nIsland States (AOSIS), we will participate actively in the\npreparatory process, including the planned donors?\nconference in February 1999. We believe that conference\nwill provide a useful opportunity to foster support for a\nportfolio of priority projects that will boost implementation\nof this Programme over the next several years.\nWe attach similar importance to the meeting of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development scheduled for\nApril 1999, which will help deepen our preparation for the\nspecial session. That meeting will focus on sustainable\ntourism and oceans, the virtual lifeline of small island\ndeveloping States. It will underline our concern with the\npreservation and sustainable management of our marine\nresources and highlight our anxiety over the use of the\nCaribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and other\nhazardous materials through this fragile marine ecosystem.\nThat is why CARICOM States will seek recognition of the\nCaribbean Sea as a special area in the context of\nsustainable development.\nThe special session will be an important landmark in\nthe implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\nBarbados is proud of this international Programme that\nbears its name. It remains a sound blueprint for policies\nwhich support the sustainable development of small island\ndeveloping States, taking into account their special needs\nand vulnerabilities. We believe that with the continued\ncooperation and support of our international partners we\ncan strengthen the implementation of the Programme of\nAction and consolidate its long-term viability.\nLet me conclude by saying that the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly has before it many\ncritical issues for consideration. My delegation believes,\nhowever, that none has higher priority than renewed\ncommitment to this indispensable Organization and to the\nstrengthening of its capacity to meet the challenges of the\nnew millennium. Small island developing States believe\ndeeply in the United Nations. It has placed their\nvulnerability firmly into the consciousness of the\ninternational community. But more than that, this is the\nonly institution which embodies the goals of peace and\nsecurity, sustainable development, democracy and social\njustice, which define our common humanity.\nBarbados pledges its full commitment and support to\nthis universal mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first of all,\nthrough you, Sir, congratulate the President of the fifty-\nthird session of the General Assembly upon his election. I\nam confident that our important work will be guided in a\nmost productive way. I would also like to thank the former\nPresident, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his relentless work\nand creativity to bring about consensus on the Secretary-\nGeneral?s important reform proposals for the United\nNations.\nBefore proceeding to my statement, I would like to\nreport that this afternoon an important resolution on the\nsituation in Kosovo was adopted by the Security Council.\nThe resolution is a firm response to a stark reality. The\nCouncil spells out what Belgrade must do now towards\nachieving a political situation and to avoid a humanitarian\ndisaster. Their deeds and not their words will determine\nfurther Security Council action. Also, the Kosovo Albanians\nmust act in accordance with the demands in the\nresolution. As a Council member, and now as its\nPresident, Sweden has worked persistently for such a\nclear message to be sent by the Security Council. I trust\nthat it will be heard and understood.\nSweden aligns itself with the statement made\nyesterday by my Austrian colleague, Mr. Wolfgang\nSch\u00fcssel, on behalf of the European Union.\nEconomic turbulence, persistent poverty and\nenvironmental degradation provide a sombre background\nto this session of the General Assembly. So do crises and\nconflicts, terrorism and nuclear test explosions and, of\ncourse, the political and financial realities affecting the\nUnited Nations itself.\nWe receive early warning signals, but early action\nrarely follows. Isolationism and unilateralism could easily\nre-emerge.\nMany are concerned about the difficulties they face\nin meeting the requirements of a globalized international\ncommunity. The positive aspects of globalization \u2014\nintegration and economic progress \u2014 offer the best\nopportunities we have ever known for achieving peace,\ndemocracy and development. When trade, economies and\nfinancial markets do not recognize any borders, politics\nmust be global as well.\nThe United Nations has to continue to reform in\norder to remain relevant. The Swedish Government stands\nfirmly behind the reform efforts of the Secretary-General\nto streamline the Organization, to focus more on its core\nactivities and to introduce a stringent and up-to-date\nmanagement culture.\nMember States cannot shy away from their\nresponsibility for the Organization. United Nations reform\nis not a cost-cutting exercise, but one of rendering the\nOrganization more effective. It cannot be reformed under\nthe threat of political and financial crisis. No Member\nState has the right to set conditions for fulfilling Charter\nobligations. All debtors must pay their assessed\ncontribution in full, on time and without conditions.\nI will speak today of five key areas for global\nresponse, international cooperation and common action.\nFirst, we must strengthen cooperation to eradicate\npoverty. Poverty is not only lack of material resources. It\nis also lack of knowledge and influence over one?s own\n32\n\n\nlife. It is a question of justice. The principle at stake is that\nof equal rights and opportunities for all. A prerequisite for\nsuccess in the fight against poverty is that the poor\nthemselves are involved in a partnership based on common\nethics and mutual trust.\nDemocracy, development and peace are closely linked.\nEmpty stomachs do not provide a sustainable ground for\ndemocracy. Individual human security and the security of\nthe planet must be given as much recognition as the\nsecurity of States.\nPutting an end to poverty is imperative. Large\neconomic inequalities and lack of civic infrastructure create\nfriction between individuals, between groups, between\ncountries. Marginalization spurs violent conflicts. Security\ncannot be seen primarily in a military perspective.\nDevelopment and economic integration play a much greater\nrole in preventing serious conflicts.\nIn an increasingly globalized world the fight against\npoverty is a common interest and a common duty. Only on\nthe basis of solidarity can we create a world which respects\nthe equal rights and value of all its people. It will require\nnot only efforts by poor countries, but also by richer\ncountries.\nTherefore, I regret that only four countries meet the\nUnited Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\nincome. Sweden is proud to be one of them. The seven\nlargest economies on average contribute only 0.19 per cent.\nFree trade still remains to be fully achieved.\nRemaining barriers which prohibit poor countries from\nmaking use of their comparative advantages are counter-\nproductive and must be abolished. The trade policies of\nindustrial countries should also facilitate regional\ncooperation among developing countries.\nThe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\nmust be strengthened, as the debt crisis creates vicious\ncircles for weak economies. The international financial\nsystem has proved to be insufficiently adapted to political\nand social realities.\nSecondly, we must strengthen cooperation to promote\nhuman rights. Societies which respect human rights are\nmore stable and more peaceful. Repression spurs rebellion,\nviolence breeds violence.\nThis year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It has given\nhope to people all over the world. It has inspired human\nrights advocates to expose violations in their own\ncountries. It has encouraged Governments to take action\nto protect and monitor respect for human rights. But\nmuch remains to be done.\nPrimitive expressions of public vengeance have no\nplace in a civilized legal system. Today, a majority of the\nMember States have abolished the death penalty or placed\nit under a moratorium. This is sometimes done in\nresponse to public opinion, but also frequently as a result\nof political leadership and with the support of\ninternational norms and standards.\nEconomic, social and cultural rights create the basis\nfor a sustainable society with strong democratic\nparticipation. The exploitation of children drastically\nillustrates the importance of these rights. A convention on\nchild labour should be agreed at the next international\nlabour conference, and urgent national and international\nmeasures should be taken to combat the most disgusting\nform of exploitation \u2014 child prostitution.\nThe use of child soldiers is another fundamental and\nincreasingly frequent violation of the rights of the child.\nIt is vital to achieve international standards against\ninvolving children under 18 as combatants and to\ncombine this with practical and preventive measures to\nhelp and protect children in need.\nThe rights laid down in the Universal Declaration\napply to all. Special norms for vulnerable groups are\nnecessary to ensure that they can be equal with others.\nThe principle of non-discrimination is of particular and\ncritical importance for individuals who belong to ethnic,\nlinguistic or religious minorities or to indigenous peoples.\nThis principle should be complemented with national\nmechanisms to ensure effective participation in society.\nFew measures would be more important to prevent\nconflicts within and among States.\nThe adoption of the Rome Statute for the\nInternational Criminal Court is a milestone in the struggle\nagainst genocide, crimes against humanity and war\ncrimes. Sweden will become a party, and I urge all States\nto do the same. It is imperative to close the gap of\nimpunity.\nThirdly, we must strengthen cooperation to deepen\ndemocracy. The United Nations should increasingly\nbecome a leader in worldwide efforts to strengthen and\ndeepen democracy. It is essential to develop civil, open\n33\n\n\nand pluralistic societies; to promote equal participation of\nall women and men in political life; and to ensure\nindependent media, freedom of speech and the rule of law.\nI suggest that the time has come to look systematically\nat how the United Nations system as a whole can be even\nmore effectively put to use to promote democracy.\nAlready in 1795 Immanuel Kant stressed the strong\nconnection between peace and democracy:\n\u201cIf the consent of the citizenry is required in order to\ndetermine whether or not there will be a war, it is\nnatural that they consider all its calamities before\ncommitting themselves to so risky a game.\u201d\n(Perpetual Peace)\nDemocracies seek security in cooperation with one\nanother rather than through deterrence \u2014 in openness rather\nthan in secrecy. Democracies also have a proven record in\ndealing with internal tension and strife without resorting to\nviolence.\nStrengthening democracy helps prevent violent\nconflict, by allowing for differing views and interests. A\ndemocratic culture provides the ground for reconciliation.\nThe common values inherent in democracy also\nprovide fertile ground for peaceful cooperation to build\nsociety. The free exchange of ideas, people and goods\ncreates interdependence and common norms. The future\nbecomes a shared opportunity.\nThis is illustrated by developments during the last\ndecade in Sweden?s own neighbourhood, the Baltic region.\nFor half a century, the Baltic was a deep trench separating\nEast and West. The same sea today unifies free countries in\nblossoming trade, political cooperation and people-to-people\ncontacts.\nFourthly, we must strengthen cooperation to bring\nabout disarmament. In May this year, two States \u2014 India\nand Pakistan \u2014 exposed their nuclear ambitions by\nconducting a series of test explosions. These aspirations\nendanger international peace and security, as well as\nstability in the region and international non-proliferation\nand disarmament efforts. This was why Sweden and Japan\ntook the initiative to prepare a Security Council resolution\ndeploring the testing. After a decade of great promise in the\nfield of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the\nspectre of nuclear weapons is again at the centre of\nattention.\nThe possession of nuclear weapons \u2014 by any\nState \u2014 cannot be indefinitely accepted as legitimate. On\n9 June, I and my colleagues from Brazil, Egypt, Ireland,\nMexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and South Africa made\na joint ministerial declaration on nuclear weapons. In the\ndeclaration, we urge the five nuclear-weapon States and\nthe three nuclear-weapon-capable States to clearly commit\nthemselves to eliminating their nuclear weapons and\nnuclear capability and to start work immediately on\npractical steps to this end. We also set out a series of\nmutually reinforcing measures providing a road map to a\nworld free from nuclear weapons.\nAt this session of the General Assembly, the eight\nnations will follow up the declaration with a draft\nresolution. This initiative has already been presented from\nthis rostrum. We invite all Member States to join us in\nsupporting this draft resolution and, inter alia, call for the\naccession by all States to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the entry into force of START\nII and negotiations on START III, the prompt de-alerting\nof nuclear weapons and the withdrawal of non-strategic\nnuclear weapons.\nNew and forceful impetus is urgently needed to\nregain the momentum for nuclear disarmament. It is\nnecessary to counteract the tendency to assign new\nimportance to nuclear weapons. These weapons must\nneither be given increased emphasis in defence planning\nnor be seen as a means to counter threats from other\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThe world needs a new international agenda for\ncomplete nuclear disarmament. We must at the same time\nredouble our efforts to rid the world of all biological and\nchemical weapons.\nThe threat of terrorist use of weapons of mass\ndestruction adds to the urgency of disarmament efforts.\nStrict adherence to international agreements, strengthened\nverification and controlled weapons destruction are\nessential parts of a long-term strategy against terrorism.\nInternational control regimes to limit the transfer of\ntechnology that could be used to produce weapons of\nmass destruction as well as other armaments must be\nfurther developed.\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons is\na serious threat to peace, security and development. Such\n34\n\n\nweapons have been the primary cause of casualties in\nalmost every recent conflict on the United Nations agenda.\nPractical and concrete measures \u2014 such as collection,\nsafe storage and destruction in the context of peacekeeping\noperations \u2014 should be the focus in dealing with small\narms and light weapons. Therefore, the Swedish\nGovernment supports the Mali initiative for a West African\nmoratorium on the production and transfer of such\nweapons.\nI warmly welcome the forthcoming entry into force of\nthe Ottawa Convention. This is a major step in the struggle\nagainst the plague of anti-personnel landmines. Concerted\nefforts will be needed to ensure its full implementation as\nwell as the adherence of the largest military Powers.\nFifthly, we must strengthen cooperation to prevent\narmed conflict. Stable peace does not suddenly turn into\nmilitary conflict. War normally breaks out after a period of\ngradual deterioration. Prevention has the best prospects of\nsuccess at the earliest possible stage of such a process.\nThe need for early action is obvious. Nevertheless,\ndecisions are taken at a late stage \u2014 often too late. There\nare strong forces at work which obstruct early action \u2014\nforces hiding behind arguments about sovereignty, public\nopinion and national interest; forces defining security as\nstability and order, rather than dealing with the underlying\ncauses of conflicts.\nAfter almost two years on the Security Council we are\nmore convinced than ever of the urgent need to build\npolitical commitment for preventive measures and to\ndevelop, hone and refine preventive instruments. It is a\nquestion of political will. It is a matter of allocating\nresources. It is about looking for solutions that are\nsustainable over the long term, even when strong forces\nwant to focus on short-term needs alone.\nNational responsibility for conflict prevention is\nfundamental. International law makes every State\nresponsible for its international behaviour. States should\nalso be expected to account for their internal actions, which\noften have major external consequences. Sovereignty should\nstand for responsibility and accountability.\nConflict prevention is also an international\nresponsibility. The United Nations possesses a wide array\nof instruments for preventive action. Lessons have also\nbeen learned from a wide range of peacekeeping operations.\nA new generation of peacekeeping operations is\nemerging, often with a flexible mix of civilian, military\nand police components. International service is a key task\nfor the Swedish armed forces, and increasingly also for\nthe Swedish police.\nTo be effective, the United Nations \u2014 and, in\nparticular, the Security Council \u2014 must act promptly,\nunitedly and in unison with regional actors. Several\nregional organizations have identified conflict prevention\nand peaceful settlement of disputes as key tasks. The\ngrowing network of European security organizations is\none example, cooperation between African States another.\nCooperation with regional actors is crucial but\ncomplex in today?s growing grey zone of conflicts \u2014\ndomestic in origin but international in impact. They often\ninvolve neighbouring countries as recipients of refugees,\nas weapons suppliers or even as participants. In such\nsituations, the United Nations must be faithful to its\nglobal principles, but must also find a way of engaging\nregional actors in peaceful solutions that guarantee the\nlegitimate security interests of all.\nWhen regional leadership is available, the role of the\nUnited Nations should be one of providing support and,\nwhen international military peace operations are needed,\nauthorizing and monitoring. When regional leadership is\nlacking, the United Nations must be ready to lead.\nI have highlighted five key areas and objectives for\nthe United Nations: the eradication of poverty, the\npromotion of human rights, the deepening of democracy,\nthe achievement of disarmament and the prevention of\narmed conflicts.\nYet the uniqueness and strength of the United\nNations lies not in any single field of activity, but in the\ntotality of them all. Peace, security, democracy, human\nrights, social justice, humanitarian relief, sustainable\ndevelopment and prevention are inseparable.\nIn a time of difficult political and financial\nchallenges for the Organization, it is important that we\nspell out our expectations and priorities. We will have to\nwork hard to allow the United Nations to realize its\npotential. We owe it to the United Nations \u2014 and to each\nother \u2014 to give it the chance to succeed.\n\n\n\n"

I would also like to take this opportunity to\nexpress my deep appreciation and gratitude to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for\nhis successful and distinguished management of the last\nsession.\nI would be remiss if I failed to pay tribute as well to\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor his efforts to promote the authority of this\nOrganization and achieve its noble aims and objectives\nand those of its Charter. I note in particular his report on\nthe work of the Organization, and I emphasize that he\nmay count on the full support and cooperation of my\ndelegation in his efforts to establish peace and security in\nthe world.\nJordan has always believed in the noble aims and\nobjectives of the Charter of the United Nations. We have\nmade every possible effort to maintain international peace\nand security, particularly in the Middle East, a volatile\nregion whose peoples have, for over half a century,\nsuffered from the scourge of war and from conflicts and\ndisturbances and who have lived under difficult\ncircumstances characterized by confrontation and\npolarization. Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty\nKing Hussein Ibn Talal, has always been an oasis of\nsecurity and stability. It has always raised the voice of\nreason and moderation and as a result has had to shoulder\nheavy burdens that have exhausted its natural, financial\nand economic resources and placed an additional strain on\nits development process.\nThroughout the past decades, Jordan has made\ncontinuous efforts to achieve a peaceful and honourable\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It continues to\nstrive towards that goal by upholding the peace treaty\nwhich it reached with Israel within the framework of the\nMadrid Conference, and it continues to support efforts to\nreach an agreement on the Palestinian, Israeli and other\ntracks.\nHowever, the peace process remains deadlocked,\ndespite the efforts to move it forward, including the\ninitiative being made by the United States on the\nPalestinian track. As we recognize the centrality of the\nPalestinian track as regards the peace process, we value\nthe positive stand taken by the Palestinian leadership and\nits sincere desire to reach an agreement that would end\n5\n\n\nthe deadlock on this track and result in the full and clear\nacceptance of this initiative.\nWe therefore demand that the Israeli Government\ndeclare its full acceptance of the United States initiative,\ncarry out its commitment under the agreements and remove\nall obstacles to reaching an agreement on redeployment and\nother outstanding issues. This would make it possible to\nachieve real progress on this track with a view to ending\nthe deadlock, resuming and attaining the objectives of the\npeace process and ensuring the legitimate national rights of\nthe Palestinian people, including the right to establish their\nindependent State on their national territory.\nCiting security considerations as pretexts for\nobstructing actual progress will further undermine the\nsecurity of every party in the region. Security cannot be\nenhanced except through a just and honourable peace, one\nwhich is convincing to the peoples of the region and one\nwhich they can defend.\nThe occupied city of Jerusalem has been the most\nimportant component of the Arab-Israeli conflict throughout\nits various stages. It is part of the Arab territories occupied\nin 1967. Therefore, any consideration that apply to those\nterritories also apply to Jerusalem, in particular Security\nCouncil resolution 242 (1967).\nWe call upon Israel to cease and void all actions that\nwould change the status of the Holy City. Under the Oslo\naccords concluded between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization, it was agreed that the final status\nof the city was to be decided in final status negotiations.\nAny unilateral actions taken before the conclusion of those\nnegotiations would constitute a violation of the Oslo\naccords and of all resolutions of international legitimacy.\nUntil the status of the city is finally decided, it should\nremain open to all adherents of the three divine,\nmonotheistic religions. Jordan has for many years assumed\nresponsibility for maintaining the sanctity of the city of\nJerusalem and has also taken it upon itself, under the\ncircumstances of the occupation, to take care of and\npreserve the Holy Places.\nOn the other hand, Israel should desist from all\nunilateral actions against the Palestinian people, such as\nclosures, sieges, arrests, the demolition of homes, the\nconfiscation of land and the building of settlements in the\noccupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem. Israel\nmust lift the restrictions that hinder the development of the\nPalestinian economy and enable the Palestinian people to\nstart establishing normal economic relations with the\noutside world, free from domination and from economic\ncontrol. It must also deal with the Palestinian people as\nits partners in the peace process, partners who are looking\nforward to living side by side with Israel on the basis of\ngood neighbourliness and equality, not as a people under\noccupation.\nWith regard to negotiations on the other tracks,\nIsrael must prove its seriousness about resuming\nnegotiations with Syria and Lebanon from the point at\nwhich they ended, ensuring its withdrawal from the\nSyrian Arab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967,\nimplementing Security Council resolution 425 (1978) by\nunconditionally withdrawing from southern Lebanon and\nreaching peace agreements with both of them, on the road\ntowards achieving a comprehensive peace in the region.\nFive decades have passed since the tragedy of the\nPalestinian refugees began. The United Nations Relief and\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\n(UNRWA) continues to carry out its duties towards the\nPalestinian refugees \u2014 a recognition by the international\ncommunity of its responsibility with regard to this\ntragedy. However, in recent years UNRWA has been\nsuffering from severe financial crises, which sometimes\nthreaten to suspend or put an end to its services and the\ncompletion of its work. We would therefore like to\nemphasize once again that Jordan attaches the utmost\nimportance to the continuation of UNRWA?s work,\nespecially given the fact that Jordan hosts the largest\nnumber of Palestinian refugees and provides services to\nthem above and beyond the budget of UNRWA.\nJordan has consistently called for UNRWA to\ncontinue its work until the refugee problem is completely\nresolved through the return of refugees to their land and\nhomes and/or their compensation in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). The expiry of the\nfive-year transitional period under the Oslo accords does\nnot mean that UNRWA?s mission is over or that there is\nno longer any need for it to exist. The basic condition for\nthe end of UNRWA?s mission is an agreement on a final\nsolution to the refugee problem and on the full and\ncomplete implementation of that agreement.\nWe understand the continued existence of UNRWA\nand its work from three perspectives: the human, the\npolitical and the legal. To ignore any of them would\nprejudice international responsibility for the tragedy of the\nrefugees, who have been displaced from their homes. We\ntherefore appeal to the donor countries to continue to\nmake contributions to UNRWA, increasing them as much\n6\n\n\nas possible in proportion to the natural increase in the\nnumbers of refugees and the need to satisfy their basic\nhumanitarian needs. We also appeal to all financially able\nStates to provide the necessary financial support to\nUNRWA.\nWe draw your attention to the fact that were UNRWA\nto stop providing services to refugees, this would in itself\nconstitute an additional obstacle to the peace process, in\naddition to destabilizing the region through the frustration\ncaused by increased poverty among the refugees and the\ndeterioration of their economic situation.\nIt is indeed sad that while the world celebrates the\nfiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights we still talk about the\ndeteriorating situation of the Palestinian refugees and their\nhuman basic rights. On this occasion, we are called upon to\nwork for increased commitments to respect and to find an\neffective international mechanism to implement\ninternational instruments relative to human rights, away\nfrom selectivity and double standards. We are also called\nupon to establish a balance between these international\ninstruments, on the one hand, and the national systems and\nlaws in force in various countries of the world, without\nprejudice to the principle of State sovereignty, on the other.\nWe therefore feel that we should recall the appeal made\nfrom this rostrum by His Royal Highness Crown Prince El-\nHassan for the establishment of a new international\nhumanitarian order. In this spirit, my country participated\nand supported the adoption of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court in Rome earlier this year.\nCooperation and coexistence among different religious\nand ethnic groups requires a formula for dialogue among\ncivilizations and religions to replace the concepts of conflict\nand fear of foreigners which has emerged recently.\nDialogue among religions will highlight the common\ndenominators among the different beliefs of the world?s\npeoples and would explain their foundations to the other\nparties, thereby making it easier to understand and to\ncoexist with one another.\nThe desired inter-religious dialogue is the best way to\nconfront the incipient manifestations of animosity and the\nattempts to distort the image of Islam and Muslims,\nwhether those living in their home countries or those who\nhave emigrated to non-Muslim countries. It is necessary to\nhave a deeper understanding of Islam and the Muslims,\naway from the blind bigotry which leads to unfair\ngeneralizations about, and the stereotyping of, over one\nbillion Muslims. From that narrow view, bigotry leads to\nanimosity towards Islam and the Muslims on the basis of\nactions committed by a minority which is farthest\nremoved from Muslims and the tolerant concepts of\nIslam.\nThe question of human rights leads us to mention\nthe continued suffering of the Iraqi people over the past\neight years as a result of economic sanctions. While we\ncall upon the Government of Iraq to fully and\nmeticulously comply with all Security Council resolutions,\nto cooperate fully and constructively with the United\nNations towards that end and to commit itself to\nrepatriating Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons,\nwe call upon the international community to relieve the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. We also emphasize the\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of both\nIraq and Kuwait.\nOther peoples in the region, like the Libyan and\nSudanese peoples, have suffered and continue to suffer\nfrom sanctions. Others who were not targeted by\nsanctions have also suffered from the impact of these\nsanctions. My country, Jordan, was the first to suffer\ntremendous damage to its economy as a result of the\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. Nevertheless, we have not\nonly patiently persevered; we have made our best efforts\nto abide by Security Council resolutions out of respect for\ninternational legitimacy.\nWeapons of mass destruction constitute a dangerous\nsource of tension and instability. The Middle East region\nhas been afflicted with the existence of these weapons.\nPerhaps the ideal solution to dispose of weapons of mass\ndestruction and to end the tension and instability caused\nby their presence is by concluding international treaties\nestablishing zones free from nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction in various regions of the\nworld, including the Middle East.\nWe view with utmost concern nuclear tests carried\nout recently in South-East Asia in the context of an arms\nrace which, if continued, would have extremely dangerous\nconsequences. A majority of the world?s countries have\nfor a long time committed themselves to international\nguarantees that would prevent the proliferation and use of\nnuclear weapons. It is very unfortunate that some would\ndepart from this moral commitment which had previously\nprevented them from falling into the trap of a vain\nnuclear arms race in that region. In this regard, we call\nupon all countries that have not yet done so to accede to\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in\norder to safeguard international peace and security and\n7\n\n\ncontribute to the attainment of the goal of general and\ncomplete disarmament. This would enable humanity to rid\nitself of the terror of nuclear weapons and other weapons\nof mass destruction.\nWe view with particular sensitivity the threat posed by\nweapons of mass destruction. Israel possesses and is\ndeveloping a nuclear-weapons arsenal. The possibility of a\nconfrontation between it and other States that have such\nweapons or other weapons of mass destruction, such as\nchemical and biological weapons, makes us live under the\nthreat of these weapons and the dangers of their use at any\nmoment. Therefore we demand that a regional security\nmechanism be established and that a forum be established\nto discuss this matter in a way that would ensure the\nremoval of this threat. In this context, there is a need to\nestablish conflict-resolution and conflict-prediction centres\nin the region to anticipate such disputes before they occur\nand to prevent them from happening and escalating.\nThe comprehensive concept of security \u2014 a concept\nthat is in conformity with the new developments and\nconcepts that have matured recently, particularly after the\nend of the cold war and the disappearance of the policy of\npolarization \u2014 has become a wide concept that carries\nwithin it all concerns and problems \u2014 economic, social,\npolitical and humanitarian. These problems may lead to the\nmarginalization and frustration of large sectors of society\nthat would in turn sow the seeds of instability and\ndisturbances which lead to the escalation of existing\ndisputes and the creation of new ones. It would also lead to\nthe growth and spread of terror to a disturbing extent.\nJordan has for so long called for the rooting out of the\nscourge of terrorism by eliminating its causes and by\nestablishing justice and political solutions, accepted and\npreserved by peoples. We have also called for confronting\nterrorism with all the firmness needed and for the concerted\nand systematic international action required under the\numbrella of the United Nations, guided by its Charter, to\nfind appropriate and effective mechanisms to combat\nterrorism.\nWe therefore condemn the two terrorist attacks in\nNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. We also condemn most\nstrongly terrorist acts of all kinds and forms wherever they\noriginate. In this context, it is worth noting the ceaseless\nefforts made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\nas emphasized at its Twelfth Summit Conference, held at\nTehran in December 1997, to establish a code of conduct\nthat would unify State views on terrorism and action by\nthese States to combat and eradicate it.\nThe General Assembly is meeting while the world\nwitnesses conflicts and struggles in various regions like\nthe Balkans, Asia and Africa. In Kosovo, massacres are\nstill being committed against innocent civilians despite the\nrecent Security Council resolution on that question. In\nAfghanistan, the Congo and other places, fighting\ncontinues despite international efforts to stop the\nbloodshed and find solutions within the framework of the\nCharter and the principles of international law.\nPeacekeeping operations are among the most\nimportant activities undertaken by our Organization for\nthe promotion of world peace, security and stability.\nJordan has always believed in the noble goals of these\nactivities and for several years has participated in them.\nThe world has made important steps towards the\ndisposal of anti-personnel landmines, which every year\nkill thousands of innocent people and leave thousands\nmore with permanent disabilities, preventing them from\nexercising their natural right to life. In recognition of the\nimportance of the Convention banning anti-personnel\nmines, Jordan has decided to accede to it. Her Majesty\nQueen Noor has sponsored the international effort to rid\nhumanity of this dangerous threat, thereby embodying\nJordan?s belief in the humanitarian dimensions and the\nnoble goals of the Convention.\nDuring the past few years we have witnessed\ndevelopments that have left a deep impact on the world\neconomy, including the transition to a market economy,\nthe removal of economic barriers and the trend towards\na globalized economy. Such developments place burdens\non developing countries and their economies. This\nrequires finding the necessary means to avoid the negative\nimpact of these developments on these countries and to\nhelp them adapt their economies to the changes and\nprepare them to join the World Trade Organization\n(WTO).\nAmong these modalities is a commitment by wealthy\ncountries to increase official development assistance, to\nfind comprehensive solutions to the problem of external\ndebt, to integrate developing countries into the world free-\ntrade system, and to improve terms of trade.\nAs a developing country, Jordan has suffered from\neconomic problems, which grew worse following the Gulf\nwar of the early 1990s. With the help of the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), Jordan has pursued structural\nadjustment policies that have resulted in tangible progress.\nJordan has succeeded in reducing its budget deficit and\n8\n\n\nthe size of its external debt. It has improved its\nmacroeconomic indicators, reformed financial regulations in\nits banking sector and energized the role of the private\nsector. Yet we still face a difficult economic situation\nowing to regional conditions and to the impact on our\neconomy of the crisis in countries of South-East Asia, with\nmany of which we maintain close economic ties. Our\nexports to those countries have been adversely affected by\nthe crisis.\nImproving the economic situation in our region\nrequires the removal of barriers and restrictions that\nobstruct the flow of goods and services among the countries\nof the region, and cooperation among those countries in\nconfronting the economic and environmental challenges\nbefore us. We are all aware that the problems and\nchallenges we are confronting are increasing in scope and\nin complexity; most of them defy individual or immediate\nsolution. We need increased cooperation to deal with them\non the basis of the interdependence and interrelationship of\nevents throughout the world.\nWe live in one world, a world in which distances are\nshrinking and barriers disappearing. For international\ncooperation in the interest of humanity to be sustainable,\nwe must all avoid confrontation and abide by international\nlaw. No State should be above the law. We must therefore\nfoster democracy in the international system; that system\nshould be free of hegemony and inequality. The United\nNations should be viewed as the framework of that\ncooperation; this would build smaller States? confidence in\njustice.\nAs we stand on the threshold of the third millennium,\nwe hope that dialogue among peoples and civilizations will\nbe strengthened. We hope that attitudes and actions will be\ndefined by the fact that what we do today will affect future\ngenerations. Our concern for future generations obliges us\nto create conditions that are better than those of the past.\nWe can do this only with mutual understanding and\ncoexistence, and only with the political will to create a\nbetter world. We are confident that future generations\ndeserve that from us, and we are confident that we can\nprovide it.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, to congratulate you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. Secondly, allow me to express the\nprofound regard and warm ties that unite Argentina and\nUruguay, an ongoing relationship that was already under\nway at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\nWe also extend our appreciation to Ambassador\nUdovenko for the courage, balance and impartiality he\nexhibited during the course of his mandate.\nIn a globalized world, peace and security, economic\nstability and growth are more than ever indissolubly\nlinked. The economic and financial crisis that concerns us\ntoday should boost our commitment to the economic\nreform process which we are carrying out in our region.\nTrade and foreign investment are clearly sources of\nopportunity and incentives to growth and competitiveness.\nBut it is also clear that in recent decades the free\nmovement of capital flows has been one of the main\nengines of economic development for many countries.\n19\n\n\nIn order to dispel its negative effects, globalization\nrequires educational, social and environmental policies that\nbenefit all of society in a balanced and equitable manner.\nWe feel it is damaging to succumb to the temptation of\nimposing restrictions on international trade in order to\nthwart the spread of economic crisis, or to resort to\nhampering or placing conditions on the flow of financial\nresources in order to moderate their volatility.\nIn Latin America, countries such as Argentina have\nmade sustained and coherent efforts to consolidate their\nfinancial situation, contain the budget deficit and provide\nassurances to foreign investment by helping to create a\nsolid economic environment for the region, which is\nincreasingly being seen with new eyes.\nA few days ago, the Presidents of the Rio Group,\nmeeting in Panama, expressed their resolve to continue\nmanaging economic policy mechanisms in a responsible\nmanner that guarantees stability and growth. Accordingly,\nfinancial institutions and those countries with the capacity\nto provide assistance should understand the problems that\nthis critical economic situation presents to countries that\nfind themselves in the eye of the storm and act accordingly.\nThe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)\nis today a model of economic foundations based on\nfreedom and democracy in which cooperation is the very\nessence of the system.\nAs an illustration of the excellent relations in the area\nof security and defense, Argentina pressed for the adoption\nof the Political Declaration of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and\nChile as a Zone of Peace, which was signed at the\nMERCOSUR summit held in Argentina on 24 July 1998.\nThe recent nuclear tests in South Asia constituted a\nstep backwards with regard to regional and global security.\nThese tests delay the economic development and well-being\nof the population. Argentina, together with countries that\nhave renounced the military use of nuclear technology, has\nurged the States of that region to stop conducting tests and\nto adhere to the international instruments in force.\nArgentina, for its part, has offered to share fully its\nexperience in peaceful nuclear cooperation. Allow me to\nrecall that Argentina was the first country that, having\nmastered the nuclear fuel cycle, chose to limit its own use\nof this technology.\nWe feel proud of the steps our country has taken in\nthe last decade related to non-proliferation issues. In the\nnuclear field, we ratified the Treaty for the Prohibition of\nNuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean\n(Treaty of Tlatelolco) in 1994 and the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995, and\nhave become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\nIn the chemical and bacteriological field, we have\npromoted the Joint Declaration on the Complete\nProhibition of Chemical and Biological Weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the\nMendoza Agreement \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of 1991, a commitment originally\nlimited to Argentina, Brazil and Chile, which was later\nextended to most Latin American countries. We have also\nadjusted our domestic legislation strictly to control\nexports related to dual-use chemical, bacteriological and\nmissile-related substances and technologies, in accordance\nwith existing international instruments. Last July, as a\nfollow-up to the Mendoza Agreement, we adopted the\nUshuaia Declaration, which established the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) as an area free of\nweapons of mass destruction. Hence, Argentina has taken\nthe decision to assume greater responsibility in this field.\nIn turn, this decision has allowed us to continue\nexchanges of advanced technology.\nIn relation to conventional weapons, we strongly\nsupport the United Nations Register of Conventional\nArms, to which we regularly provide information. We\nalso support other important initiatives recently adopted\nwithin the framework of the Organization of American\nStates (OAS), such as the Inter-American Convention\nagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in\nFirearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related\nMaterials and Other Appropriate Actions. Small arms\nconstitute another source of international concern. It is\nworth mentioning that regional and international seminars\nhave recently been held in Buenos Aires on this topic.\nWe are not indifferent to the grave scourge of\nantipersonnel mines. In 1995, Argentina established a\nmoratorium on the export of mines and more recently, in\nDecember 1997 at Ottawa, I had the honour to sign, on\nmy country\u00e2s behalf, the Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\nIn our hemisphere we work earnestly and in a spirit\nof compromise to overcome all differences by means of\nnegotiation. As we gradually resolve the few pending\nbilateral disputes, we will definitively consolidate our\nregion as a zone of peace. We trust that in coming\nmonths we shall see important developments in that\nregard. Friendship among peoples is the best guarantee\nagainst conflict.\n20\n\n\nWe are convinced that the United Nations presence in\nHaiti, in keeping with the desire of the Government of that\ncountry, will help to consolidate democracy and contribute\nto the prosperity of the Haitian people.\nThe resurgence of terrorist attacks comes as a harsh\nreminder that no State is immune to terrorism. My country\nfirmly supports the initiatives under way to supplement with\nnew conventions the network of anti-terrorism norms now\nin force, leading to enhanced international cooperation and\nto establishing the obligation of all States to bring to justice\nand punish those responsible for these acts. The Argentine\nGovernment continues to make every effort to clarify the\nacts of terrorism committed against the Israeli embassy and\nthe Argentine Israelite Mutual Association in Buenos Aires.\nLet me highlight the fact that on 2 September 1998 the\nArgentine Republic signed the International Convention for\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Likewise, next\nNovember Argentina will host the second specialized inter-\nAmerican conference on terrorism.\nSevere global humanitarian crises, usually\naccompanied by forced displacement of populations,\nconstitute another issue that affects international peace and\nsecurity. Argentina has joined in the international\ncommunity\u00e2s efforts, with bilateral assistance programmes\nand with such initiatives as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153White Helmets\u00e2\u20ac\u009d initiative.\nIn that context, intergovernmental and non-governmental\norganizations devoting their energies to the solution of this\ntype of crisis deserve our recognition.\nTo grow and develop, peoples need to live in peace.\nWe are dismayed to see that conflicts which could be\novercome, such as those in Cyprus, the Middle East, the\nGreat Lakes region of Africa, Angola and the Balkans,\nparticularly Kosovo, persist in spite of the international\ncommunity\u00e2s efforts to resolve them. The situation of\nrefugees, especially children, who are victims of these\nconflicts is a source of particular concern.\nIn 1998 Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversary\nof its participation in peacekeeping operations. Our\ncontribution has cost the lives of Argentine citizens who\nhelped to make this a more secure and stable world. The\nvast experience acquired over these 40 years has been\nembodied in the Argentine joint training centre for\npeacekeeping operations, and in the Argentine gendarmerie\ntraining centre that specializes in civilian police operations\nabroad.\nArgentina\u00e2s natural interest in the South Atlantic is\nreflected in our participation in the Zone of Peace and\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, which brings together\n24 African and Latin American countries from both\nshores of the Atlantic. I am particularly proud to\nannounce that, on 21 and 22 October, Argentina will be\nthe site of the fifth Ministerial Meeting of the countries\nmembers of the Zone.\nUnfortunately, there remains an important unresolved\nissue in the South Atlantic: the sovereignty dispute\nbetween the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland over the Malvinas\nIslands, a dispute whose existence has been unequivocally\nrecognized in many resolutions of the General Assembly\nand of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard\nto the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting\nof Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as\nwell as in various other international forums. I reiterate,\nwith the same conviction as always, the legitimate and\nwell-founded rights of Argentina in that long-standing\ndispute. And, with the same conviction as always, I urge\nthe United Kingdom to heed the call of the international\ncommunity and observe United Nations resolutions calling\nupon both Governments to resume negotiations on all\naspects of this question.\nThe end of the cold war showed us that far more\ncomplicated problems have been resolved through frank,\nopen dialogue and with a determination to reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. I see no reason why the\nquestion of the Malvinas Islands should be an exception.\nProceeding on firm footing, we have rebuilt our bilateral\nrelationship and, for the benefit of the Argentine and\nBritish peoples, have strengthened political, trade and\ncultural ties. Evidence of this is the visit which President\nCarlos Menem is to make to the United Kingdom in the\nnear future, for which both parties are engaged in\nenthusiastic preparations and which has generated high\nexpectations at all levels.\nSimilarly, we have left behind the misgivings and\nresentments of the past, learning from our mistakes and\ncreating a climate of mutual trust in the South-West\nAtlantic, which is today enabling us to cooperate in the\nconservation of fishery resources and in exploration for\nhydrocarbons. That cooperation renders still more\nincomprehensible today\u00e2s lack of communication between\nthe islands and the mainland. There are few places in the\nworld with such an unnatural situation. It is beyond doubt\nthat restoring direct ties between the mainland and the\n21\n\n\nislands would contribute to resolving the problem. We have\nno doubt about this.\nOnce again, I expressly reiterate Argentina\u00e2s sincere\ndesire to pursue a frank dialogue without preconditions. We\nhope that the British Government understands the full\nmeaning of our offer and that it will respond accordingly.\nTo the islanders I reiterate our unwavering commitment to\nfull and unconditional respect for their way of life, their\nculture and their institutions. Our national constitution so\nprovides, and that is the desire of the Argentine people.\nThere have been concrete advances on vital questions.\nThe creation of a permanent international criminal court is\none such example. Similarly, the recent special session of\nthe General Assembly devoted to the world problem of\ndrugs adopted innovative documents of great importance.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and of the adoption\nof the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\nCrime of Genocide. In these 50 years, the international\ncommunity has become aware of the vital importance of\nhuman rights: today it no longer accepts what was once\ntolerated.\nThe deterioration of the environment, in its various\nforms, is one of the problems urgently requiring concrete\nanswers and effective commitment by governments and\ncivil society. Argentina will have the honour of hosting the\nfourth Conference of the Parties to the Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, from 2 to 13 November of\nthis year.\nWe are convinced that a substantial part of our efforts\nto reform the Organization should be geared to designing a\nmechanism of closer and more effective cooperation with\nthe Bretton Woods institutions.\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council, we\nbelieve that situations born out of the Second World War\ncannot prevail indefinitely. It is necessary to find\ndemocratic solutions that will allow for periodic renewal\nwithin the modalities preferred by each region. The viability\nof this reform will necessarily depend on the degree of\nconsensus reached. There are several aspects to be borne in\nmind. The first is that the reform must be legally valid,\nwhich means not forcing interpretations of the Charter with\nregard to the majorities required by Article 108. Further,\nthe reform must be founded on political legitimacy. Any\nincrease in the number of permanent members should allow\nfor a rotation open to all States of the respective regions.\nThe crisis of our Organization is fundamentally one of\nparticipation. Many small and medium-sized countries\nfeel excluded. Only by allowing greater participation in\nthe Security Council will we be living up to the\ndemocratic ideals of the end of this century.\nThe vitality of democratic ideals in the region was\nconfirmed with the signing on 24 July of the Ushuaia\nprotocol, which reaffirms the democratic clause in the\ncountries of the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR), Bolivia and Chile.\nThe visit by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nto the countries of our region last July was a very\nsignificant event. Argentina had the opportunity to\ndemonstrate its clear commitment to assuming its global\nresponsibilities. The Secretary-General recognized this,\nespecially as regards peacekeeping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We wish you well in our shared\nendeavours in the United Nations and offer you our full\ncooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor for\nhis commitment and contribution, and to commend him\nfor his work throughout the last year.\nI first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Minister\nin 1977. Since then I have for many years had the\nprivilege to attend General Assembly sessions, but\nwithout ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge with\ngratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.\nTo me, this also signifies the consensus on the national\ninterests and the foreign policy of India. When I\naddressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was in many\nways a turning point in the history of India. The Janata\nGovernment was a coalition of many factions, which\nunited in the restoration of our people?s faith in\ndemocracy. Since then we have had many changes of\nGovernment, but the people?s political awareness and\ntheir faith in the institutions which uphold our\nconstitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when\nI come to this rostrum as Prime Minister, I come on\nbehalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated that\ndemocracy can take root in a developing country. I am\nconfident that the Indian experience will prove that\ndemocracy can also provide the basis for stable, long-term\neconomic growth in developing societies. That is the path\nthat the people of India have chosen, and I stand before\nthe Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgent\nIndia.\n16\n\n\nThe world of the 1970s has receded into history. The\nshackling constraints of the cold war are gone. The\ndistinguishing feature of the last two decades has been the\nspread of democracy worldwide. By force of example, we\nhave been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.\nFrom this flows our desire to see the democratization of the\nUnited Nations itself. An international body that does not\nreflect, and change with, changing international realities\nwill inevitably face a credibility deficit. We therefore\nsupport a revitalized and more effective United Nations,\none that is more responsive to the concerns of the vast\nmajority of its Member States and is better equipped to\nmeet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe Security Council does not represent contemporary\nreality; it does not represent democracy in international\nrelations. Following the end of the cold war, it acquired the\nfreedom to act, but experience shows that the Council has\nacted only when it was convenient for its permanent\nmembers. The experience of Somalia does not do credit to\nthe Security Council \u2014 and there are other examples too.\nPeacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulterior\npolitical priorities and perceptions.\nThere is only one cure: to bring in new blood. The\nSecurity Council must be made representative of the\nmembership of the United Nations. Developing countries\nmust be made permanent members. This is a right to which\nthe developing world is entitled. The presence of some\ndeveloping countries as permanent members is inescapable\nif the responsibilities of the Security Council are to be\neffectively discharged, particularly when we see that the\nCouncil acts almost exclusively in the developing world. It\nis only natural that on decisions affecting the developing\nworld, these countries should have a say, on equal terms.\nAlong with other measures, the Security Council too must\nbe reformed, expanding its non-permanent membership so\nthat more developing countries can serve on it. But that\nalone is not enough, because as long as effective power in\nthe Council rests with the permanent membership, the\ninterests of the developing world will not be promoted or\nprotected unless developing countries are made permanent\nmembers on a par with the present permanent members.\nOnly this will make the Council an effective instrument for\nthe international community in dealing with current and\nfuture challenges.\nThe new permanent members must of course have\nthe ability to discharge the responsibilities that come with\npermanent membership. India believes it has that ability,\nand, as we have said before from this rostrum, we are\nprepared to accept the responsibilities of permanent\nmembership, and believe we are qualified for it.\nIt will be a great day when democracy becomes the\nuniversal norm, and when the United Nations reflects that\ndemocracy in its institutions and functioning. However,\nopen democratic societies have one scourge to contend\nwith: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mine\nand other democracies is to maintain our openness,\nsafeguard individual rights, and at the same time give no\nquarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have\nrecounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exacted\nworldwide, taking advantage of the trust that characterizes\nopen societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summit\nalmost two decades back identified terrorism as one of the\nmost serious threats to civilized societies. Events since\nthen, including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishka\naircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and the\nrecent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, have only\nestablished the correctness of that judgement.\nTerrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.\nTerrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is the\nmost vicious among international crimes, and the most\npervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives of\nmen and women in open societies, and to international\npeace and security. In India, we have had to cope with\nterrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country for\nnearly two decades. We have borne this with patience, but\nnone should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush\nthis challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world.\nToday, it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms and\nwith money-laundering. In short, terrorism has gone\nglobal and it can only be defeated by organized\ninternational action.\nLet us make up our minds once and for all: terrorism\nis a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly\nstand scrutiny in an open society, let alone in the eyes of\nthe international community. It should be the primary task\nof all open and pluralist societies to develop collective\nmeans for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting in\nDurban, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called\nfor an international conference in 1999 to develop such a\ncollective response. We earnestly recommend that the\n1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on an\ninternational convention to provide for collective action\n17\n\n\nagainst States and organizations which initiate or aid and\nabet terrorism.\nNow, at the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, there is a growing realization\nthat economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights\nform a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years\nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violations\nof economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead to\nviolations of civil and political rights. In defining its index,\nthe Human Development Report gives a higher weighting\nto economic criteria for developing countries; this weighting\nis reduced for developed countries, highlighting the\nimportance of the right to development for developing\nsocieties. It is therefore a matter of concern that the\nabsolutism that some are seeking to advocate in the\npromotion of human rights is often at the cost of the right\nto development.\nIndia has ratified both the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions in\nour country \u2014 the National Human Rights Commission, a\nfree media and an independent judiciary \u2014 all serve to\nensure that the rights set out in international human rights\nstatutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remain\nconvinced that unless progress is made on economic, social\nand cultural rights, including the right to development, the\nworld will continue to witness international conflict leading\nto migrations, displacement of people and human rights\nabuses.\nIn the closing years of the twentieth century, the\nchallenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the priorities\nfacing the international community. We have successfully\nprohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent\ndecades. The present century has witnessed the\ndevelopment and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. We\nmust ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass\ndestruction is not carried into the next century.\nFor the last half-century, India has consistently\npursued the objectives of international peace, along with\nequal and legitimate security for all through global\ndisarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of\nour national security. India has, over the years, sought to\nenhance its national security by promoting global nuclear\ndisarmament, convinced that a world free of nuclear\nweapons would enhance both global security and India?s\nnational security.\nThe negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate that\nsuch a treaty would contribute effectively to the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the\nprocess of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the\nenhancement of international peace and security. India\nparticipated actively and constructively in the\nnegotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a\ndisarmament framework by proposing its linkage with a\ntime-bound programme for the universal elimination of all\nnuclear weapons.\nIt is a matter of history that India?s proposals were\nnot accepted. The Treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted\nby India on grounds of national security. We made\nexplicit our objection that, despite our stand having been\nmade clear, the Treaty text made India?s signature and\nratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindful\nof its deteriorating security environment, which obliged us\nto stand apart from the CTBT in 1996, India undertook a\nlimited series of five underground tests, conducted on 11\nand 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuring\na credible nuclear deterrent for India?s national security in\nthe foreseeable future.\nThese tests do not signal a dilution of India?s\ncommitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament.\nAccordingly, after concluding this limited testing\nprogramme, India announced a voluntary moratorium on\nfurther underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyed\nour willingness to move towards a de jure formalization\nof that obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has\nalready accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In\n1996, India could not have accepted the obligation, as\nsuch a restraint would have eroded our capability and\ncompromised our national security.\nIndia, having harmonized its national imperatives\nand security obligations and desirous of continuing to\ncooperate with the international community, is now\nengaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range\nof issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring\nthese discussions to a successful conclusion, so that the\nentry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyond\nSeptember 1999. We expect that other countries, as\nindicated in article XIV of the Treaty, will adhere to it\nwithout conditions.\nAfter protracted discussions, the Conference on\nDisarmament in Geneva is now in a position to begin\nnegotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the production\nof fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear\n18\n\n\nexplosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is\na partial step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded\nand enters into force, will not eliminate existing nuclear\narsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations in\ngood faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non-\ndiscriminatory and meets India?s security imperatives. India\nwill pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiatives\nin this area during the course of the negotiations in the\nConference on Disarmament.\nAs a responsible State committed to non-proliferation,\nIndia has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons\nor related know-how to other countries. We have an\neffective system of export controls and shall make it more\nstringent where necessary, including by expanding control\nlists of equipment and technology to make them more\ncontemporary and effective in the context of a nuclear\nIndia. At the same time, as a developing country, we are\nconscious that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful\napplications, and we shall continue to cooperate actively\nwith other countries in this regard, in keeping with our\ninternational responsibilities.\nA few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in\nDurban, India proposed, and the Movement agreed, that an\ninternational conference be held, preferably in 1999, with\nthe objective of arriving at an agreement before the end of\nthis millennium on a phased programme for the complete\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all members\nof the international community, and particularly the other\nnuclear-weapon States, to join in this endeavour. Let us\npledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium\nit will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall\nnever again be subjected to the use or threat of use of\nnuclear weapons.\nThe decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of\nexpectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the\nglobal economic scene. The sense of triumphalism that\nheralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving way\nto caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian\nflu is now spreading to other continents.\nThe hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would\nfoster economic development, with the global financial\nmarkets adjusting the exchange rates, stands falsified. What\nwe have seen is the growth of a large volume of \u201cvirtual\nmoney\u201d that has not been generated by productive\neconomic activity. But the power of the \u201cvirtual money\u201d is\nreal, evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanisms\nare unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement\nin and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run\nfollows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment,\nwith results that are self-reinforcing. In developing\ncountries and in western financial capitals, there is now\na growing acceptance that premature liberalization of\ncapital markets has been a primary cause of the current\ncrisis.\nDoes it mean that the world should turn back from\nglobalization? Our answer is an emphatic \u201cNo\u201d. Rising\neconomic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by the\ntechnological imperative, but we must learn how to\nmanage the change. India has not been affected as\nseverely as some other countries, largely because we\nadopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop in\ncommodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and a\nreduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by\n50 per cent will have a negative impact on growth\neverywhere, including in the developed world.\nI must emphasize that democratically elected\nleadership in an open developing society such as India\nalso faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridled\nfree market system aggravate existing economic and\nsocial disparities. In fact, we need policy instruments to\nreduce disparities, thus creating a more stable\nenvironment in the long term. Such policies are necessary\nin accountable democracies and are in no way\ninconsistent with managed liberalization.\nIt is high time that we begin a new international\ndialogue on the future of a global and interdependent\neconomy. This is a task for the sovereign States\nrepresented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamics\nof an unregulated market place.\nI think I speak for all of us when I say that we are\non the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase,\nbut we are all aware that an exciting new universe is\nwithin our reach. Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton\ndescribed his scientific discoveries as pebbles on the\nbeach, while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It was\nmodest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but\nI believe that we are now actually sailing\nin the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveries\nand will make many more which will move humankind\nforward.\nAnd yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not\nwell. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost all\nparts of the world forces are bubbling under the surface\ntranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and\n19\n\n\nseek to lead the world towards bigotry, violence and\nunhealthy exclusivism.\nIndia has a message \u2014 not a new one, for almost all\nreligions have expressed the thought before. But we have\npreserved the tenets of freedom, equality and tolerance in\nour daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is to\nbe a better place than the world we have seen so far, these\nvalues must prevail. History also shows that these are easier\nto prescribe than to observe. And yet, as we move towards\never closer interdependence, there is no alternative. The\nworld and its leaders must summon the will to rise to the\noccasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is\nthe task before us, and I declare India?s readiness to make\nits full contribution in the testing times ahead.\nI close with an ancient \u201csloka\u201d from the Rig Ved as\ncomposed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest\nlanguage in the world:\n\u201cSvastir manushebhyaha\nOordhvam Jugatu beshajam\nSam no astu dvipathe\nSam Chathusthpate\nOm Shanti, Shanti, Shanti\u201d\nThis means: Let all human beings be blessed with\nprosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of all\ncreatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with all\ntwo-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four-\nlegged creations. Let there be peace, peace, peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "This is my first General\nAssembly as Prime Minister. I was here as Foreign\nMinister, when the waves of change were sweeping away\nthe cold-war era. I recall the optimism shared by many\nabout a more humane and harmonious international system.\nI remember the sounds of joy as freedom, democracy and\nthe market economy rang victorious on a global scale.\nIndeed, significant changes have taken place since\nthen. New States have joined the family of nations. A\nbroader and deeper commitment to contemporary values has\ntaken root. The international climate long dictated by\nideological divisions has withered away. At no time in\nrecent history have nations become so close to each other\naround shared values.\nYet this is not the full story. The late twentieth\ncentury is full of paradoxes and competing currents. For the\nfortunate among us, the world has never offered more \u2014\nbetter education, better health care, greater prosperity. But\nthese fruits are denied to the vast majority of the planet?s\npopulation. The number of people who live in dire poverty\nis growing.\nAdmittedly, our overall security environment has\nimproved. But the resurgence of aggression, extreme\nethnic nationalism, tribalism, religious fundamentalism,\nracism, xenophobia and cultural discrimination pose new\nthreats to international peace and stability. Cultural and\nreligious intolerance is breeding more conflicts than ever\nbefore. International terrorism, openly sponsored by some\nStates, has become a formidable threat to civilized\nsocieties. The interconnected groups that engage in\nterrorism, organized crime and drug-smuggling challenge\nour security and well-being.\nThe threat of nuclear confrontation between the\nsuper-Powers has been eliminated; the danger of the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction still looms\non the horizon.\nThe two contradictory trends in the world \u2014 one\ntowards fragmentation and conflict, the other towards\nglobalization and cooperation \u2014 require a careful and\nsober analysis. This new dialectic defines the framework\nin which we have to operate. The integrity of the nation\nState, and the demands of an even more interdependent\nworld must be harmonized and balanced.\nThe United Nations was our collective response to\nthe challenges of the past. It was built on the ashes of the\nSecond World War. The bitter experiences of that war left\ntheir imprint on the Charter, the rules that govern its work\nand its structure. To its credit, this Organization has\nhelped bring peace, prosperity and hope to millions of\npeople around the globe. Indeed, over a span of 53 years\nthe United Nations has managed very complex\nhumanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to the mass\nmovement of refugees and health epidemics. For millions\nof people around the world, the United Nations is not a\nfaceless institution. It is the difference between peace and\nwar. It is food for those on the borderline of starvation\nand medicine to those on the brink of death. But, above\nall, the United Nations remains our hope for a better,\npeaceful and secure future.\nIn this time of challenge and change, the United\nNations is more important than ever. It is here at the\nUnited Nations that we must fight together against the\nforces of destruction. It is here that we must strive to\nstrengthen democratic institutions, to further promote and\nprotect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and\nto punish those responsible for crimes against humanity.\nIt is here that we must open the door to development\nfor many nations trapped in poverty. Their misery is a\n24\n\n\nchallenge to all of us. But, above all, the United Nations\nmust promote justice so that peace may endure.\nAs we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, it\nis our duty to chart a new course for the United Nations\nand set a common standard for the behaviour of nations.\nI suggest that we should focus greater effort on the\nfollowing areas.\nThe first is preventing conflicts in potential crisis\nareas. I believe there is no shortage of information on a\nbrewing crisis. By the time a crisis is addressed at the\nUnited Nations, it has already taken on critical proportions\nand often reached a point of no return. Bosnia is the most\ntragic example. Regional organizations should play a more\neffective role in defusing tensions from their onset.\nRegional organizations and the United Nations should\nestablish an effective mechanism for coordination and\nconsultation.\nThe second area is peace-building. We must devise a\nnew approach to peace-building to provide lasting security.\nEven when a ceasefire is holding or elections have taken\nplace, the social and institutional grounds appear to be very\nshaky. The United Nations must have both a programme\nand experts to help countries emerge from conflicts.\nThe third area is sustainable development. If the\nUnited Nations is to maintain its credibility for its\nMembers, it must enable people to lift themselves out of\npoverty. There must be more effective coordination between\nUnited Nations aid, international efforts and contributions\nfrom donor countries. Obviously, funding is a major\nconcern, but a coordinated and streamlined strategy is\nequally important.\nThe emphasis recently placed by the United Nations\non the problems of Africa is an encouraging starting point.\nIt should give direction to our efforts to eliminate poverty\nin all regions where we witness human misery.\nThe fourth area is one standard for all. Despite all\nsolemn declarations, international conventions and the legal\nframework, there seems to be no end in sight to\ndiscriminatory practices and double standards. The division\nof the world along religious, ethnic and cultural fault lines\nis an invitation to disaster. We must all ensure that no\nnation in the world feels discriminated against on the\ngrounds of its cultural or religious identity.\nMy final point pertains to the fight against terrorism.\nWe have to eliminate this major threat to our citizens and\nnations. I share the views expressed by President Clinton.\nWe have to place the combat against terrorism at the top\nof our agenda. There must be no excuses, no false\njustifications.\nThe demands on the United Nations have grown\nenormously. We all agree that reform is vital. We support\nthe Secretary-General in his substantive reforms. We\nbelieve that reform must be comprehensive. It must also\ninclude the reform of the Security Council. Piecemeal\nefforts and inadequate measures do not offer a solution.\nThe representative character of the Security Council must\nbe enhanced to meet the expectations of the largest\nsegment of the United Nations membership. The Council\nmust become more responsive and transparent. Reform\nmust render this organ more accountable, effective and\ndemocratic, so that it can exercise authority and offer\nmoral guidance.\nTurkish foreign policy is defined by a blend of our\nhistory, culture and geostrategic location at the crossroads\nof Asia and Europe. It corresponds to the aspirations of\nour people for peace, stability and prosperity. As a secular\ndemocratic country with a predominantly Muslim\npopulation, we combine our national heritage with a\nstrong commitment to modernism.\nOn all the issues and disputes that figure on the\nagenda of the international community, our policies are\nclear and consistent. We oppose aggression and believe\nthat any breach of international law and legitimacy must\nnot be condoned. We have always advocated the\nresolution of disputes through peaceful means and\ndialogue. Turkey has been an active actor in the efforts to\ncontribute to the peaceful settlement of outstanding\ndisputes. We participate extensively in peacekeeping and\npeace enforcement operations.\nWe live in a region where there are major currents\nof instability and conflict. Indeed, almost every major\nissue that consumes the international community \u2014 from\nthe Balkans to the Caucasus, from the Middle East to the\nGulf \u2014 affects our security and well-being. Conscious of\nthese challenges, we have assumed an important role in\ncontributing to the efforts aimed at peacefully resolving\nconflicts and preserving security and stability. We are\nactively promoting regional peace through regional\ncooperation initiatives. Both the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization\nare cases in point.\n25\n\n\nThe Balkan region is a test case with regard to the\nchallenges we face in the post-cold-war era. It is here that\nwe must prove that multicultural and multi-ethnic societies\nhave a chance to live in peace and harmony. We thought\nthat we had all drawn our bitter lessons from the tragedy of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We must never allow it to happen\nagain.\nHowever, the recent violence in Kosovo is similar to\nwhat transpired in Bosnia and Herzegovina; it is of the\nsame making, the result of the same mentality. Within the\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nKosovo must regain its autonomous status in a manner that\nsatisfies all the ethnic groups.\nRegional stability is a prerequisite for international\npeace. That is why we have taken a number of initiatives\nto resolve outstanding problems with some of our\nneighbours. A problem that has preoccupied Turkish-\nBulgarian relations for almost half a century has recently\nbeen resolved successfully in good faith by the two\ncountries. This achievement demonstrates vividly that even\nthe most complex issues can be resolved if there is political\nwill and courage on both sides.\nSeveral interrelated problems, mostly pertaining to the\nAegean and inherited from the past, continue to mar\nTurkish-Greek relations. It is our ardent hope that these\nquestions will be addressed between the two countries\nthrough a meaningful dialogue, without excluding any\nUnited Nations-agreed method of peaceful settlement. We\ncall upon the Government of Greece to dedicate itself to a\ndialogue with Turkey.\nThe question of Cyprus is at a critical juncture. The\ncourse pursued by Greece and the Greek Cypriots poses a\nserious threat to the security of the Turkish Republic of\nNorthern Cyprus and of Turkey. It is also detrimental to\npeace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean.\nOn the military front, the policies of the Greek/Greek\nCypriot camp have heightened tensions on the island. The\nclock is ticking for the deployment of the S-300 missile\nsystem.\nOn the political front, the decision of the European\nUnion to start accession negotiations with the Greek\nCypriot side has altered all the parameters and the\nestablished framework for a settlement. Regrettably, this\nprocess serves only to perpetuate the division of the island.\nTurkey fully supports the initiative tabled at this\ncritical time by President Denktas\u00b8 on 31 August 1998.\nThis proposal of historic importance foresees the\nestablishment of a Cyprus confederation. We believe this\nproposal provides a perspective for a just and lasting\nsettlement. It corresponds to the realities of the island. It\nprotects the vital and legitimate interests of all the parties\nconcerned. It aims at preserving the integrity of the\nisland. It is in line with the United Nations approach to\nreaching a freely negotiated and mutually acceptable\nsettlement to the Cyprus issue.\nWe believe that the proposed confederation can\nfinally open an avenue for peace and reconciliation based\non a common destiny for the two peoples in Cyprus.\nThe impasse in the Middle East peace process and\nthe continuing plight of the Palestinian people are a\nsource of great concern for Turkey. An incomplete peace\nexposes the Middle East to the risks of further instability.\nIt also dims the prospects for the people of the region to\nenjoy an economically and socially sound future.\nTurkey is a friend of the Arab nations. We share a\ncommon history and a rich cultural heritage. We value\nthese strong bonds. Turkey is also a friend of Israel. We\nare, therefore, all the more concerned by the lack of\nprogress in bringing a permanent state of peace and\nstability to the Middle East.\nIn the same vein, we look forward to the\nreintegration into the international community of Iraq,\nwith its territorial integrity intact, through the full\nimplementation of the Security Council resolutions and\nthe lifting of the sanctions.\nThe crisis in Afghanistan also threatens peace and\nstability within the wider context of the region. The\nAfghan conflict can only be overcome through inter-\nAfghan dialogue and the establishment of a broad-based\nGovernment. The United Nations should have a central\nrole in this regard.\nThe overall situation in the Caucasus is a major\ndestabilizing factor. It has a direct bearing on our security\nand well-being. We call for the urgent settlement of the\nNagorny Karabakh dispute and the termination of the\nArmenian occupation of Azeri territory. The Armenian\nleadership must commit itself to the efforts of the Minsk\nGroup of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe. It is our sincere conviction that the interests of\n26\n\n\nthe Armenian people will be better served by focusing on\na peaceful future, rather than militancy.\nPeace and stability in the Caucasus also require the\nresolution of the Georgian/Abkhaz conflict, with full respect\nfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.\nAzerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia are our neighbours,\nwith which we wish to work together for our common\nprosperity and security.\nAt the threshold of a new millennium, our agenda for\nthe twenty-first century must be inspired by the vision of\nthe founding fathers. We must rededicate ourselves to the\npurposes and principles of the Charter. We must fulfil our\npledge to succeeding generations. To this end, we must join\nour forces to maintain international peace and security.\nTurkey, for its part, is prepared to assume its share as\nan actor in the preservation of international peace, security\nand prosperity. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity\nto state from this rostrum that we are a serious contender\nfor the Security Council in the year 2000. Turkey is eager\nto place its assets at the service of regional and global\npeace and stability as a member of the Council.\nThe Charter is a contract among nations to combine\nour efforts to realize the aspirations and goals of the\npeoples of the world. It is high time that we fulfilled its\nterms. It is also time to build on the progress we have made\nfor the cause of peace, security and prosperity of the global\ncommunity. We must now give a new direction to our\nefforts. As the world turns a new leaf, let us rise to the\noccasion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my high honour to address the\nAssembly today, both as the Chairman of the South\nPacific Forum and as the President of the Federated\nStates of Micronesia.\nFirst of all, Mr. President, for the South Pacific\nForum and for my country, I wish to express sincere\ncongratulations on your election to the highest position\none can hold in this body. We are confident that your\nstrong experience and leadership will provide the rudder\nthat is needed here to steer us safely through the many\nchallenges that lie ahead.\nI also thank the President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine, for his skilful guidance throughout the past year\nduring most difficult and troubling times.\nRecognition also must be given to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose tireless and effective\nwork in both leadership and coordinating roles is well\nknown to all of us.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia was honoured to\nhost the twenty-ninth summit of leaders of the South\nPacific Forum in Pohnpei on 24 and 25 August. As a\nresult, I have the privilege and heavy responsibility of\nreporting to this organ the consensus achieved by all 16\nmember countries of the Forum at that summit.\nThe South Pacific Forum is a unique institution\ninvolving independent and self-governing States which\n\n\nshare a very special part of the world. Forum member\ncountries differ greatly in land area, ocean area, population,\nresource endowment, economic development and\nindustrialization, social structures, cultures and living\nstandards. However, we all share a common bond as Forum\nmembers and have established agreed positions on a wide\nrange of issues which transcend our diversity. We have also\nagreed to work together to pursue cohesion, stability and\nwell-being in our countries.\nAt the recent summit, the heads of Government and\nrepresentatives of the 16 member countries reviewed\nprogress and took decisions on a number of issues\nconsidered important to the region, which were generally of\na political, economic or environmental nature. I will\nmention briefly some of the subjects that were discussed\nand refer for further details to the Forum communiqu\u00e9,\nwhich is to be issued as a document of this General\nAssembly.\nThe overall theme of the Forum?s summit this year\nwas \u201cFrom Reform to Growth: The Private Sector and\nInvestment as Keys to Prosperity\u201d. In this regard, the\nForum agreed that efforts should be made to ensure\nmacroeconomic stability by improving fiscal discipline,\nfurther promoting public sector reforms and broadening the\ntax base. It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide\nrange of policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms\nwhich provide the private sector with a more favourable\nand competitive business environment.\nLeaders noted that good overall progress has been\nmade in the implementation of the Forum Economic Action\nPlan, which aims at strengthening the economies of the\nisland countries. This progress was made despite such\ndifficulties as capacity constraints facing some members,\nthe backdrop of region-specific difficulties, notably drought\nand other disasters, and the problems faced by member\ncountries on account of the Asian economic crisis. Specific\nrecommendations were endorsed concerning the region?s\nresponse to undesirable economic activities, the promotion\nof competitive telecommunications markets, the\ndevelopment of information infrastructure and work related\nto the Forum Free Trade Area.\nOn a related matter, the Forum revisited the objective\nof having the United Nations adopt a vulnerability index,\nwith the aim of having such an index included among the\ncriteria for determining least developed country status and\ndeciding eligibility for concessional aid and trade treatment.\nIt was noted with pleasure that the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Council had agreed to defer\nconsideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from least\ndeveloped country status for one year, pending further\nconsideration of the vulnerability index issue, and that the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nhave created a task force on the subject. While these steps\nhave been important, much work remains ahead to gain\nfull international recognition of vulnerability in its various\nmanifestations as obstacles to the sustainable development\nof small island developing States.\nThe Forum solidly reaffirmed its previous\nendorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action for\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates as a comprehensive framework with great potential\nfor the region, and noted the efforts under way for its\nimplementation, but that much remains unaddressed. It is\nbelieved that the special session of the General Assembly\nin 1999 to review the Plan of Action will represent an\nimportant opportunity for the region. Support was\nexpressed for national, regional and transregional\nactivities in the run-up to the special session, both to\nbetter position ourselves for effective participation and to\nraise pre-sessional awareness of the situation of small\nisland developing States.\nOne issue that received a great deal of attention at\nthis year?s Forum summit was that of global climate\nchange, and in particular the risk of sea level rise brought\non or hastened by human activities affecting the\natmosphere. The Forum?s membership includes two annex\nI parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change. All the rest, including several which are\nnot United Nations Members, are small island developing\ncountries and committed members of the Alliance of\nSmall Island States (AOSIS). We are driven in that regard\nby deep concerns about our very survival.\nIt was encouraging and perhaps indicative to others\nthat despite a wide diversity of interests on this issue the\nForum succeeded in reaching a comprehensive position.\nThe Forum recognized the legally binding commitments\nagreed to in the Kyoto Protocol as a significant first step\nforward on the path of ensuring effective global action to\ncombat climate change. The Forum encouraged all\ncountries to sign the Kyoto Protocol and to work towards\nits earliest possible ratification. In particular, noting that\nthe Framework Convention obliges developed country\nparties to take the lead in combating climate change and\nthe adverse effects thereof, the Forum stressed the\nimportance of implementing measures to ensure early\nprogress towards meeting the commitments in the Kyoto\nProtocol. This applies particularly to the United States,\n2\n\n\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation, Japan, Canada\nand other annex I emitters.\nThe Forum called for substantial progress at the\nupcoming fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to\nthe Framework Convention in Buenos Aires in establishing\nthe rules for international implementation mechanisms \u2014\nparticularly emissions trading, the clean development\nmechanism and joint implementation \u2014 to ensure that these\nmechanisms assist the effectiveness of greenhouse-gas\nreduction efforts.\nIt was also noted that an effective global response to\nthe problem of climate change will require ongoing active\ncooperation and strengthened action by all parties, taking\naccount of their common but differentiated responsibilities\nand their respective capabilities. The Forum stressed the\nurgent need to initiate a process to develop procedures and\nfuture time-frames for wider global participation in\nemissions limitation and reduction in which significant\ndeveloping country emitters would enter into commitments\nwhich reflect their individual national circumstances and\ndevelopment needs. But remember, developed countries\nmust take the lead.\nThe Forum noted with relief and gratitude the\nrecognition in the Kyoto Protocol of the importance of the\nadaption needs of small island States. The leaders called for\nadequate resources to be generated through the\nimplementation mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and the\nGlobal Environment Facility for the full range of adaption\nmeasures. The Forum countries anticipate maximizing the\nbenefits to them from such implementation measures and\nmechanisms through the work of another regional\norganization, the South Pacific Regional Environment\nProgramme.\nRespectful of the wide range of reactions and emotions\nsurrounding the outcome of Kyoto, and recognizing also the\ndifficult challenges that will face the delegates at Buenos\nAires, it is suggested that the Forum consensus should be\ntaken as a harbinger of the possibilities for finding common\nground on a larger playing field \u2014 one on which the\nultimate fate of all of us may be decided.\nBefore I leave the subject of climate change, I would\nlike to express gratitude to the donor nations that responded\nrecently to the suffering visited upon Pacific island peoples\nby the climatic phenomenon of El Ni\u00f1o. Whether or not\nscientists can decide conclusively that the recent intensity\nof the El Ni\u00f1o effect is a symptom of global climate\nchange, it is a fact that entire island populations found\nthemselves in a situation where their very survival\ndepended on the willingness of other countries to provide\nemergency assistance. We will always be thankful that\nsuch assistance was forthcoming.\nWhile we express our appreciation, we are also\nmindful of the situation of the devastation that has been\ncreated by Hurricane Georges in the southern United\nStates, and we are hoping and praying that this\nphenomenon will pass, giving relief to the people.\nAnother issue of immediate and continuing\nenvironmental concern to our Forum region is the\nongoing practice by industrialized Powers of shipping\nradioactive wastes back and forth through our economic\nzones in the advancement of their own national interests\nand priorities, irrespective of our strenuous and continuing\nprotests. The Forum noted that some strides have been\nmade in exchanging information on these shipments, but\nthe risks remain. At the very minimum, we continue to\nseek a strong regime of prior notification to and\nconsultation with coastal States on planned shipments of\nhazardous wastes, and the development of a regime to\ncompensate the region for actual economic losses caused\nto tourism, fisheries and other affected industries in the\narea.\nThe Forum leaders could not help but note with\nalarm the recent tests of nuclear devices by India and\nPakistan. They expressed grave concern that the recent\nnuclear tests constitute a threat to the international process\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. It will be recalled that the region encompassed by\nthe Forum members has perhaps greater standing than any\nother region in the world to express alarm over the\ncontinued testing of nuclear devices. The Forum members\nhave endured and continue to endure the human suffering\nthat has resulted from the curse of nuclear proliferation\nand testing. The Pacific island countries are taking action\nwithin the region to counter the presence of nuclear\nweapons and the testing of nuclear devices through the\nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. We call upon the\nUnited States to ratify that Treaty.\nFinally, as regards the South Pacific Forum \u2014 and\nI stress that I do not mention here every issue that was\ndiscussed or covered in the communiqu\u00e9 \u2014 I want to\nrelate the Forum?s pleasure in drawing attention to the\nsigning of the Noumea Accord between the Government\nof France and the concerned parties in New Caledonia.\nThis Accord represents a tremendous accomplishment by\n3\n\n\nall involved in moving forward the process of self-\ndetermination for New Caledonia, whatever the ultimate\noutcome of that process might be.\nI have already consumed much of my time in\ncommenting on issues that concern the South Pacific Forum\nas a group. Briefly now, I ask that you focus your attention\non the situation of my small island developing country.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is approaching the\nend of the millennium with a sense of unsettlement. We\nwill be among the first to celebrate the beginning of the\nnew epoch, but, in an immediate sense, what does this\ncelebration promise for us? Our developmental process\nbegan only a few years ago, and the barriers we face in\nterms of need for technology and manpower development,\nscarcity of resources, our remote location and small\npopulation \u2014 to name only a few \u2014 are beyond our\ncapability to overcome alone.\nWe are indeed fortunate to be receiving substantial\nassistance from the United States and other bilateral\npartners, but our long-term future cannot and should not\ndepend upon bilateral assistance. Perhaps it is not realistic\nfor us to plan for complete self-sufficiency, but we do want\nto become, and we must become, more self-reliant.\nWe in the Federated States of Micronesia have some\nconcerns that the emphasis of effort in the United Nations\nis being somewhat drawn away from the balance between\naddressing the overall interests of all countries and at the\nsame time particularly assisting developing countries to\nmove towards their rightful condition. In other words, we\nfear that the traditional role of the Organization in assisting\nless advanced countries with their development could be\nmarginalized. I use the phrase \u201cdrawn away\u201d because the\nshift to which I refer would not be something that leaders\nsat down and purposefully decided on. In large part, given\nthe breadth of the Charter, the United Nations is simply in\ndanger of becoming overwhelmed by its responsibilities. As\nregional and national conflicts proliferate, drug trafficking\nflourishes, terrorism looms as an ever more dangerous part\nof our daily lives, and as the global environment becomes\nincreasingly threatened, the demands on the time and\nresources of this body and its Members to confront\nimmediate problems are compelling.\nBut while the need to move towards a closer parity\nbetween the living standards of the North and the South\nnecessitates long-term solutions, it cannot be forgotten that\nin the long term the accomplishment of that goal will do\nmuch to address the problems to which I have just\nreferred, which seem beyond the reach of immediate solutions.\nMeanwhile, as developing countries, we too must do\nour part. We must create the flexible, though outward-\noriented, economies that can maximize the benefits of the\nglobal economy in which we also exist. At the same time,\nwe must not forget that our national identities and unique\nnational and subnational social, political and economic\nsituations demand a proactive approach that avoids\nblindly jumping on the bandwagon of the latest\ndevelopment initiatives in order to reap the perceived\nbenefits of donor assistance. In realizing that mistakes\ninevitably are made and opportunities lost, we must not\nlose our sense of self-confidence or permit ourselves to\nbecome overly prone to accepting the dictates of well-\nmeaning donor partners whose understanding of our\nsituation may not be complete.\nBut we must also remain very alert to the need for\ncourse correction and we must endure periods of\nstructural, institutional and even behavioural change. The\nprocess is now ongoing in my country. With the\nassistance of the Asian Development Bank and donor\npartners, we are well along in implementing a two-\npronged programme that involves Government and public\nenterprise reforms, on the one hand, and private sector\nreforms, on the other. On the Government side, we are\nreorganizing and downsizing our institutions and\nimproving our tax structure in order to move along the\nadjustment path to sustainable finances and rational\nservice levels. On the private sector side, our reforms are\ndesigned to improve the economic environment for\nprivate sector growth, especially in those productive\nactivities that earn dollars from abroad. This means,\namong other things, reducing the role of Government in\nproductive activities and restructuring our legal and\nregulatory environment to encourage private sector\nactivity and investment, especially foreign investment.\nDespite our determination to carry through this\neffort, we know that it alone will not produce\ndevelopment. It will facilitate development and make our\napplication of development assistance far more effective.\nBut now, perhaps more than ever, we will require the\npatience, understanding and continued support of donor\npartners and international institutions, which have been so\ninstrumental in helping us to reach this point.\nThis is to be a session during which two very\nimportant anniversaries are celebrated: 50 years of United\nNations peacekeeping and 50 years of the Universal\n4\n\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights. As to the first, I wish to\nhonour those who served in the peacekeeping operations of\nthe past 50 years, especially those who lost their lives in\nthe service of the United Nations. As to the second, the\nvital role played by the Declaration hardly needs my\nendorsement; but I would refer to my statement at the 1993\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, when, in\nspeaking with respect to those who have given their lives\nin the cause of human rights, I said:\n\u201cThose very heroes would be among the first to say,\n'Let?s look into the past only for what we can learn\nfrom it. The job is not yet done, and our enemy grows\nstronger.'\u201d\nIt only remains for me to refer to the activities of the\ninternational community and this body having to do with\nmy country?s predominant resource \u2014 the ocean. This is\nthe International Year of the Ocean. The world can little\nafford to miss the opportunities presented by this occasion\nto focus on our planet?s most prevalent yet least understood\nphysical mechanism. The single best example of that\ndangerously incomplete understanding surely is the ocean-\ngenerated, worldwide disaster of El Ni\u00f1o, which occurred,\nironically, this year.\nFor obvious reasons, the peoples of Micronesia\nsecured involvement in the long negotiations that led to the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea even\nbefore we emerged from Trusteeship status. We have\ncontinued that involvement as a party to the Convention\nand now call on all States to ratify the Convention and\nparticipate fully in the process. We support the Tribunal for\nthe Law of the Sea, as well as resolutions aimed at\neradicating the practice of driftnet fishing and unauthorized\nfishing in areas of national jurisdiction. We urge action to\nreduce by-catches, fish discards and post-harvest losses.\nLooking towards the Assembly?s special session on the\nBarbados Programme of Action, and also towards next\nyear?s consideration of oceans by the Commission on\nSustainable Development, we encourage the recognition of\nlinkages between the various related issues and the need for\nmore integrated treatment. By necessity, I speak of linkages\nand integration, which are familiar terms of usage within\nthe United Nations system but there is nothing routine\nabout the devastations of El Ni\u00f1o that were visited upon my\ncountry?s people earlier this year and upon other peoples\naround the world. I can think of no better example of the\nneed for the recognition of linkages in terms of ocean and\nclimatic issues and the necessity for the application of\nintegrated response measures.\nIn closing, I should like to refer to the fact that, in\nrecent years, as the problems of our increasingly complex\nand globalized society appear to have escalated, it has\nbecome fashionable in some quarters to question whether\nthe United Nations Organization is worth maintaining. It\nis as though the world?s peoples expect that the worth of\nthis Organization is to be tested by its efficiency in\n\u201cfixing\u201d a set of global problems, after which,\npresumably, we would all live happily ever after. That\nmistaken notion is grounded in the assumption that\ninternational cooperation exists only for immediate\nproblem-solving.\nSpeaking for a relatively new Member country of the\nUnited Nations, allow me to suggest humbly that the\nrepetition of mistakes of whatever scale and the creation\nof new crises along with every step forward is elemental\nto the human condition. The Charter of this Organization,\nmonumental as it may be, is still a document designed by\nand for human beings on this planet and must be judged\nand applied in light of the human experience. The United\nNations should not be expected to work itself out of a\njob.\nThe people and the Government of the Federated\nStates of Micronesia deeply respect the past\naccomplishments of the United Nations and look forward\nto continuing to meet our commitments to it, even though\nour contributions may appear small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The Dominican Republic wishes to express\nits gratitude for the gestures of solidarity expressed by\nfriendly countries with regard to the passage of the terrible\nhurricane, Georges, which struck our country yesterday.\nFurthermore, we appeal to the generosity of the\ninternational community to provide cooperation with a view\nto facing both the immediate emergencies of the population\naffected by this phenomenon and the process of national\nrecovery.\nThe delegation of the Dominican Republic, on behalf\nof the Government presided over by Mr. Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez,\nwishes to extend its warmest congratulations to the\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Uruguay, on his well-deserved election to preside\nover the fifty-third session, which is taking place at a time\nof great structural changes in global society and within our\nOrganization. We also wish to thank Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, who presided over the deliberations of the last\nsession of the General Assembly with such skill. Our\ngratitude goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his devotion and efforts to guide the\nOrganization along the path towards modernization and\nreform, which will strengthen us as we reach the new\nmillennium.\nThe changes in the realities of the world in which\nwe live make it necessary to revise international policy.\nIn this respect, the United Nations, being the universal\nforum, must be strengthened and renewed by increasing\nits activities in areas such as peace and security of\nnations, the protection of human rights and the\nenvironment and cooperation for socio-economic and\ncultural development.\nFaithful to its principles, the United Nations must\ncontinue to encourage and deepen its programme of\nreforms, taking into consideration not only the complexity\nof the current reality, but also the future development of\nregulations aimed at relieving social marginalization and\nethnic and religious tensions, which jeopardize the priority\nobjectives of peace and development for our peoples. The\nDominican Republic expresses its firm support for the\nnegotiations and consultations on the programme of\nreform. We trust that the process will culminate in\nsubstantial changes in the various organs of the United\nNations, enhancing their effectiveness and leading to a\nmore democratic, transparent and representative\nOrganization, thus ensuring its ability to act to achieve its\npresent objectives.\nFortunately, the constant threat of a nuclear war has\ndiminished. Today, however, we are faced with the\nchallenge of combating together, and on a global scale,\nhunger, poverty, environmental destruction and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and\nencourage equitable development and free societies. We\nmust also struggle to lay the bases of economic growth.\nThere are other security problems that require\ndecisive action: international terrorism, organized crime\nand illicit trafficking in arms and drugs. We must create\nreliable instruments to put an end to these evils and\nachieve acceptable levels of security for our citizens so\nthat they can live in peace. The politics of security is\ninspired by the vision of a democratic world that practices\nsolidarity. Security must be achieved on the basis of\npolitical, economic, social and ecological cooperation. The\nprinciple of sovereign equality of States and the belief\nthat conflicts of interest must be resolved peacefully\nrequire global cooperation because security can be\nachieved only with the participation of all States.\n41\n\n\nThat task falls principally to the Security Council. The\nDominican Republic believes it necessary to enlarge the\nCouncil by creating new seats for the regions of Latin\nAmerica, Asia and Africa, thus strengthening it in the\nfulfilment of its functions and allowing for greater\nrepresentativity.\nThe Dominican Republic believes that international\npeace and stability are prerequisites for a secure future for\nmankind. Democracy and respect for human rights, together\nwith justice and respect for the law, are the surest ways of\npreserving peace. General acceptance of these principles\ncannot be imposed, but it can be actively promoted.\nThe crisis spots that afflict large segments of the\nworld?s population continue to be of concern to many\nStates. We emphasize the need to strengthen mechanisms\nof dialogue and negotiation in conflict areas such as the\nBalkans, the Middle East and the Great Lakes region in\nAfrica. With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan,\nthe Dominican Republic reiterates the positions presented\nby its President, Mr. Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, with regard to the\nneed for the international community to consider the\nimportance of that country, due to its geographic location,\nfor the peace, security and prosperity of that region. We\nfavour constructive dialogue between both sides of the\nTaiwan Strait to bring about understanding and mutual\ncooperation. We reiterate that the parallel participation of\nboth countries in the United Nations would be conducive to\nthe maintenance of peace.\nThe Dominican Republic is also committed to the\nprocess of nuclear disarmament and vigorously protests the\nrecent nuclear tests, as these can endanger world peace. We\nreaffirm the need for strict respect for international treaties\non the prohibition, emplacement and testing of nuclear\nweapons, in the atmosphere, in the oceanic subsoil and on\nthe ocean floor. We urge nuclear-weapon States to use and\nhandle those weapons responsibly as the only protection for\nthose of us who do not have that type of defence. The\npreservation of world peace demands that Member States\nof the United Nations establish new nuclear-weapon-free\nzones and protect those already existing as a guarantee of\nsecurity.\nConcern for the preservation of a zone free of nuclear\ncontamination is shared by the nations of the Caribbean,\nwhich is used as a transportation route for toxic and nuclear\nwastes. For those countries among us that depend largely\non tourism based on sun and beaches, the coastal water\nquality is vital to that important sector of our economies.\nOngoing trafficking in illicit arms represents another\nthreat to security. The arms build-up must definitively be\nstopped. The relevant international conventions signed by\nthe Dominican Republic are very important, such as the\none on illicit trafficking in conventional weapons.\nPeaceful settlement of conflicts by means of\ndialogue and accord is the best method to eliminate the\nuse of force in political relations within and among\nMember countries. For that reason, it is necessary to\nenhance the efforts and mechanisms recognized by\ninternational law in order to resolve international\nconflicts. In that context, the Dominican Republic accepts\nand defends multilateralism as the appropriate way of\nachieving consensus on the main problems that afflict the\nworld population. Poverty, drug-trafficking, terrorism,\ninter-ethnic and territorial conflicts are problems that must\nnot be dealt with unilaterally.\nFor that reason we support the strengthening of\nestablished international systems of justice. The signing\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court is\nurgently needed to achieve these ends. We believe that\nthe instruments to protect peace must be used before\nconflicts occur. The United Nations must take preventive\naction and respond rapidly and effectively to avoid later\nconsequences. In that respect, the Convention on the\nelimination of anti-personnel landmines, signed by many\nMember States of the United Nations at Ottowa, Canada,\nconstitutes an important step and commitment towards the\nconsolidation of mechanisms for world peace.\nFirmly based on the principle of encouraging the\npeaceful resolution of disputes and the search for peace\nand security in our region, the Dominican Republic has\npromoted the strengthening of its neighbourly relations.\nFor the first time in more than half a century, a\nDominican President visited the Republic of Haiti. That\nevent and the agreements reached favour the efforts\nundertaken by the democratic Governments of both States\nthrough dialogue and accord, which is the best way to\napproach their common problems.\nIt is in this new context of our bilateral relations that\nwe wish to appeal to the international community to\ncontinue to provide support to Haiti. The need that\nbrought about the commitment of the United Nations to\nthe recovery of our neighbouring country still remains.\nThe Dominican Republic has met the challenges of\nworld changes at the end of this century. The restoration\nof diplomatic relations with the fraternal country of Cuba\n42\n\n\nconstituted an inevitable step that formalized our long-\nlasting relations with Cuba.\nOur country seeks inclusion in the integrationist trend\nin our geographic and geopolitical area. Thus, this year we\nsigned two free-trade treaties, one with the five countries of\nCentral America, and the other with the 14 members of the\nCaribbean Community. Both agreements are modern,\nadvanced and comprehensive, as they deal with trade in\ngoods and services and with investment and are in keeping\nwith the principles of the World Trade Organization. They\nare conducive to economic growth, the creation of more\nand better jobs and improvement in the quality of life of\nour citizens.\nOther clear signs of this regional rapprochement and\nparticipation are the two presidential events held in our\ncountry. In November 1997 the city of Santo Domingo was\nthe site of the extraordinary summit of heads of State of the\nCentral American countries, including Belize, as well as of\nthe Dominican Republic, and more recently, in August of\nthis year, of the extraordinary meeting of heads of State and\nGovernment of the Caribbean Forum. Both meetings led to\nagreements and concrete positions regarding hemispheric\nand global challenges that our region must confront.\nAt the same time, we have tightened our economic,\npolitical and development ties with the other nations of our\nregion, through the presence of our President, Mr. Leonel\nFern\u00e1ndez, at the Summit of the Americas and the Ibero-\nAmerican Summit through bilateral visits and exchanges at\nthe presidential level with the United States, Mexico,\nVenezuela and Colombia, countries with which we\ntraditionally share close bonds. These regular presidential\nexchanges have led to consensus on basic topics on the\ninternational agenda and have deepened our levels of\ncooperation.\nAllow me now to speak out the values of democracy\nfrom a basically social approach, since people are the true\nand ultimate raison d?\u00eatre of democracy. Human rights and\nfundamental freedoms will be fully respected and\nguaranteed only when each citizen has a reasonable life\nexpectancy with access to health systems and the\nopportunity for education in a healthy ecological\nenvironment.\nAs is well known, in order to achieve these objectives,\nlarge public expenditures in these areas are necessary. Two\nfactors make this difficult: the external debt, a heavy\nburden which has dragged us down since the 1980s, and the\ncurrent financial crisis, which affects various countries of\nthe world, including some in Latin America. Both factors\ndrain away resources that could have financed social\ndevelopment in this part of the world. The consequences\nare obvious. Unable to improve the living conditions of\nour people and help them become integrated into the\nglobal economy, poverty grows and democracy and\nstability are weakened.\nThe greatest problem facing the international\ncommunity is how to deal with the enormous economic\nand social imbalance from which most Member States\nsuffer, with the gap between the rich and the poor\ncountries and with the growth in global poverty. The role\nof the United Nations should be strengthened in\nformulating and coordinating policies for cooperation and\nin providing technical and financial assistance to\ndeveloping countries.\nHuman resources must take priority during the\ncurrent transformation of the international, political and\neconomic order. Women in particular must play an\nimportant role, as they constitute a dedicated, responsible\nand active workforce and give us reasons to see\nhumankind as being at the centre of development and\nprogress.\nThe Dominican Republic understands that\nstrengthening the role of women in the political, social\nand economic life of Member States is essential if we are\nto reduce poverty and social inequality and promote\ndemocracy and sustainable development. That is why it is\nessential to give priority to policies and programmes that\nbroaden women?s participation in these areas.\nWe vigorously support the objectives and work of\nthe United Nations International Research and Training\nInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW).\nThe plans to improve the contribution of women to the\ndevelopment of their countries, in accordance with their\nown needs, set up when INSTRAW was created,\ncontinues to be of primary importance and deserves\ncontinued support from Member States.\nCreating a new international order is a political\nchallenge. The conditions for this new order require the\nmultilateral system to guarantee security and governability\nwithin the framework of respect for human rights. In\ncelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which has been a guiding\nlight for building a more just world, we hope that respect\nfor human rights will become daily practice for all\npeople.\n43\n\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that the United Nations must\nreflect on and accept the changes that are necessary for our\nOrganization. That is why we enthusiastically support the\nreform programme, which will hope will respond to the\nexpectations of a United Nations in tune with our time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to\nextend to Mr. Didier Opertti the Ethiopian delegation\u2019s\ncongratulations on his well-deserved unanimous election\nto preside over the fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly. We are fully confident that under his guidance\nthe work of this session of the General Assembly will\nmeet with resounding success.\nI should like also to express our appreciation to the\noutgoing President for the most effective guidance he\nprovided to the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly and for the most valuable contribution he has\nmade in this regard.\nWe are indeed deeply indebted to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has tried to inject new\nvitality into the United Nations and who has, under\ndifficult circumstances, continued to make a difference at\nthe helm of the Organization. We appreciate very deeply\nin particular what the Secretary-General has been doing\nto ensure that the voices of all those whose viewpoints\nneeded to be heard are heard, and that there is a more\neffective cooperation between the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\nI wish in this regard to commend him with great\nsatisfaction for what can only be called the historic report\nhe has submitted on the causes of conflict and the\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development\nin Africa. This report, on which the Secretary-General has\ndeservedly already been congratulated by many, raises all\nthose issues which are vital for the future of Africa and\ntreats them with such frankness and transparency that I\ncan only hope that we will all have the necessary resolve\nand commitment to follow up its recommendations and\nensure their implementation.\nWe in Africa have made, over the past few years,\ntremendous efforts to change Africa\u2019s image and reality.\nDespite the apparent slips of the past few months, what\n9\n\n\nhas been achieved on our continent since the early 1990s\nshould not be underestimated. This applies both to activities\nin the economic area as well as to the work for peace and\nstability on our continent.\nThe past few years have demonstrated quite vividly\nhow most African countries, including my own, Ethiopia,\nhave shown the necessary determination to create a\ndomestic climate conducive to economic growth and\ndevelopment. There is today hardly any country in Africa\nwhich has not acknowledged that the economic future of\ncountries lies in market-based and private-sector-driven\neconomic transformation and which has not taken the\nappropriate steps to that end. It is indeed gratifying to note\nthat the results, certainly in my own country, have been\nencouraging.\nHowever, it is hardly disputable that our performance\nin the economic area has not by any means measured up to\nour expectations and that it has been far below what is\nneeded to prevent hopelessness and despair on our\ncontinent, especially among the younger generation.\nAlthough the reasons that provide part of the explanation\nfor this may not be wanting, it is nonetheless very obvious\nthat the well-known limitations we face in international\neconomic cooperation, in particular in the area of trade and\nin connection with the debt burden, constitute the major\nimpediments to Africa\u2019s economic regeneration.\nConsequently, the Secretary-General has reiterated in his\nreport that there is indeed an urgent need for political will\nto ensure sustainable growth and development in Africa, not\nonly on our part as Africans but also on the part of the\ninternational community as a whole.\nIn the past few years we in Africa have also made\nevery effort, in particular through subregional organizations,\nto work for peace and to prevent and contain conflicts. In\nthis regard, the establishment by the OAU of a Mechanism\nfor Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in\nAfrica has been a major step we have taken, and our\nachievement on this score over the past few years should\nnot be underestimated.\nIn our own subregion, we have continued to exert the\nnecessary efforts for peace in the Sudan and to assist the\npeople of Somalia in achieving national reconciliation and\nestablish a broad-based Government and a central authority.\nIn both cases, while success has not been easily won, the\nefforts we are making have nonetheless continued because\nof the conviction, including on the part of our partners in\nthe international community, that there is no effective\nalternative to these efforts carried out at the subregional\nlevel through the mechanism of the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD).\nBut it is very clear that the gains, however small,\nmade over the past few years in the area of peace and\nsecurity in Africa have been tested very severely in the\npast few months. Developments in the Great Lakes\nregion, most particularly in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, represent some of the serious sources of\nconcern we have in this regard. Nevertheless, we remain\nhopeful that a way out of this looming danger in the\nGreat Lakes region will be found based on full respect for\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries of\nthe region, including the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, and on the full recognition of the security\nconcerns of all countries of the region.\nIt is Ethiopia\u2019s firm conviction that there is no\nalternative as a guarantee for peace and amity among\nStates to the scrupulous observance of all of the principles\nof international law governing inter-State relations.\nHowever, the greatest danger for peace in this\nconnection is not so much the violation of international\nlaw per se, but the response by the international\ncommunity in the face of such violation. When the\ninternational community, for whatever reason, fails to\nrespond to aggression and to violations of international\nlaw with the required indignation and resolve, then\naggressors are sent, wittingly or unwittingly, the message\nthat the principles of international law are not there to\nunderpin the peace and that laws are there to be violated\nwith impunity.\nThis has been the lesson that we have drawn from\none of the major recent disappointments that we have had\nin the area of peace and security in Africa. I am, of\ncourse, referring here to the naked aggression by the State\nof Eritrea against Ethiopia on 12 May 1998. Despite the\nefforts by various parties, this aggression continues to\nportend the outbreak of a full-scale war between the two\ncountries because, on the one hand, of Eritrea\u2019s\nintransigence in insisting that the peaceful resolution of\nthe crisis must be linked to Ethiopia\u2019s acceptance of the\nloss of its sovereignty over a part of its territory and to\nthe consequent appeasement of Eritrea, and, on the other,\nof the dangerous impression the international community\nis conveying: that aggression entails not costs to the\naggressor, but rewards.\nThe aggression committed by the Eritrean regime\nagainst Ethiopia is unprecedented in more ways than one.\n10\n\n\nFirst, it is aggression that was not only unprovoked but was\nalso carried out against a State that, until the day of the\naggression, was a true friend of Eritrea \u2014 probably the\nonly true friend Eritrea had until that day of infamy when\nit decided to stab Ethiopia in the back. Secondly, this is an\naggression that, paradoxical as it may seem, was designed\nto impose Eritrea\u2019s will and policy on a country that is in\nno shape or form suited to play second fiddle to Eritrea. It\nis quite possible that Ethiopia\u2019s preoccupation with\ndevelopment and with the fight against poverty over the\npast several years might have created the wrong impression\nin the minds of Eritrea\u2019s leaders, with their fixation on\nmuscle-flexing and military might.\nConscious of its responsibility not only for its own\npeople but also for peace and the image of our subregion,\nEthiopia has exerted and continues to exert the maximum\npossible effort to ensure the peaceful resolution of this\ncrisis, which was created solely by the Eritrean aggression\nagainst Ethiopia and the subsequent occupation of Ethiopian\nterritory. Our full cooperation with the various efforts made\nin this regard \u2014 ranging from the United States-Rwandan\nfacilitation to the ongoing effort by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity \u2014 attests to the maximum amount of self-\nrestraint that Ethiopia has demonstrated under difficult\ncircumstances and in the complete absence of a rational and\nreasonable partner for peace on the part of Eritrea since the\nearly days of the aggression.\nThe origin of the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea\nis not in any bilateral dispute between the two countries;\nrather it is the result of aggression \u2014 an unprovoked\naggression which constitutes a flagrant violation of\ninternational law. To many this Eritrean aggression against\nEthiopia has been incomprehensible. But to those who, like\nus, are familiar with the internal Eritrean situation, the\nbehaviour of the Eritrean Government stems directly from\nthe total absence in Eritrea of the normal characteristics of\na State. The absolute failure of institutions, the absence of\nthe rule of law and the lack of accountability can explain\nthe aggressive behaviour of the Eritrean leadership towards\nits neighbours ever since the establishment of Eritrea as an\nindependent State. As a result, these factors also constitute\nthe single most important cause for the current crisis\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nThe fact that aggression was committed against\nEthiopia by Eritrea has been indisputable for some time\nnow. This has been the position and conclusion of all those\nwho have so far tried, under the difficult circumstances\nposed by Eritrea\u2019s obduracy and lack of civility, to make\ntheir good offices available as facilitators and as brokers of\npeace in this conflict. No one who has been intimately\ninvolved with these various efforts for peace between\nEthiopia and Eritrea would fail to see that Eritrea has\nnever, ever been prepared to give peace a chance. No one\nwho has been close to the efforts made so far to resolve\nthe crisis peacefully would fail to have noted not only the\nabsolute disregard for peace on the part of the Eritrean\nauthorities, but also their attempt to conceal the truth,\ntheir lack of transparency and their sheer failure to\ndemonstrate the minimum decency towards all those who\nhave tried to help. Nevertheless, it is indeed regrettable\nthat some, jettisoning their principles, seem to have drawn\nthe conclusion that, in the face of the known irrationality\nbordering on the insane in Eritrea, what needs to be done\nis to lean on Ethiopia, the victim of the aggression, to\ncompromise on principles and to agree to the\nappeasement of the aggressor and to reward aggression.\nTwo things must not be overlooked by the\ninternational community with regard to the enormous\nimplications of Eritrea\u2019s aggression against Ethiopia for\ninternational law and for the future of peace and stability\nin our subregion. First, it must be recognized that this is\nprecisely a trap laid by the Eritrean authorities in the form\nof a deliberately designed game of chicken, calculated,\nthese authorities hope, to end with rewarding aggression.\nNeedless to say, Ethiopia refuses to play according to the\nEritrean script, and we call upon the international\ncommunity to take the same resolute stand.\nSecondly, it should never be assumed that through\nappeasement war would be averted and that durable peace\ncan be ensured in our part of the world. Although because\nof its recent history this part of the world admittedly\nneeds peace most, it cannot be expected to pay any price\nto avoid war, in particular by accommodating aggressors.\nClearly it stands to reason, and history has amply\ndemonstrated, that war in the long run cannot be averted\nby appeasing aggressors.\nIt is a total illusion to believe that Eritrea will be\ntamed, and we are saying this from experience. One just\nhas to look at Eritrea\u2019s track record of the past few years\nin our area. Eritrea\u2019s propensity to aggression manifested\nitself first in its belligerent attitude towards its neighbours\nover the past seven years and has culminated in its most\nextreme form of aggression against Ethiopia. In the face\nof such a destructive attitude one may ask why such\nbelligerence by Eritrea was tolerated for so long. The\nanswer is that, since we believed that the transition from\nleading a liberation movement to running an independent\nState would take time, we somehow entertained the hope\n11\n\n\nthat the Eritrean leadership would mature over time, as is\nthe case in almost all other similar circumstances. But our\nhopes were finally dashed on 12 May 1998. In light of this,\nwe have absolutely no doubt that, if we fail to tell the\nEritrean authorities in no uncertain terms that their unruly\nbehaviour cannot be tolerated any longer, the result will be\neven greater instability and interminable conflict in the\nsubregion, and it will have enormous implications for peace\nand stability in our continent.\nThat is why the Ethiopian Government and people\nfirmly believe that this flagrant violation of international\nlaw by a small nation that is totally blinded by arrogance\nand led astray by a leadership that has concluded that\nbrinkmanship will always pay should not be left\nunchallenged. On our part, whether the international\ncommunity stands with us or not on the fundamental\nprinciple of preserving international law and resisting\naggression, regardless of the consequences, we are prepared\nto stand alone, if need be on principle as well as for our\nnational dignity.\nThis, as we all remember, would not be the first time\nfor Ethiopia to be in such a situation. In this connection,\none is reminded of Emperor Haile Selassie and the League\nof Nations following Italian aggression against Ethiopia in\n1936. The measure proposed at the time against Italy was\nthe imposition of an oil embargo, which certainly would\nhave been effective in crippling Italian aggression against\nEthiopia. Nevertheless, since appeasing Fascist Italy was\nthe preferred option for the great Powers of the time, the\nproposal was rejected. Instead, in a clear demonstration of\ninjustice unprecedented in the history of inter-State\nconflicts, an arms embargo was imposed by the League on\nboth the aggressor, Italy, and the victim of aggression,\nEthiopia.\nAs a result we all know, as history has recorded, this\ndismal failure of the League of Nations to prevent\naggression was one of the causes which brought about the\ndemise of the organization and later contributed to the\noutbreak of the Second World War. It is Ethiopia\u2019s hope\nthat this shameful episode will not be repeated by the\ninternational community today, although the nature and\nscale of the challenge Ethiopia is facing today is radically\ndifferent, and is not comparable to what it faced during\nthose difficult days on the eve of the Second World War.\nThe United Nations is still grappling with various\nissues affecting international peace and security around the\nworld. Among these, the situation in Angola is a cause for\nserious concern to us. The behaviour of UNITA clearly\nconstitutes a dangerous trend which might lead to the\nderailment of the peace process \u2014 namely, the full\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol. We urge the\nUnited Nations to exert the maximum effort to save the\nfragile situation in Angola and ensure the establishment\nof lasting peace and stability in that country.\nOn the situation in the Middle East, we hope every\neffort will be exerted towards the full implementation of\nthe Oslo accords, with a view to establishing durable\npeace in the area.\nWith regard to the question of Western Sahara, it is\nour earnest hope that the proposed referendum on the\nfuture of the territory will be held as soon as possible to\nbring about a final and successful settlement of the issue.\nAs a founding member of this Organization, Ethiopia\nhas always been prepared to contribute to the best of its\nability to all efforts designed to make the United Nations\nand its various organs more effective and more\nrepresentative. Accordingly, my country attaches great\nimportance to the ongoing exercises aimed, among other\nthings, at reforming and restructuring the Security\nCouncil. A satisfactory, fruitful and expeditious outcome\nof this process is indeed vital for the effectiveness,\ncredibility and, I might add, the enhanced legitimacy of\nthe world body.\nFor Ethiopia, and for all those who have trust in the\nefficacy of multilateralism, there is no alternative to the\nUnited Nations. The Organization should therefore be\nprotected, and what it stands for \u2014 whether in the areas\nof economic cooperation, disarmament or human rights \u2014\nshould be promoted and fostered with all dedication and\ncommitment. In this endeavour, Ethiopia will continue to\nbe second to none in discharging its responsibilities to the\nUnited Nations in this and other activities of the\nOrganization.\nI therefore wish to conclude by renewing Ethiopia\u2019s\ncommitment to the United Nations and to what it stands\nfor.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate\nMr. Opertti on his accession to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. His election is a tribute\nto his friendly country and an expression of confidence in\nhis ability to shoulder this great responsibility.\nI also take this opportunity to express our deep\nappreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his skilful\nguidance of the deliberations of the previous session of\nthe General Assembly. Furthermore, I would also like to\nexpress my country?s high appreciation to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his initiatives, which have helped\nease tensions in a number of regions, and for his efforts\nin making a series of serious proposals for the reform of\nthe United Nations and to reactivate its role, thereby\nallowing it to perform the functions entrusted to it by the\nCharter.\nThe United Nations is the only Organization which\nenjoys universal membership. That is why it is the sole\nforum qualified to deal with urgent international, political,\neconomic and social problems. To address these questions\neffectively, it is essential, first and foremost, to observe\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which\nmust govern both the work of the Organization and the\nconduct of its Members. Our commitment to the\nprinciples of sovereign equality, non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of States and abstention from the threat or\nuse of force requires us to oppose the ambitions and\npractices of certain countries that seek to impose their\nhegemony and influence and to monopolize privileges.\nThe mandated powers of the General Assembly, in\nparticular, should be expanded to allow it to play its\nrightful role, which is based on equality among all its\nmembers and on the fact that they all deliberate on an\nequal footing, including in their consideration of questions\nof international peace and security. It would be helpful in\nthis respect to establish a mechanism to enable the\nAssembly to oversee the work of other organs, including\nthe Security Council, and to hold them accountable to it.\nAny wealthy country in arrears that cares about the\nUnited Nations should pay those arrears immediately and\nunconditionally, because they are to blame for the\n17\n\n\nfinancial deterioration affecting the activities of the\nOrganization.\nThe reform of the United Nations will remain\nincomplete without reforming the Security Council to\neliminate the privilege of the veto power. Historically and\nin terms of justice, equality and democracy, there is no\nlonger any justification for that power. My country was the\nfirst to call for the abrogation of the veto power in the\nsecond half of this century. Moreover, it is essential to\nremove the current imbalance in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, not by granting certain countries\npermanent membership, but through an increase in the\nnumber of its members, based on the principle of full\nsovereign equality among States and the application of the\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution in both\ncategories of Council membership: permanent and non-\npermanent. The reform of the Council should, first and\nforemost, respond to the needs of the developing countries,\nwhich constitute the majority of the United Nations\nmembership, and to the need to avoid selectivity.\nDespite the efforts of African countries and their\nOrganization, conflict is on the rise and economic\nconditions are further deteriorating on that continent.\nWhatever development or increase in income they achieve\ngoes to servicing debts that weigh heavily on them all. In\nhis report on the situation in Africa, the Secretary-General\nexplains that this situation is the result of the policies\nadopted by the colonial Powers at the 1885 Congress of\nBerlin to partition the continent. These policies remain the\nroot cause of conflict in Africa. The report further indicates\nthat Africa?s problems, including political instability in\nsome parts and economic underdevelopment in most of the\ncontinent, were caused by those who drew the political\nborders of African countries. We call for the cancellation of\nAfrica?s debts and for the continent to be dealt with on new\nand fair bases, not just as a source of raw materials and a\nmarket for the consumption of manufactured goods.\nThe responsibility for all that has happened and is still\ntaking place on the African continent falls to those who\ncaused it in the first place. Therefore, it is high time for the\nStates that colonized Africa, exploited its resources and\nenslaved its peoples to apologize to the continent and to\npay full compensation for all the losses it has incurred as\na result of colonialism.\nThe imposition of restrictions on international trade\nand the legislation of extraterritorial laws require serious\naction on our part to confront and put an end to them.\nMember States are called upon to support and vote in\nfavour of the relevant draft resolution to be submitted to\nthe General Assembly at this session and not to recognize\nsuch unilateral laws, which undermine the lofty principles\nof the United Nations Charter, flagrantly violate the rules\nof international law, encroach on the sovereignty of\nMember States and blatantly interfere in their internal\naffairs.\nThe question of Palestine is still awaiting a solution.\nAll developments, past and present, serve only to confirm\nwhat my country has repeatedly stated: Occupation by\nforce and the dictation and imposition of surrender can\nnever lead to peace. No support for the occupation and\nthe settlement policy or undermining of the balance of\npower will help to establish peace. The displaced\nPalestinians living outside their land are far more\nnumerous than those who live on Palestinian territory.\nWhat kind of peace is it that prevents a people from\nreturning to their territory, their homeland?\nThe continued occupation of the Syrian Golan since\n1967, the occupation of southern Lebanon, and the way\nin which the Security Council has been prevented from\nimplementing its resolution 425 (1978) are further proof\nof the weakening of the United Nations as a result of the\nintervention of the major Powers. In this respect, we\nwould ask: Why does the Security Council insist on the\nimplementation of some and not all of its resolutions? So\nlong as the United Nations remains paralysed by the\nblatant interference of the powerful, who exploit it only\nto serve their own interests and prevent it from acting\nwhen there is a question of deterring or repulsing\naggression by their allies, this glaring injustice will\ncontinue to push the Middle East towards the abyss.\nThe achievement of the universality of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nexpansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones are facing major\nobstacles. In the Arab East, the rulers of Tel Aviv still\nrefuse to adhere to the NPT. They refuse to place their\nnuclear facilities under the control regime of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. They continue to\ndevelop their nuclear capabilities with the financial and\ntechnical support of the United States, the very country\nthat, under the pretext of saving the world from chemical\nweapons, threatens to attack any Arab country, including\nmy own, merely for building a pharmaceutical plant. The\nrecent destruction of the Sudanese pharmaceutical factory\nunder such flimsy pretexts, later proven false, is still fresh\nin our minds.\n18\n\n\nNobody should be deceived by the utterings of the\nrulers of Tel Aviv to the effect that the Arabs and their\nweapons are a source of danger. Neither Libya nor any\nother Arab State constitutes a threat to the peace of the\nregion, let alone the whole world. These are countries that\nneither produce nor export weapons. Washington has\ndestroyed the weapons that Iraq once had and has imposed\nembargoes on other countries to prevent Iraq from\nimporting arms. The real danger to security in the region\nand the entire world comes from the Israelis, who possess\nhundreds of nuclear warheads. So long as nuclear weapons\nand other weapons of mass destruction are not destroyed in\nall the countries that possess them, any lesser effort will\nrepresent a great attempt to deceive the whole world.\nSince the dawn of time, humanity has been afflicted\nby a phenomenon that has been exacerbated in modern\ntimes: national and international terrorism. The annals of\nhistory record terrorist acts, their victims and their\nperpetrators. If we peruse these records, much is revealed.\nThey show that those self-styled fighters against terrorism\nwere the first to perpetrate terrorism. By posing as fighters\nof terrorism, they are trying to cover the terrorist crimes\nthey have committed and still commit against other\ncountries and peoples. Their history is no more than a\nseries of terrorist acts against other peoples, which have\nreached the stage of total annihilation of entire peoples.\nThese self-styled fighters of terrorism have attempted\nto brand movements of liberation and the struggle for\nfreedom and against occupation as terrorist. They still\ndescribe all fighters for freedom and independence as\nterrorists. But they fail miserably when most fighters for the\nfreedom and independence of their countries eventually\ntriumph. Suddenly, those who fought against these freedom\nfighters and backed those who enslaved them are ready to\nroll out the red carpet for them, organize the greatest\nreceptions and award them the highest medals. This General\nAssembly embraces a number of such leaders every year\nand, only a few days ago, gave the fighter and leader\nNelson Mandela an outstanding reception.\nLibya is proud to have been among the countries that\nsupported these leaders during their struggle. Libya takes\npride in their victories. Libya took that position at a time\nwhen those who now claim to fight terrorism used to\ndescribe those leaders as terrorists. Libya knows that the\nchange in these countries? attitudes following the triumph\nof revolutionaries and freedom fighters neither reflects\nprincipled morality, nor aims at atoning for past mistakes.\nIt is due to a desire to preserve their interests and to gain\ngreater political and economic advantages.\nWhen we talk of terrorism, we should know our\nsubject. Our talk must be objective and we need to agree\non a single definition of terrorism. We should apply the\nsame criteria and the same rules and laws. We must also\nimplement the same measures and procedures. We cannot\ncondemn terrorism and fight it when it hits a certain\ncountry, then turn a blind eye when it hits other countries\nor other peoples. The occupation of Lebanon, the\nsurrounding of its capital and the attack on Qana were\nacts of terrorism. The aggression against Libya in 1986\nand earlier was terrorism. The invasion of Grenada was\nterrorism. The kidnapping of a head of State is terrorism.\nMaintaining military bases on other peoples? territory is\nterrorism. Navies? threats and attacks against peoples and\nviolation of their territorial waters \u2014 this is terrorism.\nAttempts on the lives of national leaders are terrorism.\nThe downing of a Libyan civilian airplane over Sinai was\nterrorism. The downing of the Iranian airplane in the Gulf\nwas terrorism. Forcing the Security Council to react to a\nmissile that fell in the sea and preventing it from reacting\nto missiles that were intentionally launched against a\npharmaceutical plant in a peaceful city, Khartoum, and\nfrom sending a mere fact-finding mission \u2014 this is\nterrorism. In this respect, we forcefully support Sudanese\ndemands for investigation and compensation and condemn\nthis terrorist aggression.\nAre we supposed to condemn terrorism only when\nit touches a certain country or countries? Should we turn\na blind eye and a deaf ear to what is being committed by\nthat country or those countries against humanity as a\nwhole? This, too, is terrorism. Terrorism will be\neradicated only when its causes, not just its results, are\naddressed; not by committing similar terrorist acts. We\ncannot fight terrorism with terrorism. As one Arab poet\nsays:\n\u201cPractise what you preach. Great shame on you if\nyou do not.\u201d\nWe in Libya condemn terrorist acts, their\nperpetrators, their sponsors and those who finance them.\nWe are ready to cooperate with all countries that truly\nwant to put an end to terrorism. Libya, in a letter to the\nSecretary-General dated 9 January 1992 (document\nA/46/840), was the first to call on the United Nations to\nconvene a special session of the General Assembly to be\ndevoted to international terrorism.\nIn this respect, we wish to note that some people\ninsist, in and out of context, on linking Islam and\nMuslims to terrorism. This in itself is another kind of\n19\n\n\nterrorism. The very name of Islam is derived from the word\nsalaam, which means \u201cpeace\u201d. A person is considered a\nMuslim when others are safe from his words and his deeds.\nThe greeting of Muslims, when coming or going, is\nassalamu alaikum, meaning \u201cpeace be upon you\u201d, and the\nanswer is \u201cand the same to you\u201d.\nIt seems believable that, as has been demonstrated in\nsome works and studies, certain people can determine their\nown identity only by identifying their enemy. Now that the\nideological enemy, embodied for several decades in the\ncommunist ideology, has disappeared, they have chosen\nIslam as their new alternative adversary. Upon the\ndisappearance of the international opponent, the former\nSoviet Union, they chose the Muslims to be the new\nenemy.\nAt this juncture, let us ask the following questions,\nthough we know in advance that they will go unanswered.\nFirst, who recruited, transported, financed, trained and\narmed those who fought in Afghanistan during the presence\nof Soviet troops there? Secondly, who called these people\nmujahidin when they fought against the Soviets in\nAfghanistan? And who now calls them terrorists? How and\nwhy did yesterday?s mujahid become today?s terrorist?\nThirdly, where do the leaders of the organizations which\nplan and supervise the implementation of terrorist actions\nin their homelands live? Sisterly Algeria is not the only\nexample. Fourthly, who protects these people? Who\nfinances them? Who arms them? Who trains them? Where?\nAnd Why?\nThese and other, similar questions will not be publicly\nacknowledged by the parties concerned, but that does not\nmean that there is no answer. Islam is the victim. Muslims\nare the targets and victims of terrorism, alongside the rest\nof third world peoples. God Almighty addresses his Prophet\nand Messenger in the Koran by saying:\n\u201cWe sent thee not, but as a mercy for all creatures.\u201d\n(The Holy Koran, XXI:107)\nVerily spoke God. The Prophet of mercy preached the\nreligion of mercy, not terrorism.\nMy country has always sought to make the\nMediterranean a region of security, cooperation and peace.\nIt is a source of satisfaction that in July this year we issued\na joint statement with Italy which eliminated many aspects\nof the legacy of the past and laid down a solid basis for\ncooperation to serve the interests of both countries and\npeoples and contribute to the strengthening of peace and\nstability in that strategic part of the world. We believe\nthat this is a model that should be emulated in other\narrangements, including European and Mediterranean\npartnerships. Among the issues on which the peoples of\nthe Mediterranean should cooperate and act in solidarity\nis the foreign military presence in the region. We in\nLibya would again like to express our concern about this\npresence. We again call on foreign States to dismantle\ntheir military bases around the Mediterranean and\nwithdraw their fleets from its waters. Their presence\nposes a danger to the peoples of the region.\nThe world is still witnessing a continuation of old\ndisputes and conflicts such as those in Cyprus,\nAfghanistan, Angola and Somalia. These conflicts have\npersisted for too long, despite all the efforts made to\nresolve them peacefully. The international community\nshould increase its efforts to settle these disputes and end\nthe suffering of their peoples.\nThe people of Iraq are suffering from international\nsanctions which are unprecedented in their severity and\ncruelty. These sanctions have resulted in human tragedies\nwhich could never be accepted by principled human\nbeings. Other countries have exploited these sanctions in\norder to achieve their own selfish political purpose of\ndestroying Iraq, violating its territorial integrity and\nbreaking up its unity. This will have disastrous\nconsequences sooner or later. Furthermore, it is a\nviolation of the Charter, the principles of international law\nand all international norms.\nIn the Horn of Africa the situation in Somalia is still\na source of great concern. My country has consistently\nmade efforts to assist the competing Somali factions solve\ntheir differences. We will continue those efforts with a\nview to reaching a solution to ensure Somali national\nreconciliation that is satisfactory to all Somalis. The\nJamahiriya, which has the honour of presiding over the\ngroup of Sahel and desert countries, has submitted a\nserious initiative for the settlement of the dispute between\nEthiopia and Eritrea. This initiative, which enjoys full\nrecognition, remains the best framework for the solution\nof the border dispute between the two countries and the\nnormalization of relations between their two peoples.\nI should now like to provide an account of the latest\ndevelopments in the dispute between my country and the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie\nquestion. In this regard, I shall deal with the latest, not\nthe oldest, of these developments. On 21 July the media\nannounced that the United States and the United Kingdom\n20\n\n\nwere considering the possibility of accepting the two\nsuspects for trial in a third country, which may be the\nNetherlands.\nLibya contacted the President of the Security Council\nand most of its members, as well as the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, to welcome this development in the event\nthat it became an official position. To prove and confirm its\nseriousness, Libya suggested to them that the Secretary-\nGeneral should look into the matter once it became an\nofficial position and contact all the parties to seek to reach\na practical and serious formula that would respond to the\ninterests of all the parties and could gain their approval.\nOur intention was that if such a formula were submitted to\nthe Security Council, its approval would be assured and its\nimplementation would thereby be a foregone conclusion.\nAt the time, Libya expressed a number of fears and\nconcerns to which it drew attention and warned against the\nSecurity Council approving any formula that did not\naddress such fears and concerns in its enthusiasm of feeling\nthat there was a positive development on the issue.\nAt that time \u2014 the last week of July \u2014 we drew\nattention to the fact that Libya was concerned that the other\nparty might have taken its approach for certain short-term\nreasons: first, to circumvent the two Judgments of the\nInternational Court of Justice; secondly, to pre-empt the\ndecision taken at the Ouagadougou summit; thirdly, to\nforestall a potential resolution at the Durban summit;\nfourthly, to continue the sanctions imposed on Libya;\nfifthly, to distance between the international community and\nsupport for Libya by misleading it into believing that the\nother party had already accepted the proposals of regional\nand international organizations; and sixthly, to take the\nwhole question back to its starting point.\nAt that time, before the official position of the two\ncountries was made public and as a test of the seriousness\nof the other party, Libya stressed the need for certain\nconsiderations. First, we requested a guarantee that the two\nsuspects would not be handed over or moved to either the\nUnited States or the United Kingdom. Secondly, we asked\nfor a guarantee of their legal, religious, social, personal and\nhealth rights throughout the various phases of the trial.\nThirdly, we requested that the Libyan judicial authorities\nand the defence of the two suspects should handle all\ntechnical, legal questions relevant to the legal aspect of the\ntrial. We were now talking about a legal and not a political\nmatter. The legal and judicial authorities of the countries\nconcerned had done so with regard to their side of the\nquestion.\nOur intuition proved right and our suspicions were\nconfirmed. On Monday, 24 August 1998, the United\nStates and the United Kingdom addressed a joint letter to\nthe Secretary-General to which they attached the text of\na draft agreement between the Government of the\nKingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the\nUnited Kingdom, together with the text of a bill which\nthe United Kingdom intended to enact as law to enable\nthe Scottish Court to conduct the trial in the Netherlands.\nOn Tuesday, 25 August, the two countries submitted\na draft resolution to the Security Council. On Wednesday,\n26 August, the draft resolution was formally submitted to\nthe Council. On Thursday, 27 August, as we expected, the\nSecurity Council approved the draft resolution, motivated\nby a feeling that it was a positive development, without\npausing to discover the poison that was slipped\nsurreptitiously into the honey.\nThe letter sent to the Secretary-General, together\nwith its detailed and complicated legal attachments, was\napproved without giving even the members of the\nSecurity Council a chance to study them. Libya then\nrequested the Council to postpone acting on the resolution\nbecause it and its attachments required consideration by\nthe competent Libyan judicial authorities. These\ndocuments had not at that time reached Libya and had not\neven been translated into Arabic.\nThe adversary and the arbiter in the Council\nprevented the Council from responding to Libya?s request.\nDuring the review session last March, the same adversary\nand the same arbiter prevented the Council from studying\nthe Judgments of the International Court of Justice,\nofficially referred to it by Libya, under the pretext that\nthese Judgments needed to be studied by legal experts in\ntheir two countries. This stark contradiction in positions\nand criteria we leave to the judgement of the Assembly,\nand we have no doubt that it will reach the right\nconclusions.\nSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998), adopted on\n27 August 1998, suggests that the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya has not implemented the requirements of\nCouncil resolutions, as in paragraph 1 it\n\u201cDemands once again that the Libyan\nGovernment immediately comply with the above-\nmentioned resolutions.\u201d\nThis refers to resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), 883\n(1993). It also suggests that Libya has done nothing in\n21\n\n\nthat connection, whereas Libya has responded fully to all of\nthese resolutions.\nParagraph 4 of resolution 1192 (1998) states that\n\u201cthe Libyan Government shall ensure that any\nevidence or witnesses in Libya are, upon the request\nof the court, promptly made available at the court in\nthe Netherlands for the purpose of the trial\u201d.\nTo ask Libya to provide evidence and witnesses\ncontradicts logic and law. It is not Libya that has accused\nthe two suspects. It is the United States and the United\nKingdom that claim to possess evidence which justifies\ntheir suspicions. They alone have the responsibility to\nprovide the evidence and the witnesses for the prosecution\nin order to prove their case. This demand in itself proves\nthat those two countries have no evidence to support the\naccusation of our two citizens. On what, then, is this\nsuspicion based? It is a suspicion still in search of evidence\nand witnesses. The best quotation we can cite in this\nrespect is the statement made by the freedom fighter and\nleader, President Nelson Mandela, last week in Washington:\n\u201cI know of no system of jurisprudence anywhere in the\nworld where the accused is required to produce witnesses\nfor the prosecution.\u201d\nOn the whole, in the text to which I have been\nreferring, Libya sees interference in the work and\nprocedures of the court, a limitation on the rights of the\naccused to defend themselves, and an abrogation of Libya?s\nlegal rights guaranteed under international law and custom\ngoverning procedures and the provision of proof.\nSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998) referred to the\njoint letter dated 24 August 1998 from the Governments of\nthe United Kingdom and of the United States, contained in\ndocument S/1998/795, to which is annexed the text of the\nintended agreement between the Governments of the\nKingdom of the Netherlands and of the United Kingdom.\nIn its article 16 (2), that agreement refers to the\n\u201ctransfer [of] the accused from the premises of the\nScottish Court [in the Netherlands] to the territory of\nthe United Kingdom ...,\n\u201c(a) ... for the purpose of trial by jury in\nScotland\u201d. (S/1998/795, annex II)\nHowever, the initiative adopted by the Security Council,\nwhich in essence is a political initiative, is based on what\nwas adopted by the regional and international organizations\nwhose letters were cited in the preambular part of\nSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998). Here we would\nlike to refer in particular to the content of the joint letter\nfrom the Secretaries-General of the League of Arab States\nand of the Organization of African Unity, annexed to\ndocument S/1997/497. Any text that would make it\npossible to transfer the two suspects to any place other\nthan the Netherlands, under any circumstances, runs\ncounter to the regional initiatives accepted by the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya. That is only some of the poison in the\nhoney: the world has heard that the United Kingdom and\nthe United States have agreed to have a trial in the\nNetherlands. Now they talk about Scotland, the United\nKingdom and the United States. We shall clarify this\npresently.\nThe letter then states, in paragraph 4, that, \u201cIf found\nguilty, the two accused will serve their sentence in the\nUnited Kingdom\u201d. Moreover, the intended agreement\nstates in article 16 (2) (b) that the accused would be\ntransferred to the United Kingdom \u201cfor the purpose of\nserving a custodial sentence imposed by the Scottish\nCourt following the conviction of the accused\u201d.\nThat contradicts the initiative; I cannot believe that\nanyone understood the initiative to mean anything other\nthan that the trial would take place in a third country.\nThis provision runs counter to the general understanding\nof the initiative, that the purpose of the trial of the two\nsuspects is to reveal the truth in the tragic incident of Pan\nAm flight 103, and not to exact revenge on two Libyan\ncitizens who are merely suspected, without evidence. It is\nthe understanding also that the ultimate venue of all the\ntrial procedures would be in a third country: in the\nNetherlands, and not anywhere else. The agreement by\nthe various parties to the holding of the trial in the\nNetherlands is a political solution that came about as a\nresult of political action. The place where the sentence\nshould be served, if, God forbid, they are convicted,\nshould be the same place as the trial. This is part of the\npolitical solution.\nThey claim that Scottish law stipulates that sentences\nshould be served in Scotland, because Scottish courts sit\nin Scotland. But this court will sit outside Scotland, so\nany sentence should also be carried out outside Scotland.\nThe court is, exceptionally, sitting in another country, so\nthe sentence must be served in the country where the trial\ntakes place, not in Scotland.\nParagraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1192\n(1998) reads in part that the Council\n22\n\n\n\u201cdecides that the aforementioned measures shall be\nsuspended immediately if the Secretary-General\nreports to the Council that the two accused have\narrived in the Netherlands for the purpose of trial\nbefore the court described in paragraph 2 or\u201d \u2014 and\nhere pay attention to this new poison in the honey \u2014\n\u201chave appeared for trial before an appropriate court in\nthe United Kingdom or the United States\u201d.\nIn a dispute that has lasted for more than seven years, this\nis the first time that the Security Council has adopted a\nresolution asserting that the trial can take place before a\ncourt in the United Kingdom or the United States. I have\naddressed a letter to the Secretary-General indicating that\nthe proposal of the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of African Unity regarding a trial under\nScottish law, before a Scottish court, at the International\nCourt of Justice in The Hague defines an \u201cappropriate\ncourt\u201d. But the resolution says\n(spoke in English)\n\u201can appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United\nStates\u201d, not an appropriate British or United States court.\n(spoke in Arabic)\nFor the first time, the resolution refers to such a venue.\nThere is no need for the addition of a reference to an\n\u201cappropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United\nStates\u201d \u2014 unless the purpose is to transfer the two suspects\nto the Netherlands as a transit station before transferring\nthem to one of the two countries mentioned in that\nparagraph. If that is the case, it can be qualified only as\ninstitutional piracy condoned by Security Council\nresolution. The world is unaware of this situation. I know\nthat members are busy with their own concerns, but I\nremind them that I am citing the text of the new Security\nCouncil resolution.\nAlong with the rest of the international community, we\nhave agreed to a trial before a Scottish court sitting in a\nthird country, which could be the Netherlands. We have\nagreed to a Scottish court, to Scottish law and to Scottish\njudges, in the Netherlands. Those are the terms described\nin the decisions of the regional organizations. But what\ndoes that paragraph mean?\nBut Libya never subscribed to these new terms, and\nthe regional organizations never agreed that a trial should\ntake place in the United States or in the United Kingdom.\nTo suggest that this is the \u201cappropriate court\u201d referred to in\nparagraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) is to attempt to\ndeceive the international community, and is yet another\nexample of the poison in the honey. The Council was\nmisled into accepting this because of the existence of a\nfeeling that there was a change in the position of the two\ncountries.\nAnother meaningless reference came in paragraph 8\non the relations between the Libyan Government and the\nFrench judicial authorities, relevant to the explosion of\nUnion de Transports A\u00e9riens flight 772. This question has\nnothing to do with the subject of the initiative upon which\nresolution 1192 (1998) is based. Moreover, it is well\nestablished in the Security Council that Libya has done all\nthat has been required of it by the French judge in this\nrespect and that the French authorities have expressed\ntheir total satisfaction, and this was endorsed by the\nSecurity Council.\nLibya believes that the optimal, pragmatic and\nprompt solution lies in conducting negotiations among all\nparties with a view to reaching an agreement on the\npractical procedures for the application of the option of\ntrying the two suspects before a Scottish court in a neutral\ncountry \u2014 the Netherlands \u2014 as called for by the summit\nof the Non-Aligned Movement held in South Africa at the\nbeginning of September 1998.\nShould direct negotiations prove impossible due to\nthe opposition of the United States and the United\nKingdom, these negotiations can be conducted through the\nSecretary-General. The proposed agreement should\ndetermine all practical measures, the commitments of\neach party and the rights and guarantees to be accorded\nthe two suspects and their defence team. It should also\nprecisely state what all the parties are required to do so\nthat the trial of the two suspects will be the final phase of\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions, not\nthe first phase. This should lead to the lifting of the\nsanctions imposed on Libya and put an end to any\nattempts to change positions or otherwise circumvent the\nsituation under the pretext that Libya has not fully\ncomplied with Security Council resolutions \u2014 because\nLibya has fully done what it has been required to do.\nEven the exchange of goods is governed by\nagreements and contracts that regulate and explain the\nresponsibilities of various parties, suppliers and exporters.\nGoods are insured and reinsured against all risks. These\nare people, human beings we are talking about here. They\nare not going to the Netherlands for tourism; we?re not\ngoing to bid them farewell, have a nice trip. Having said\n23\n\n\nthat, we wonder what is meant by electing to hold the trial\nin a military base used by the Americans in the\nNetherlands? Is the base that the Americans use as\nmembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the only\nplace in the Netherlands where the trial can take place?\nWhat is this?\nFollowing are some of the questions that the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya deems it necessary to resolve and reach an\nagreement on. First, there is a need to agree on listing,\nclarifying and determining, in advance, the witnesses\nneeded \u2014 not only from Libya, but from all parties. The\ndefence team should have the right to receive and peruse all\nevidence and cross-examine all witnesses. Secondly, there\nneeds to be agreement on the place where the suspects\nwould spend the time of their sentence in case of\nconviction, either in the Netherlands or in Libya. Thirdly,\nwe need guarantees that the two suspects will not be\nextradited or transferred to either the United States or the\nUnited Kingdom for any reason whatsoever at any phase of\nthe trial. Fourthly, there needs to be an agreement on the\nsecurity, legal, personal, social, health and religious rights\nof the two suspects during the various phases of the trial.\nWe need to conclude an agreement between the\nKingdom of the Netherlands and the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya specifying how the two suspects will be\ntransferred to the Netherlands and guaranteeing their\nsecurity and safety, during their transfer, stay and their\nreturn at the end of the trial. Such an agreement should be\nendorsed by the Security Council and implemented under\nthe supervision of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya has accepted a trial of the two suspects\nbefore a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law,\npresided over by Scottish judges, that would sit in the\nNetherlands, but we will not accept the setting of any\nconditions in relation to the implementation of that\nproposal. Libya is ready to take this exceptional road in\norder to reach a solution to the dispute that would satisfy\nthe interests of all parties and in order to settle the\noutstanding legal issues through direct negotiations or\nthrough the Secretary-General.\nLibya has not interfered in the agreements concluded\nby the other parties for the purposes of the trial. Also, it\nhas not authorized anyone to decide on her behalf matters\nrelating to her citizens, because this is its constitutional\nright and duty. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands\ncan conclude an agreement; this has to do with the\nNetherlands court and because the Netherlands is the seat\nof the court, but as far as the Libyan citizens are\nconcerned, we never authorized anyone to conclude any\nagreements on our behalf. We are responsible for our\ncitizens, the suspects included. They have a team of\nlawyers to defend them. We do not interfere in other\nStates? affairs, nor do we want anyone to interfere with\nour affairs either.\nWe would like to confirm our seriousness, our desire\nand our willingness to close the file of this case and other\nfiles as well, and open a new chapter in our relations with\nthe countries concerned based on mutual respect and non-\ninterference in internal affairs.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your election\nto preside over the fifty-third session of the United\nNations General Assembly is especially gratifying for us\nBrazilians. Brazil and Uruguay came into being as sister\nnations, and our bonds are becoming ever stronger. With\neach passing day, our destinies are more and more linked\ntogether. The opportunity I have of working closely with\nmy friend, Didier Opertti, allows me to say with\nconviction that at this session the Assembly will have a\nformidable President. In the exercise of this important\ntask, you will benefit from the example set by your\npredecessor. At the helm of the fifty-second session,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko was able to guide and motivate\ndelegations and to provide valuable impulse to the\nproposals for reform put forward by the Secretary-\nGeneral.\nBecause of his dedication to the task of modernizing\nour Organization and, above all, because of his decisive\nrole in situations that pose a real threat to international\npeace and security, the Secretary-General deserves our\napplause. The diplomatic talent and serene daring revealed\nby Mr. Kofi Annan confirm that we have in him a leader\nwho is up to the challenges and opportunities before us.\nIt was an honour for us to have welcomed him in Brazil\nthis past July.\nThe defining trait of this particular moment is the\ntroubling instability that besets global financial markets.\nSince the last quarter of 1997, when we first felt the\nshock waves of what was then called the \u201cAsian crisis\u201d,\nthe world economy has been suffering the effects of a\nphenomenon whose reach, depth and permanence are still\nnot clear. But the international community cannot wait,\nwith arms crossed, for the course of events to shed light\non our quandary.\nIt is both legitimate and necessary that Governments\nact to try to prevent problems that may arise. In an era\nmarked by the rapid integration of national economies,\nsuch action by Governments will increasingly have to be\nmade through coordination in the international sphere.\nAlthough there is still no consensus as to the\ndimension of the crisis we face, nor on the prognosis for\nits duration, there seems to be a growing convergence of\npoints of view regarding the impact of the high volatility\nof capital movements. The events of the past few months\n5\n\n\nhave revealed a serious lag between growing financial\ninterdependence and the modest effectiveness of existing\ninternational mechanisms for dialogue and coordination.\nSince the beginning of his Administration, President\nFernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been calling the\nattention of other world leaders to the task of making the\nglobal financial system more stable and predictable. In\nrepeated messages to G-7 members, beginning in 1995, he\noffered concrete proposals: to increase cooperation among\nmonetary authorities; to expand coordination of\nmacroeconomic policies among countries that can have\nconsiderable impact on world finance; to upgrade\ninternational monitoring capacity over domestic\nmacroeconomic policy; and to expand mechanisms aimed\nat stabilizing currencies under speculative attack. There\nhave been, of course, considerable advances along some of\nthese lines, but the measures adopted still fall far short of\nwhat is needed. Until now, political will has not\ncorresponded to the magnitude and gravity of the situation.\nThe crisis will not resolve itself. We must join together to\nface it.\nIn this, as in other fields of international life, we must\navoid at all costs an attitude that, back in the seventies,\nBrazilian Foreign Minister Azeredo da Silveira described as\n\u201cthe postponement syndrome\u201d.\nExperience teaches us that inaction can have a high\ncost. It also teaches that answers given by various countries\nto crisis situations, if guided by irrational or spur-of-the-\nmoment reactions, can turn these situations into even\ngreater problems, prolonging their effects over time and\naggravating people\u2019s suffering.\nOne can imagine extreme scenarios of a return to\nclosed economic models, to the search for elusive self-\nsufficiency and isolation, to notions of national security\nbased on distrust of others and on the insecurity of others.\nSuch scenarios must not become reality. We cannot allow\nit.\nProgress in international relations depends\nfundamentally on the perception of the international arena\nnot as a source of potential threat, but as an environment in\nwhich risks can be reduced and difficulties overcome by a\npooling of wills and resources.\nOurs is not a world in which nations should be left to\ntheir own devices. The cost of such a course is invariably\nhigher than the energy or resources saved by attempts to\ndistance oneself from the problems of others. The\nwillingness to deal collectively with problems will\nmotivate individual countries to believe in the benefit of\nseeking international consideration of matters in their\ndirect interest. The world cannot depend only on the\nwillingness, capacity and interest of a select number of\ncountries to mobilize and lead international efforts in this\nor that direction.\nWe can no longer accept situations, such as the\npresent financial crisis, in which, despite the undeniably\ninternational nature of the phenomenon, Governments and\nsocieties simply do not fully trust any of the existing\norganizations or mechanisms as a source of support,\nguidance or even interpretation of the problem at hand.\nWe must give serious consideration to the fact that\ngrowing interdependence renders indispensable effective\ngovernance at the international level.\nWe have before us an essentially political challenge.\nThis does not mean simply modernizing decision-making\nprocedures or administrative structures, but also giving to\nmultilateral treatment of issues the priority it so often\nreceives in our speeches and statements.\nA large gap still remains between the recognition\nthat the central problems facing humanity must be dealt\nwith at the international level and the resistance of\nGovernments and societies to act in accordance with that\nrecognition. This is most evident in the allocation of\nresources and in the adoption of policies capable of\ngenerating external repercussions.\nIn that same vein, if the link between the national\nand the international is ever greater, peace and\ndevelopment are also increasingly related. A world racked\nby economic instability or despair cannot be a safe\nenvironment, free of the threat of war, conflict and\nviolence. But the reverse is also true: material and social\nprogress presupposes minimal conditions of security and\npeaceful coexistence among and within countries. We\nmust advance on both fronts by working to establish a\nclimate of confidence in the political-strategic realm and\nin the essential context of the global economy.\nBrazil\u2019s relative weight and the history of our\ninternational behaviour are some of our country\u2019s most\nimportant credentials. These credentials are strengthened\ntoday by the maturity of our democracy and by the\nvigorous modernization of the Brazilian economy.\nUnder the leadership of President Cardoso, we have\nrenewed our permanent willingness to play a more active\n6\n\n\nrole in building a world order conducive to peace and\ndevelopment. This spirit guides Brazil\u2019s international action,\nparticularly within the United Nations.\nI wish to point out that, in the Security Council and\nother United Nations bodies, our delegation, led by\nAmbassador Celso Amorim, has faithfully reflected this\ncentral guideline of Brazilian foreign policy.\nIn 1998, we have completed our participation in the\ninternational non-proliferation regime. We have ratified the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\nacceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), which was approved by Brazil\u2019s National\nCongress this past July. Three days ago in Washington, I\nhad the satisfaction of personally depositing the instrument\nof accession to the NPT, in tandem with our Ambassadors\nin London and Moscow.\nThese decisions lend formal and symbolic support to\nthe commitment to use nuclear energy for exclusively\npeaceful purposes. This commitment is enshrined in the\nBrazilian Constitution and is strengthened by the bilateral\nand regional pacts we have signed. The existing agreements\nand the cooperation between Brazil and Argentina, as well\nas the Treaty of Tlatelolco, are exemplary achievements in\nthis field.\nBrazil thus feels particularly motivated to call upon\nnuclear-armed States, and upon those with the capability of\nproducing such weapons, to take decisive steps towards\ndisarmament. We also expect that Governments which have\nstill not become party to the NPT, the CTBT and other\nrelevant instruments and mechanisms will do so at an early\ndate.\nAs an expression of the determination which motivates\nus to work for this cause, Brazil, together with seven other\nfriendly countries, signed the \u201cDeclaration on a Nuclear\nWeapon Free World: the Need for a New Agenda\u201d on 9\nJune of this year. During the current session of the General\nAssembly, together with our partners in the Declaration, we\nintend to present a draft resolution aimed at boosting and\nguiding efforts towards the complete and definitive\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\nThere is no longer room or justification for postponing\naction in the nuclear field or in the broader fight to\neliminate all weapons of mass destruction. The cost of a\nfailure to do so could be truly catastrophic, and the risks\nare evident to all.\nThe Brazilian Government, as the coordinator of the\nguarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, has\nbeen making a sustained effort to assist Ecuador and Peru\nin reaching at the earliest possible date a solid and final\nagreement on the border differences that have kept them\napart for decades. Our diplomatic services \u2014 together\nwith those of Argentina, Chile and the United States \u2014\nstand ready to continue making the best possible\ncontribution.\nRecent developments confirm the prognosis that the\npeace process is on its way to a conclusion and reflect the\npolitical will and the high level of engagement with\nwhich Ecuador and Peru have been working towards that\nend.\nThe fact that South America is a region in which\ncountries essentially live in a harmonious, peaceful and\nincreasingly integrated manner is for Brazil a vital and\ndefining trait that our peoples are determined to preserve.\nThe same applies to the permanence of democratic\nregimes as a common thread of the nations in our\ncontinent. It is a higher value to which we are collectively\ncommitted in the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR), the Rio Group and the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS).\nThe advent and consolidation of democracy was the\ndetermining factor in the extraordinary work of\nintegration in which South American nations are engaged.\nThis is an accomplishment of our societies that the\nGovernments of the region must always be prepared to\ndefend as one. This is a basic tenet of Brazilian foreign\npolicy.\nBrazil attaches the utmost importance to the\nadvancement of human rights. As we celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, we should recognize the persistent gap between\nprinciples and generally accepted rules of international\nlaw, on the one hand, and the prevalent realities of the\nworld, on the other.\nThe Brazilian Government is engaged in the fight to\novercome the distance between norms and facts in our\ncountry. We are prepared to draw from the international\nenvironment elements that may help us realize an\naspiration shared by all Brazilians. This was the main\nthrust of President Cardoso\u2019s submission to the National\nCongress of the decision to recognize the mandatory\njurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\n7\n\n\nPresident Cardoso is also committed to the fight\nagainst the drug trade. His presence at the special session\nof the General Assembly this past June was clear proof of\nthis commitment.\nOur participation in the effort to build a lasting peace\nextends beyond the Americas. The Brazilian military and\npolice have taken part in United Nations forces in many\nparts of the world, particularly in Portuguese-speaking\ncountries in Africa, to which we are bound by history and\nculture.\nBrazil has followed developments in Angola with\nconcern. The United Nations must firmly insist that UNITA\nfulfil the commitments undertaken in the Lusaka Protocol.\nAn unravelling of the situation could jeopardize the\nprogress achieved in the peace process and would be tragic\nindeed. Angolans have been subjected to untold suffering\nfor decades. The international community must do\neverything within its reach so that Angola may finally\ndedicate itself to reconstruction and development.\nThe Brazilian Government, along with the other\nmembers of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\nCountries, is engaged in seeking a peaceful solution to the\ngrave internal crisis faced by Guinea-Bissau. The\nCommunity, in close coordination with countries in the\nregion, has contributed to spurring significant progress. We\nwill continue to pursue favourable conditions for the urgent\nand complete normalization of life in that sister nation.\nAs for East Timor \u2014 to which we are also bound by\nhistory and a common language \u2014 Brazil welcomes the\nnew spirit that presides over this delicate and complex\nissue, especially in the context of the tripartite negotiations\nbetween the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments, under\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General.\nThe Brazilian Government has maintained a positive\ndialogue with the parties involved and is determined to\nassist, to the limit of its possibilities, in finding an adequate\nequation for all concerned, with progressive participation by\nthe Timorese themselves.\nSince the advent of economic stability in 1994, Brazil\nhas shown renewed dynamism with the strengthening of our\ndomestic market and the outlook for development with\nsocial justice.\nBut present-day Brazil does not see its development as\nisolated or self-contained. We realize that the destiny of our\neconomy is increasingly linked to that of the economies of\nour neighbours and partners, in the framework of an\nintegration process that has decidedly contributed to\nprogress in the region and to the well-being of our\nsocieties, particularly within MERCOSUR.\nThe fruits of this process serve not only the goal of\neconomic development but also, and most importantly, the\ncause of social justice, which remains the foremost task\nof our region.\nWe welcome the results of the most recent edition of\nthe United Nations Human Development Report. The\nnumbers show that, in spite of all that remains to be done,\nour country has made extraordinary social progress over\nthe past two decades in the areas of health, education, the\nfight against poverty and the reduction of disparities\namong the various regions of the country. Even though\nwe still face daunting challenges, Brazilians are leading\na better life, as our presence among those nations of\ngreater human development indicates.\nConsistent with its domestic policies and its regional\nrole, Brazil will continue to fight for a more balanced\nallocation of the benefits of economic interdependence,\nwithout distortions such as those resulting from\nprotectionist policies of developed countries.\nSuch policies affect in a particularly cruel manner\nthe developing countries and serve to reinforce the\narguments of those who preach domestically a return to\nclosed economic models. In the current context of global\neconomic turbulence, we must demand that the developed\ncountries establish greater coherence between free-trade\nrhetoric and their unfair trade practices.\nPresident Cardoso has stated that we must abandon\nthe path of globalization with exclusion \u2014 in the\ndecision-making process as well as in the distribution of\nbenefits \u2014 and seek globalization with solidarity in both\nof those dimensions.\nReforming and strengthening the United Nations is\nan essential part of building a world of greater solidarity.\nThe Brazilian Government recognizes the significant\nprogress that has already been made in terms of structural\nand functional modernization of the Organization. We\nagree with the Secretary-General when he says that\nreform must not be seen as an event, but as a process; but\nwe cannot but stress that an important part of that process\nhas yet to be undertaken.\n8\n\n\nFor Brazil, reforming the United Nations necessarily\nimplies updating the functioning and composition of the\nSecurity Council, which still mirrors a period of history that\nis now long gone. That does not mean \u2014 and I have stated\nthis before in this forum \u2014 that the particular interests of\nthis or that country should be taken into account. What it\ndoes mean is that fundamental deficiencies in terms of\nlegitimacy, representativeness and effectiveness must be\nredressed. We will continue to defend expansion in both\ncategories of members, with the presence, in both, of\ndeveloping countries.\nIt is inconceivable that, on the eve of the new\nmillennium, reform of the Organization could exclude the\nrestructuring of the Security Council.\nThe basis of global solidarity is the establishment of\ntrust between societies. There is no other way if we are to\nestablish a peaceful, stable and constructive international\nenvironment. Our so-called global village is still far from\nbecoming a truly integrated community, in which people\ncan consider themselves as participants in the same\nhistorical process.\nOf the many merits of international organizations, one\nof the most important is that they offer a framework of\ninteraction that favours the development of a true sense of\nuniversal communion. In dealing with common problems,\nGovernments learn in practice just how much they need to\nwork more and more closely together. In international\nforums, we are constantly weaving a web of relations based\non a stronger identity and trust between our nations and\ntheir leaders. Countries must trust one another, but they\nmust also have a reason to trust in the legitimacy and\nefficiency of multilateral organizations and procedures in\norder to tackle their most important problems.\nThe dynamics of international life demand a constant\nupdating of the instruments at the disposal of the\ncommunity of nations to allow it to act collectively in the\nface of its greatest challenges.\nWe must have the courage to recognize that never\nbefore have the risks and the cost of procrastination been so\nhigh. We must, above all, have the will to make the\ndecisions that can ultimately restore our faith in ourselves,\nin our capacity to state that history does goes on, and that\nwe are pointing it in the direction of a more just and better\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, to join\npreceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti and the\nmembers of the Bureau on their well-deserved election,\nand to wish them every success in discharging their\nduties. May I also take this opportunity to express my\ndelegation?s deep appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko\nof Ukraine for his outstanding stewardship of the work of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly.\nOne of the pressing issues that mankind is facing\ntoday is globalization and the growing interdependence of\nStates and their effects on international relations. These\nobjective processes will to a great extent determine the\nnature of international relations at the outset of the\ncoming millennium. They open up enormous opportunities\nand at the same time are fraught with grave challenges.\nSo far, the future does not seem to be bright for some,\nespecially for the least developed, the weak and the\nvulnerable, which could result in an even wider gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, between nations and within\nthem. The increasing interdependence of States and its\neffects are clearly demonstrated by the Asian financial\ncrisis, which spilled over to some other parts of the\nworld, adversely affecting the world economy, exacting\nhigh economic and social costs and raising serious\nconcerns about the operations of financial markets.\nWe believe that the present financial crisis calls for\nthe international community to create a crisis early\nwarning system. Therefore, naturally, these issues are on\nthe minds of peoples and on the agenda of this Assembly.\nWe believe that the high-level meetings held last week in\nthis Assembly will provide a good basis for serious,\nconstructive and fruitful debate and decisions on these\nissues.\nAfter decades of virtual isolation from world\ndevelopment, Mongolia is taking active measures to\nintegrate itself into the global economy on the basis of\nwhatever comparative advantage it has. Though concrete\nsteps have been taken in the past few years, including\nopening up its economy to the outside world and joining\nthe World Trade Organization, the negative consequences\nof globalization, which are felt especially by the weak and\nvulnerable, including by the landlocked developing\ncountries, risk marginalizing it economically, if not\npolitically. We therefore believe that the world\ncommunity, when searching for adequate responses to\nglobalization, should take into account the challenges that\nthese vulnerable States and those in transition are facing\nand take measures to facilitate their adaptation to the\nchanging realities.\n21\n\n\nWe believe that the international community should\npay increasing attention to the situation of landlocked\ndeveloping States. They are handicapped by their\ngeographical location and remoteness from world markets,\nwhich, as experts point out, curtails their annual growth by\n1 to 3 per cent at the very least. It is no wonder that of the\n30 landlocked developing countries, 16 are among the least\ndeveloped, with per capita gross domestic product of less\nthan $400. The progressive marginalization of those\ncountries is evident from the fact that the 300 million\npeople who live in those countries share only 0.5 per cent\nof world trade, with the trend moving towards further\ndecrease.\nLike other landlocked developing countries, Mongolia\nis taking measures to overcome the difficulties inherent to\nlandlocked countries by closely cooperating with itstransit\nneighbours. In this regard, Mongolia is looking forward to\nconcluding a subregional agreement with Russia and China\nthat would facilitate transit transportation for all three\ncountries and the subregion in general.\nBearing in mind the state of the world?s economy and\nthe role that the United Nations could play, Mongolia\nsupports the efforts to increase the role of the United\nNations in economic and social development, especially of\nweak and vulnerable States, and in creating an effective\nmechanism of international cooperation for development.\nLikewise, it is in favour of convening international\nconferences on development financing and on partnership\nfor development.\nMongolia believes that the notion of development\nshould not be limited only to economic growth. In this\nregard, we fully agree with the wider notion that is\nreflected in the human development reports.\nEconomic development, like other human activities, is\ndirectly connected to the state of the world?s\nenvironment \u2014 in fact, with the future of mankind. In\nmany countries, especially those that are environmentally\nvulnerable, the question of protecting the environment is\ndirectly linked to their security and even ultimate survival.\nThe changes in the world climate, its caprices that we see\nand feel, lead us to believe that greater attention and efforts\nare needed to cope with this ever growing and creeping\ndanger, the effects of which are incalculable. Therefore, we\nbelieve that the first International Decade for Natural\nDisaster Reduction should be followed by a second decade\nwith greater focus on reaching the targets set forth, as well\nas strengthening existing mechanisms and creating, where\nnecessary, new international mechanisms.\nMongolia, following its centuries-old tradition of\nliving in harmony with nature and the environment,\ndeclared 15 per cent of its territory \u2014 an area larger than\nCentral Europe \u2014 a protected natural reserve. In the near\nfuture that area will comprise one third of its vast\nterritory.\nPolitical stability is essential for economic\ndevelopment and fruitful cooperation. The end of the cold\nwar was an important milestone in international relations\nthat raises hopes for further strengthening peace and\ndeveloping cooperation among nations. However, the\npost-cold-war years have vividly demonstrated that peace\nand stability need constant efforts by States to deepen\nmutual trust and to settle disputes by political means.\nThough some political flashpoints have been eliminated\nand problems solved, new ones are still arising. As\nreflected in the general debate the situations in the Middle\nEast, in the Balkans and in southern Africa are causing\nconcern on the part of the international community.\nMongolia supports solving those problems on the basis of\nnegotiation, in the spirit of cooperation, without the use\nor threat of force. In this connection, we would like to\nreiterate that the Korean peninsula should be turned into\na zone of peace, stability and prosperity in the interests of\nthe Korean people, as well as the peace and security of\nNorth-East Asia.\nIn another part of the Asian continent, in South Asia,\nthe international community was shocked by nuclear tests\nthat could exacerbate tensions and undermine the existing\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and the test ban.\nMongolia, situated between two nuclear Powers, stands\nstrongly against any nuclear tests and, like other\ncountries, expressed its deep concern and regret over the\nrecent tests. Therefore, we welcome the declaration of the\nPeople?s Republic of China not to resume nuclear tests\nand express the hope that the latest encouraging signals\nfrom Pakistan and India will lead to strengthening the\nnon-proliferation regime and moving closer to the\nobjectives of nuclear disarmament. In this respect,\nMongolia supports the eight-Power Declaration entitled\n\u201cTowards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a\nnew agenda\u201d. Likewise, we express the hope that the\nnegotiations on banning the production of fissile material\nfor nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices\nwill soon lead to the conclusion of a verifiable\ninternational treaty.\nMongolia believes that non-nuclear-weapon States\ncan, in their own way, contribute to strengthening nuclear\nsecurity and enhance stability. In this context, it welcomes\n22\n\n\nand supports the efforts of the Central Asian States to\nestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in their region. For its\npart, Mongolia is working to institutionalize its nuclear-\nweapon-free status, which would turn its territory into an\narea of peace, stability and predictability. All nuclear-\nweapon States, as well as the entire Non-Aligned\nMovement, fully support Mongolia?s efforts to\ninstitutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status.\nMongolia is in favour of strengthening the arms\ncontrol and verification regimes set up by the Conventions\non chemical and biological weapons. They will, in our\nview, given a genuine will to enforce them, strengthen\ninternational security. Likewise, Mongolia supports\ninternational efforts to curb the spread of conventional\nweapons, especially of small arms and light weapons.\nInternational peace and security will be strengthened\nwhen and if international law is strictly observed. We\nbelieve that international law should be strengthened as the\ncore of security relations. In this connection, Mongolia\nwelcomes the recent adoption by the Rome Conference of\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. We are in\nfavour of a truly independent court and look forward to its\nearly establishment and coming into operation. This would\nconstitute an important milestone in strengthening\ninternational law and justice.\nMongolia condemns all acts of international terrorism.\nTherefore, it resolutely condemns the recent terrorist\nbombings in Kenya, Tanzania and Northern Ireland and\nbelieves that international terrorism should be fought by\njoint efforts and in full accordance with the norms and\nprinciples of international law. It believes that acts of\nterrorism should be condemned wherever, by whomever\nand against whomever they are carried out.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights is an event of\nspecial significance. It is connected with the tremendous\nchanges that have taken place over the last half-century in\nthe concept of human rights and the practice of ensuring\nthem.\nThanks to the Declaration, unprecedented high\nstandards have been set for protecting human dignity. Since\nthe adoption of the Declaration in 1948, those standards\nhave been strengthened and further developed by numerous\ninternational treaties and conventions and have become\ntruly universal.\nThe legal foundations reflecting the world standard\nof protection and promotion of human rights were laid\ndown in Mongolia?s 1992 Constitution. Since then it has\nbeen further developed and concretized by relevant\nlegislation and the establishment of the necessary\nadministrative and legal machinery based on United\nNations human rights treaties and conventions to which\nMongolia has acceded. At present preparations are under\nway for the establishment of a national human rights\ncommission. A draft law to that effect has been submitted\nto the Parliament for its consideration and adoption.\nAs it confronts the many global problems before it\nand approaches the new millennium, the world\ncommunity places great hopes in the activities of a strong\nand well-equipped United Nations. In that connection,\nMongolia firmly supports the Secretary-General?s reform\npackage.\nIn implementation of decisions and recommendations\nof United Nations summit conferences on major global\nsocial and economic problems, and in support of the so-\ncalled silent revolution, my Government has adopted a\nnational action programme for the twenty-first century\nand, in close partnership with bodies of the United\nNations family and non-governmental organizations\noperating in Mongolia, is launching an ambitious project:\nthe One-World Conference Series, which is aimed at\nensuring an integrated follow-up to the world conferences\nand summits held in the early 1990s.\nReform of the United Nations cannot be complete\nwithout the reform and expansion of the Security Council.\nIn that connection, I would like to reiterate my\nGovernment?s conviction that the Council should reflect\npolitical realities, and, besides becoming more effective,\nits membership should be enlarged to reflect more\nequitable representation. It is our hope that the General\nAssembly debates on this important issue will soon result\nin concrete decisions. We believe that energetic efforts\nshould be undertaken to make the Millennium Assembly\nan occasion for reforming and revitalizing the Security\nCouncil.\nOn the proposal of Mongolia, the General Assembly\nis drafting a set of guiding principles for conducting\ninternational negotiations. We believe that the\ndevelopment and adoption of such a set of principles\nwould contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of\nnegotiations as the most universal instrument for\ninternational cooperation.\n23\n\n\nMy Government continues to pursue its political and\neconomic reforms. Mongolia?s commitment to the\nirrevocable realization of the principles of democracy,\nliberalism and market economy is irreversible, despite the\ngreat difficulties of the transition period. The future major\npolicy priorities will continue to include, inter alia,\nstrengthening of democratic institutions, enhancement of the\nbasis of political stability, acceleration of privatization in\nthe economic field, and social protection of the population,\nespecially of its vulnerable groups.\nOn behalf of the Mongolian people and its\nGovernment, I take this opportunity to express our deep\ngratitude to the international community, especially donor\ncountries and international financial institutions, for their\nassistance to Mongolia since it joined the community of\nopen societies and democratic nations.\nA century that has been full of dramatic and\nconsequential events is drawing to a close. It has been a\ncentury of great social upheaval and experimentation as\nwell as of unprecedented social progress and technological\nadvances. We believe that a more promising millennium is\nin store for all humankind and that the world community\nwill be able to meet the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. Mongolia stands poised at this historic juncture to\nmake its contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to\nbring about a brighter and more secure future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by congratulating the President on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. His election to this distinguished post\nis a testament to the international community\u2019s\nappreciation of the effective contribution to international\naffairs made by his country, Uruguay, with which the\nSultanate of Oman enjoys good relations of friendship and\ncooperation. We are confident that under his leadership\nand considerable diplomatic experience our deliberations\nhere will be crowned with success. My delegation stands\nready to cooperate with him fully in order to achieve all\nthe aims envisaged by this session.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express sincere\nthanks to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of friendly Ukraine for\nthe exemplary and constructive manner with which he\nsteered the work of the previous session. I would also like\nto confirm my country\u2019s unwavering support for the\nsustained and dedicated work done by the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, to enhance and reinvigorate the\nrole of the United Nations and to restructure its principal\nbodies.\n9\n\n\nIt has now been over half a century since the\nestablishment of the United Nations, during which time it\nhas handled a significant number of international issues.\nHowever, the United Nations often remains unable to\nresolve many regional crises which have erupted since the\nend of the cold war. In spite of the attention paid to these\nissues by the international community, the majority of those\nincluded in our agenda have remained without effective\nsolutions. It is our view that this is due to the failure and\nlack of resolve on the part of Member States to utilize the\nmechanisms of the United Nations which were established\non the basis of the Charter.\nIf this is the case today, how will the future be, when\nwe shall be expected to face more conflicts which may be\ndifferent in nature and size as compared to old conflicts?\nWe cannot address them in the conventional way. We shall\nhave to examine their root causes and address their\nmanifestations and give full support to the Organization in\norder to find the means to develop adequate bases for\naddressing them so as to protect the international\ncommunity against their recurrence.\nThe high-level working group of the General\nAssembly made progress in the area of restructuring and\nstreamlining some of the main organs of the United\nNations, in particular with regard to the question of reform\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council.\nThe setback which the Open-ended Working Group on this\nquestion faced during the previous General Assembly\nsession should not stand in the way of achieving further\nprogress. We should not accept retreat from what has\nalready been accomplished. We have to encourage the\nWorking Group to redouble its efforts to complete the\nscope of the needed reforms of the United Nations in a\nmanner that will meet the aspirations of the international\ncommunity on the basis of comprehensiveness and equality\namong all States, which in turn will contribute balance and\ntransparency to the methods of work of the Security\nCouncil. This will be a contribution to the decision-making\nprocess and to the clarity of vision with regard to the\nemerging developments in our contemporary world in\nwhich justice, security and peace should prevail.\nIn this way, all Member States, large and small, would\nbe enabled to participate in the resolution of international\nproblems, especially those which have a direct impact on\ntheir own interests, in an appropriate and just manner.\nThe greatest danger facing the Members of the United\nNations in the post-cold-war era is represented by some of\nthe unhealthy situations which lead to nearly worldwide\neconomic stagnation and the spread of terrorism and\nethnic wars, as I have just indicated. This would\njeopardize all the achievements made by humankind in\nthe scientific and technological fields, as well as with\nregard to the standards of social and economic\ndevelopment, and would lead to an historic era with\nnegative consequences for the future.\nThe disturbing economic situation in East Asia since\nthe beginning of the financial crisis in the middle of 1997\nhas generated instability and created political and social\nupheavals in the region. In spite of the reform measures\nfor economic stability by the concerned States in Asia,\nwith the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nand the World Bank, the success in restoring stability to\nthe world economy was limited. In fact, we have begun\nto witness the repercussions of those measures on other\neconomies which were previously immune from them.\nThis is due to the fact that the efforts made were not\ncoherent and did not address the urgent need to take a\ncomprehensive view of the whole crisis, within an\nequitable international context.\nThe events that I have outlined emphasize the need\nfor collaborative efforts with a view to the establishment\nof a fair and equitable global economic system that would\ncover all goods, technologies and services. We believe\nthat this should be linked to a new system of international\nfinancial markets which would be more transparent and\nefficient and thus responsive and adaptable to the\nchanging financial conditions in the world markets. While\nI am not in a position to give concrete proposals here, we\ndo feel that this session provides an appropriate\nopportunity for scrutinizing the global economic situation\nand for examining all problems and complications\nworldwide, thereby avoiding more problematic impacts\nfrom which the international community should be saved.\nThis imposes on us the need to work harder, and work\ntogether, to face the challenges before us in order to\nrestore confidence and return stability and normal growth\nto the global economy.\nWe strongly condemn the terrorist bombing attacks\non the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-\nSalaam, as well as the bombing incident in Cape Town,\nSouth Africa. We also deplore the assassination of the\nIranian diplomats in Afghanistan. This wave of\ninternational terrorism and its rapid growth in an ugly and\ndestructive form puts us all in a position of responsibility\nwhere we must work together to secure peace, tranquillity\nand stability, and employ all the measures that are\nnecessary to the success of our endeavours in combating\n10\n\n\nterrorism. We believe that the measures which are now\nnecessary to ensure that the perpetrators of those crimes\nand those who advocate their commission are brought to\njustice under the auspices of the United Nations. In this\nregard, we support the proposal made by the Arab Republic\nof Egypt and endorsed by the twelfth Summit of the Non-\nAligned Movement held at Durban, South Africa, at the\nbeginning of this month, to convene an international\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations in\norder to work out common arrangements that would express\nthe reaction of the international community to the\nphenomenon of terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations.\nWe feel deep regret at the growing situation of famine\namong nations, which points out the inability of those\ncountries to grow their natural resources owing to the\nfailure of the developed countries to understand the real\nneed for helping these people evolve the frameworks\nneeded to operate and activate their national\ninstrumentalities and to benefit from every assistance given\nto them. Since a number of United Nations agencies, such\nas United Nations Development Programme, have become\nunable to continue offering their expertise due to the\nshortage of financial resources, several developing countries\nwere affected to the point that the implementation of\nimportant economic programmes in those countries has\nbeen seriously impeded.\nIn other regions, ethnic conflicts have threatened to\nreturn the human family to the rule of the jungle and the\nlegitimation of minority rule as based on injustice,\noppression and a one-man rule, instead of the resort to\ninternational law, which is based on justice and equality of\nrights and common interests. If we look at the root causes,\nwe find that most of the wealth is controlled by a few\nGovernments. This factor is behind the ethnic, political and\nsocial conflicts which give rise to all forms of violence and\nterrorism.\nOnly 14 months separate us from the next millennium.\nWe had hoped that humankind would celebrate this historic\noccasion in an atmosphere of political and economic\nstability, free from violence, terrorism, poverty and \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d. Thus, we should intensify our efforts to fight\nterrorism and violence in a framework of coordinated\ninternational efforts aimed at eradicating these unsettling\nphenomena, and to ensure that the perpetrators and\nadvocates of such crimes are brought before the courts of\njustice.\nIn this context, the Middle East continues to face a\nvery serious political crisis as a result of the stalemate in\nthe peaceful negotiations between the Arab countries and\nthe Israelis under the sponsorship of the United States of\nAmerica.\nThe political stagnation caused by the Israeli\nGovernment and its non-compliance with the agreements\nthat followed the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference under\nworld sponsorship which led to the historic Oslo accord,\nand other agreements between the Government of Israel\nand the Palestinian National Authority have, in our view,\nthwarted world and regional efforts aimed at the\nrestructuring of the Middle East region on the basis of a\njust and comprehensive peace leading to confidence-\nbuilding and to hope for peaceful coexistence between the\nArabs and the people of Israel.\nWe cannot but wonder where we stand in relation to\nthis goal. The Israeli Government\u2019s plans aim at\ncontrolling the Arab lands occupied since 1967. These\nIsraeli policies have hindered the concerted and\nintensified efforts exerted by the United States as a co-\nsponsor of the peace process. In addition, this has caused\nan atmosphere of suspicion to prevail among the Arab\nStates as regards the genuine desire of the Israeli\nGovernment for peaceful coexistence and cooperation\nwith the Arabs.\nThe United Nations has been continuously discussing\nthis issue since 1948 and has adopted many General\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions. Israel has not\nrespected or implemented any of these resolutions, even\nonce. These resolutions include Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which were\nadopted following the wars of 1967 and 1973. Israel has\nrefused to implement these resolutions through the United\nNations, insisting on unilateral negotiations outside the\nUnited Nations. The Arab countries responded positively\nand seriously to the calls for peace from various States by\nparticipating in the Madrid Peace Conference. The Arab\ncountries have responded fully and positively to building\na society based on peace in the Middle East. Despite all\nof this, the Israeli Government now refuses this proposal\nand continues to occupy and confiscate land in the West\nBank.\nIs it justice that the world daily witnesses the\nexpulsion of Palestinian citizens from their homes, the\ndemolishing of their homes and the confiscation of their\nland? Is it justifiable for us to sit and witness the repeated\nviolation by the Israeli authorities of the rights and\n11\n\n\nintegrity of the Palestinians through the occupation and the\nsiege of their towns and villages? Where is the just peace\nthat we are talking about when the Israeli Government\ncontinues to build new and illegal settlements on Palestinian\nlands, while the Palestinians themselves are being prevented\nfrom building or even repairing their own homes?\nThese measures are nothing but grave injustice. Can\nthe United Nations condone such practices? Can the peace\nsponsors accept that? Where is the respect for human rights\nin the face of this denial of Palestinian rights when we are\ncelebrating this year the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights?\nIt is incumbent on all peace-loving nations which call\nfor the implementation of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights to stand by the Palestinian cause and to\nreject the policies of the Israeli Government, which persists\nin trampling over the dignity of the Palestinian people.\nThe establishment of peace in the Middle East requires\nthe use of every convincing measure in order to make Israel\naccept and implement its legal and international obligations\ntowards the Palestinian Authority, including withdrawal\nfrom the West Bank in accordance with the Oslo,\nWashington and Cairo accords. Israel also must resume\nnegotiations with the Syrian Government from the point\nwhere they ended, with the ultimate goal of signing a peace\ntreaty that will secure the withdrawal of Israeli forces from\nthe occupied Syrian territories to the line of 4 June 1967,\nas well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern\nLebanon and the western Bekaa, in accordance with\nresolutions 425 (1978) and 427 (1978).\nWe believe that these are the necessary conditions for\npeace to prevail in the Middle East. They will also provide\nthe legitimate necessary guarantees for Israel and foster an\natmosphere of confidence among the Arab and the Israeli\npeoples.\nThe Arab countries cannot accept the continued Israeli\npolicy aimed at the Judaization of Arab Jerusalem, and they\nconsider any change in the demographic composition of the\nArab city of Jerusalem and the expansion of Israeli\nsettlements in the occupied Arab territories null and void.\nIn spite of Israel\u2019s intransigence and continued refusal\nto cooperate with the co-sponsors of the peace process in\nthe Middle East to finalize this process and bring it to a\nconclusion, my country, believing in the significance and\ninevitability of peace in this region, declares in this forum\nits full support of the endeavours made by the co-sponsors,\nin particular those of the United States. In this regard, I\nwould like to highlight the commendable role of the\nEuropean Union and its continued economic support for\nthe Palestinian National Authority. I call on the\ninternational community to extend every possible\nassistance to the Palestinian National Authority and its\nvarious educational, health and social institutions that will\nsafeguard what is achieved in the context of this peace\nprocess.\nThe decision by the Arab countries to follow the\ncourse of peace is a strategic option, and they have\ngenuinely worked towards achieving this purpose based\non their belief that for all the peoples of the region,\nincluding Israel, peace is required for prosperity and\nstability. Based on this, the Sultanate of Oman once again\naffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people and\nsupports the position of the Palestinian National Authority\nregarding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the lands\noccupied since 1967, thus allowing the Palestinian\nNational Authority to extend its control to all its lands,\nincluding the Holy City of Jerusalem.\nWe stress the necessity for Iraq to fully implement\nall relevant Security Council resolutions to eliminate its\narsenal of all weapons of mass destruction. Fully\ncognizant of the fact that the United Nations Special\nCommission has not been able to finalize its inspection,\nwe call for persistent efforts to end the hardship borne by\nthe fraternal Iraqi people. By the same token, we call\nupon the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts to find\ncommon ground for cooperation and to build confidence\nbetween the Special Commission and the Iraqi\nGovernment. We also call upon Iraq to cooperate fully\nwith the ad hoc Tripartite Commission mandated to\nfollow up on the issue of the prisoners of war and\nmissing persons, either Kuwaitis or other nationalities,\nand to facilitate their release in order to end this tragedy\nfor their families.\nIn the Gulf region we are witnessing a new era of\npositive cooperation between the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. We\nwelcome this significant development, which will\nencourage us to work in a genuine manner to create a\npropitious climate for enabling the United Arab Emirates\nto exercise its sovereign rights on the islands of Greater\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. Moreover, we should\nbe able to take the relations between the Islamic Republic\nof Iran and the GCC to a new level of cooperation on the\nbasis of the principle of mutual benefit international law.\n12\n\n\nThe efforts exerted in the field of disarmament aim to\nensure international security and stability. My country has\nalways expressed its unqualified support for these efforts.\nWe also emphasize the need for taking practical measures\nto make the Middle East and the Gulf area zones free of\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.\nThe Sultanate of Oman signed the Chemical Weapons\nConvention in 1992 and acceded to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1997. I\nannounce here that my country has decided to sign the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We look\nforward to seeing Israel take part in the efforts to make the\nMiddle East a region free of nuclear weapons and to seeing\nit place all its nuclear facilities under the strict control and\nfull safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nWith regard to the situation in Somalia, my country\nwould like to commend the efforts by Egypt, as well as by\nEthiopia and the neighbouring countries, to reconcile the\nSomalis and to convene a national reconciliation\nconference. We believe such a conference will help the\nSomalis rebuild their State in the national interest of the\nbrotherly Somali people. We call upon the United Nations\nto extend tangible support to these efforts.\nAs the world celebrates in 1998 the fiftieth anniversary\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by\nthe United Nations General Assembly in 1948, the\nSultanate of Oman actively participated in the Diplomatic\nConference to establish the International Criminal Court,\nwhich was held in Rome during June and July. We\nemphasize the need for this newly established Court to\nwork in harmony and complementarity with national\njurisdictions of Member States.\nWe express our deep concern regarding the ongoing\ncivil war in Afghanistan, which has resulted in the total\ndestruction of that country and has intensified the suffering\nof its people. It has also had a serious negative impact on\nthe unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of this\nMuslim nation. We call upon all warring factions in\nAfghanistan to reconcile in a manner that will bring peace\nand stability to the people. In this regard, we would like to\nexpress our support of and appreciation for the initiatives of\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan, headed by the\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi.\nThe successive crises in the African continent have\ndemonstrated the complexity of the political, economic and\nsocial situation therein. Rescuing Africa requires concerted\ninternational efforts to overcome its difficulties. In\nparticular, African countries need international assistance\nto continue the process of reform and economic\ndevelopment. We believe that unified international action\nis necessary more than ever to support the United Nations\ncoordination of efforts of the international donor\norganizations and the efforts on the regional level by the\nOrganization of African Unity and the neighbouring\ncountries in the areas of conflict with a view to promoting\ndevelopment and progress in the African continent.\nThe current situation in Kosovo and the persecution\nand killings of the Albanian Muslims and others in this\nregion have been deplored and denounced by the\ninternational community. We condemn the use of\nterrorism and violence in international relations as a mean\nto resolve political differences. We call for the\ncontainment and just settlement of this crisis.\nWhile realizing the national reasons why India and\nPakistan each carried out its latest nuclear tests, we\ncontinue to call upon the two neighbouring countries to\npromptly sign the NPT and CTBT in order to prevent the\nescalation of the arms race in other regions of the world.\nWe hope that the circumstances will allow them to do so.\nAs the United Nations plays its role to eliminate all\nlethal weapons from this globe, my country would like to\ncommend the international efforts that have led to the\nadoption in December 1997 of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction. This achievement should alleviate the\nsufferings and spare the lives of thousands of innocent\ncivilians who might fall victim to this kind of weapon.\nIn the context of preserving the environment, the\nSultanate of Oman has submitted a proposal to the\nregional organization for the protection of marine life in\nthe Gulf to establish bunkering ports for oil tankers in\norder to protect the territorial waters and preserve the\nmarine life in the region from pollution.\nOn the economic front, the current situation has had\na negative impact on economic growth in Oman, just as\nit has elsewhere in the world. But Oman is determined to\nproceed with its plans for economic diversification and\nharmonization with the regional and international\neconomic environment.\n13\n\n\nOn the national level, Oman has carried out the\npolicies, legislation and other measures conducive to\nforeign investment, based on the principles of a market\neconomy. At the regional level, my country participates\nactively in regional economic gatherings. Within the GCC,\nand thanks to the spirit of partnership among member\nStates and the economic integration legislation, the rates of\ngrowth in the non-oil sectors have substantially increased.\nIn the Indian Ocean Rim Association for regional\ncooperation, my country is an active participant in efforts\nto promote and invigorate economic trade cooperation. In\nthis context, I would like to draw your attention to the\ninvestment by the Sultanate of Oman in infrastructure\nprojects such as the port of Raysut in the southern region\nof Oman, Dhofar. This port will offer services to container\nships and will enhance international maritime trade and\ntransport in our region.\nAt the international level, my country is working\ntowards membership in the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), and we are fully committed to taking the necessary\nsteps to assure our full participation and responsibilities\nwithin that organization.\nThe Sultanate of Oman thus works in a diligent and\ncooperative manner to promote the development of\neconomic relations with other nations and with regional and\ninternational groupings for mutual benefit and the\npromotion of international trade and investment.\nThe Sultanate of Oman stands ready to extend the\nhand of friendship to all peace-loving nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,\non your election, which attests to the high regard in which\nthe international community holds you and your country,\nand which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,\nwelcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session\nof the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead\nto the strengthening of the Organization.\nIt was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, \u201cthe\npeoples of the United Nations\u201d, decided to join our efforts\n\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\nthe dignity and worth of the human person...to\nestablish conditions under which justice...can be\nmaintained, and to promote social progress\u201d.\nThat immense ambition was justified by the recent\nhorrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from\nhappening again \u2014 a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a\nsuperhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert\nCamus put it:\n\u201dSuperhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time\nto accomplish, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nA long time has elapsed, and we are still working on\nthat, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what\nwe have done as the United Nations throughout these 53\nyears, of what the Security Council and successive General\nAssemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-\nGeneral \u2014 in particular the current one over the last two\nyears, whose work has been so outstanding.\nOver the decades, the Security Council, except when\nparalysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed\nto shoulder its primary responsibility for international\nsecurity. When it failed to do so, no other institution was\nable to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50\nyears ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations\nof this kind.\nThe institutional framework established by the\nCharter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from\ncold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,\nproved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne\nout in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when\nthe Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in\nAfrica, during the creation of the United Nations Mission\nin the Central African Republic, which was the first\nentirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and\neven in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted\nto the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its\nobjective.\nAnd yet, as the Secretary-General himself\nemphasized recently,\n\u201cUnpredictability and surprise have become almost\ncommonplace\u201d (A/53/1, para. 1),\nand the illusions of the end of the cold war have not\nstood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge\nthis fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.\nSometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some\nStates take advantage of circumstances and deliberately\ncarry out archaic policies of force that contravene the\nprinciples of the Charter. On other occasions, the\nabdication or implosion of States has released among\nvarious groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very\nmuch alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these\nare destabilizing factors which, while very different, all\nhelp to disorganize and imperil international relations.\nSeveral major crises have proved this recently. The\nAsian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,\nwhen badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world\nthat is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive\nreactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid\nspread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is\nexchanged on the financial markets \u2014 huge sums of\nmoney that are greater than the means of intervention of\nall the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those\namounts were equal to the world\u2019s gross national product.\nToday, they are 15 times greater.\nThe nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic\nreminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute\ncombined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity\ncould open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.\nIn East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of\na border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven\nStates are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory\n15\n\n\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization\nis threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I\ncannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,\ncivil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve\nmore than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.\nTwenty-two million civilians \u2014 displaced persons and\nreturnees \u2014 have been affected by these conflicts and\nrequire assistance from the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active\nin 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;\nslavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;\ndisappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.\nBut I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of\nwoe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which\nis the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very\nmoment trying to maintain peace on four continents with\napproximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17\noperations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20\nagencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.\nNor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in\n1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.\nI wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the\nmultilateral system do not today have the necessary means\nto meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not\ngive up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our\naction?\nAllow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,\nwe can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our\ninstitutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security\nCouncil a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the\ncase of \u201cthreats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and\nacts of aggression\u201d.\nNothing can justify the use of force by a State, a\ngroup of States or an organization, however powerful, if\nprior authorization was not received from the Security\nCouncil \u2014 except in cases of self-defence.\nMy country shares the impatience of those who\ndeplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution\nto various cruel conflicts \u2014 for example, in Kosovo, where\nthe humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November\n1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put\nforward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its\nother partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground\nfor a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for\nthe return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible\nuse of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to\nforgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after\nthis case there would be another exception, and then\nanother. Little by little, any country would declare itself\nentitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or\nambitions so required, and we would have to begin all\nover again. We must remain firm on this principle.\nSecond, we must make sure that the authority of the\nSecurity Council is respected and its resolutions are\ncomplied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today\nthe question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.\nThe lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council\u2019s\nresolutions, been made subject to the controlled\ndismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must\ntherefore meet these conditions \u2014 completely meet them,\nbut only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim\nmust be to reintegrate Iraq into the international\ncommunity, starting with the region.\nThe only way to achieve that end is by Iraq\u2019s\ncomplete compliance with the relevant resolutions \u2014 all\nthe resolutions, nothing but the resolutions \u2014 which\nmeans Iraq\u2019s unreserved cooperation with the United\nNations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq\u2019s\ndisarmament.\nThe third need is to increase the representativeness\nof the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.\nThis is why my country has come out in favour of\nenlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,\nnew permanent members \u2014 two seats for the North, to\nwhich Germany and Japan have every claim, and three\nfor the South; on the other hand, there should be new\nnon-permanent members for the North and South. This\nenlargement must at the same time preserve the Council\u2019s\neffectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its\nresponsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third\nsession of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.\nFourth, we must increase the capacity of our\nOrganization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is\nmuch to be done. Now that the international community\nhas just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth\nanniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the\npeace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in\nMadrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,\nand the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France\ncontinues to support the persevering efforts of the United\nStates Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left\nwithout any prospects at all should those efforts\nunfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac\nand President Mubarak have proposed in that event\nconvening a conference of countries resolved to save the\n16\n\n\npeace. This concern for the future has been very well\nreceived. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working\nto further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of\nmeeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a\njust and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and\nagreements that have been reached.\nAnother region in crisis calls for our attention. As I\nmentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo six or seven African States of the\nGreat Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle\nof problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,\nethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so\nforth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each\nof these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a\nregional solution. That is why my country has raised again\nthe idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes\nregion, which we suggested as early as 1995. The\nconference would be placed under the aegis of the United\nNations or the Organization of African Unity, with the\nactive participation of the States of the region. Several\nAfrican diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We\nsupport those efforts.\nAfrica is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us\npay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nrepresentatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of\nMatre Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.\nFifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral\ndisarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the\nnuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone\nrecognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime\nand pursue the disarmament process in all areas \u2014 nuclear,\nconventional, chemical and biological.\nOur primary objective here should be the entry into\nforce as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United\nKingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the\nTreaty and is the only one to have completed the\ndismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that\nhave not yet done so to accede to this Treaty \u2014 including\nIndia and Pakistan, which have announced their intention\nnot to carry out any more nuclear tests.\nAnother objective here would be a treaty banning the\nproduction of fissile material for military purposes. I\nproposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of\nthe Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we\nshould launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-\ndiscriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give\nnew impetus to disarmament.\nWe should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of\nchemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the\nConvention banning chemical weapons becomes universal\nand that the Convention banning biological weapons is\nmade truly effective through a verification mechanism.\nCombating the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles\ncapable of delivering such weapons, while preserving\nuseful civilian applications.\nIn order to make progress in conventional\ndisarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention\nproviding for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel\nmines comes into force as soon as possible.\nSixth, we should continue to combat\nunderdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no\nfurther demonstration. France remains heavily committed;\nit is the second largest provider of official development\nassistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more\neffective, France has decided to reform its cooperation\narrangements and increase coordination with other donors\n\u2014 in the first place with the European Union. More than\n60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European\nUnion. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin\nAmerica and the second largest to Asia.\nFrance would like development resources to be more\npredictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals\nthat we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the\nidea of a development account. We encourage the United\nNations to continue its discussions in this area.\nSeventh, we need to work with the non-\ngovernmental organizations. They are capable of sounding\nthe alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very\npractical terms to help build States governed by the rule\nof law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the\nactivities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission\non Human Rights and in the various United Nations\nagencies, which must also \u2014 all of them \u2014 integrate the\nhuman rights dimension into their activities.\nAfter more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will\nsee the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of\nhuman rights. This is a crucial text because these are the\nrights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.\n17\n\n\nHowever, even if we reinforce the Security Council,\nstrengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better\nhandle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this\nwill still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and\nfor that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide\nregulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.\nThe eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in\nall its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International\nCriminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive\nnegotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against\nthe impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of\nthe first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential\nsynthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and\nstrikes a balance between the Court\u2019s competences and the\npowers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the\nspirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those\ncountries that still have reservations will be able to join us.\nIn another field of law, the International Labour\nOrganization has taken a historic step towards universal\ncompliance with basic labour standards through the\ndeclaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is\na commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the\nOrganization.\nOn 11 November 1997 the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted\nthe Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and\nHuman Rights. This is the first normative framework to\nguide the international community in an area of scientific\nresearch where advances are already shaking our traditional\nconcepts of life and social organization. France is\nsubmitting a draft resolution calling on the General\nAssembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.\nNinth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of\norganized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of\nillegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion \u2014 8\nper cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the\nInternational Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations\nrepresent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross\ndomestic product.\nAt the special session in New York in June we\ndecided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for\ndrugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let\nus do so.\nTenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,\nwhoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.\nThe recent International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step\nforward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the\nmeans to hunt down those who finance and instigate these\nattacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal\nconvention against the financing of terrorism.\nWe need to define concrete mechanisms for legal\nmeasures and mutual judicial assistance against those who\nfinance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure\nor the freezing of the assets of organizations or\nindividuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be\nprovided for. Innovative measures, such as making it\nimpossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies\ninvestigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we\nhave the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at\nthe end of the present session of the General Assembly.\nPresident Clinton spoke here on Monday of this\ncommon struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.\nIn addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that\nbreed terrorism.\nThe eleventh point I would like to make concerns\nthe remedy for not only the current financial crises, but\nalso the malfunctioning of the international financial\nsystem as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the\nincreasing calls for a \u201cnew Bretton Woods\u201d. Financial\nglobalization is running wild now. New means urgently\nneed to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to\nmake its contribution. We need also to define new rules\nadapted to today\u2019s financial realities. My country is today\npresenting to its European partners some proposals to\ncounter international financial instability.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) must\nnaturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be\nmore legitimate and more effective, working on the basis\nof clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,\ncooperating with other competent bodies, organizing\ndialogue between industrialized countries and emerging\ncountries, ensuring the transparency of the financial\nsystem and reflecting the economic, social and political\nrealities of partner countries \u2014 an IMF that can detect\nearly warning signs to prevent crises from happening.\nWithin this transformation, to which the Director-\nGeneral of the IMF is making an important contribution,\nand also in order better to stabilize the international\neconomic and monetary situation and to support world\ngrowth, Europe will play an increasingly important role\n18\n\n\nsince it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,\nthe euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.\nFrom this period we are living through, which is so\nfull of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and\nof crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular\nthose made under the aegis of the United Nations,\nadditional progress must be forthcoming in building a more\njust and more peaceful world, because this is what we all\nwant.\nToday\u2019s world needs rules. The United Nations must\nremain the unifying framework, and the Charter must\nremain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its\nworth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of\nregulation \u2014 these are three main areas for our work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,I wish to\ncongratulate you on your well-deserved election to preside\nover this session of the General Assembly. It is taking place\nat a time of profound change and disturbing economic and\npolitical developments in various parts of the world. Your\nresponsibilities are correspondingly imposing. I am\nconfident that your accomplishments will be similarly\nsignificant.\nPakistan also wishes to convey its sincere appreciation\nto your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for the skilful and\nproductive manner in which he guided the Assembly?s work\nover the past year.\nAs we seek to build the structures for peace and\nprosperity on the eve of a new millennium, the United\nNations has become even more indispensable. In an\nincreasingly interdependent world, the United Nations is the\nonly organization where nations can come together and\nevolve decisions democratically on critical social and\npolitical issues which affect all peoples. Pakistan has\nprofound faith in the purposes and the promise of the\nUnited Nations.\nI wish to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has moved to revive the United\nNations with bold reforms. These reforms must reinforce\nthe democratic ethos of the United Nations, especially in\nthe Security Council, where the endeavour of some is to\ncreate new centres of privilege rather than eliminate old\ninequalities. The reform we pursue must be inspired by the\nnoble vision of the United Nations Charter: social justice,\nuniversal prosperity and global peace and security. To do\nanything else is to do less than history demands of us.\nWe are living in times of change and promise. The\ndays of global confrontation are gone and doctrines of\ncontainment have lost relevance. The information and\ntechnological revolutions have brought about a phenomenal\ninteraction among the peoples of the world. The global\nvillage is a reality. Today, the prosperity of one region\nsupplements and supports that of another. The creed of our\ntimes must be partnership for peace and development. It\nwill be an irony if the new vision and possibilities are lost\nbecause of narrow prejudices and interests.\nThe world is also pervaded with a deep sense of\nforeboding. We are being propelled into a future which\nappears anarchic and insecure. In recent months, the\ntriumphal hopes for the spread of free markets,\ndemocratic freedoms and world peace have suffered\nsobering setbacks. The crisis spreading from the erstwhile\neconomic dynamo of East Asia has shaken confidence in\nthe prescriptions of trade and financial liberalization. With\nfalling incomes and failing hopes, strife has spread among\nand within nations in virtually every part of the world.\nThis will negate the emerging prospects for ending\nhunger, disease and ignorance universally.\nNew conflicts have appeared, while many old\nproblems persist. The people of Kashmir and Palestine\ncontinue to suffer. Bosnia has seen a brutal war, and now\nKosovo dreads the same fate. Internecine wars have\nscarred Africa. Afghanistan has yet to recover from the\nravages of conflict. Peace has remained elusive in the\nMiddle East. Tensions have been heightened in South\nAsia. There is increasing resort to the unilateral use of\nforce and arbitrary actions against weaker nations. The\nmultiple conflicts and suffering around the world have\nplaced extraordinary demands on the United Nations.\nWe are pained by the continuing tragedy of\nPalestine. The promise of peace has turned to despair and\ndesperation. Peace cannot be achieved without the\nrealization of the right of self-determination and statehood\nof the Palestinian people.\nSeventeen years of war have completely destroyed\nAfghanistan \u2014 its economy, society and polity. Pakistan\nhas, more than any other country, borne the consequences\nof Afghanistan?s turmoil and suffering. We have a vital\ninterest in the restoration of peace and stability in\nAfghanistan.\nPakistan is deeply concerned at the current tensions\nbetween Iran and Afghanistan. We will continue to do all\nwe can to promote peaceful and friendly relations\nbetween these two fraternal neighbours. Those responsible\nfor the outrageous killing of the personnel seized from the\nIranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif must be apprehended\nand punished. We call for the release of all remaining\nIranian personnel and other prisoners held by the parties\nto the Afghan conflict. We support a United Nations and\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) fact-finding\nmission to Afghanistan.\nWe urge reconciliation within Afghanistan through\nrealistic compromise and mutual accommodation. We call\nfor international engagement and dialogue with\n12\n\n\nAfghanistan to promote the objectives of humanitarianism,\nhuman rights and peace. We ask for respect for the\ncountry?s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and\nobservance of the principles of non-interference and non-\nuse of force.\nThis year the nuclear cloud has cast its dark shadow\nover South Asia. When India conducted its first explosion\nin 1974, the reaction of the major Powers was to impose\nrestraints against Pakistan. We felt compelled to acquire a\nmatching capability. Yet, even after we had done so,\nPakistan continued to promote a nuclear-weapons-free zone,\nconventional arms restraint and a zero-missile zone in\nSouth Asia. India rejected all these initiatives.\nIndia?s nuclear tests in May should not have come as\na surprise to the world. We had warned the world several\nweeks before the tests. Even after India conducted its tests,\nthe response of the major Powers was weak and ambiguous.\nOnce again, greater energy was devoted to restraining\nPakistan than in responding to India.\nImmediately after its nuclear tests, India?s leaders\nadopted a belligerent posture towards Pakistan. They told\nus that the geostrategic balance had changed and that\nPakistan should abandon its principled support for Kashmiri\nself-determination. Pakistan faced the threat of force. We\nfelt compelled to convince India that any military\naggression against Pakistan would have the most disastrous\nconsequences.\nThe world must appreciate that Pakistan did not\ninitiate these tests. India tested to alter the strategic balance\nand threatened our security and sovereignty. We waited for\n17 days for the world to respond. We knew that no country\ncould provide us security assurances against a nuclear India.\nThus circumstances forced us to test and establish nuclear\ndeterrence in self-defence. We have violated no\ninternational norm. Regrettably, some friendly countries\nhave imposed sanctions and other restrictions against\nPakistan. These are unjust. I ask the international\ncommunity to determine who is in the wrong and why\nPakistan should be subjected to punitive measures.\nPakistan?s nuclear tests were conducted not to\nchallenge the existing non-proliferation regime, nor to fulfil\nany great power ambition; they were designed to prevent\nthe threat or use of force against Pakistan. Our tests, in\nresponse to those of India, thus served the cause of peace\nand stability in our region.\nWe are not insensitive to the concerns aroused by the\nSouth Asian nuclear tests. Despite the transformed strategic\nsituation, we remain opposed to an arms race, nuclear or\nconventional. We have announced a unilateral moratorium\non testing. We are prepared to strengthen peace and\nstability in the region by mutually agreed measures to\navoid a war, to create a regime for nuclear restraint and\nconventional balance and to promote solutions to the\nunderlying causes of conflict, in particular the Kashmir\ndispute.\nWe will discuss these issues with India when our\ndialogue commences. We are also engaged in a dialogue\nwith several friendly countries to advance these\nobjectives. Pakistan has never contributed to nuclear\nproliferation. We will continue to adhere strictly to our\npolicy of not exporting sensitive technologies and\nequipment.\nPakistan consistently supported the conclusion of a\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) for over\n30 years. We voted for the Treaty when it was adopted\nby the General Assembly in 1996. We have declared a\nmoratorium on further testing; so has India. There is no\nreason why the two countries cannot adhere to the CTBT.\nIn a nuclearized South Asia, the CTBT would have\nrelevance if Pakistan and India were both parties to the\nTreaty. The Non-Aligned Summit has called for universal\nadherence to the CTBT, especially by the nuclear-weapon\nStates. This demand is consistent with the Treaty?s\nrequirement that all nuclear-capable States, including\nIndia, must adhere to the CTBT before it can come into\nforce. Pakistan will oppose any attempt to change this\nfundamental requirement at the conference of States\nparties to the Treaty, scheduled to be held in September\n1999. Such a change can be made only by consensus.\nPakistan is therefore prepared to adhere to the CTBT\nbefore that conference takes place. However, Pakistan?s\nadherence to the Treaty will take place only in conditions\nfree from coercion or pressure.\nIn this regard, we expect that the arbitrary\nrestrictions imposed on Pakistan by multilateral\ninstitutions will be speedily removed. We also expect\ndiscriminatory sanctions against Pakistan to be lifted. And\nwe count on the full support of the world community for\na just resolution of the Kashmir dispute.\nOn the nuclear issue, Pakistan will insist on the\nprinciple of equal treatment with India, whether in terms\nof status or any kind of incentives. It must also be well\nunderstood that if India should resume nuclear testing,\nPakistan will review its position and, if we have adhered\nto the CTBT, invoke the supreme interests clause as\nprovided for under article IX of the Treaty.\n13\n\n\nNuclear deterrence between Pakistan and India will\nremain fragile and dangerous as long as there is a growing\nimbalance in conventional forces. This needs to be\nredressed. Above all, durable peace between Pakistan and\nIndia and restraint in their military postures will be, as\nalways, critically dependent on the resolution of the\nKashmir dispute, which has been the root cause of all\nconflicts and tensions between Pakistan and India.\nWe welcome the recognition in the Secretary-\nGeneral?s annual report that the\n\u201crising tension between India and Pakistan over\nKashmir and other issues is ... a major cause of\nconcern\u201d (A/53/1, para. 18).\nFor almost 50 years, the people of Kashmir have continued\nto await the exercise of the right of self-determination, as\nstipulated in the Security Council?s resolutions. India is\nobliged to allow the plebiscite prescribed in those United\nNations resolutions. India has, however, failed to honour its\ncommitments and resorted instead to a policy based on\nforce to deny the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people.\nTen years ago, Kashmir?s freedom struggle entered a\nnew phase when Indian forces fired on peaceful Kashmiri\ndemonstrators, killing over 100. Kashmir is now occupied\nby a force of 650,000 Indian troops. Over 60,000 Kashmiris\nhave been killed and thousands maimed and arrested.\nCustodial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and\nsummary executions continue to be daily occurrences. The\nnightmare of the Kashmiri people continues. This year,\nmoreover, scores of innocent Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir\nhave been killed and hundreds injured by intensified Indian\nartillery and mortar fire. Even as I speak, tensions are high\non the line of control.\nMy Government is committed to resolving our\nproblem with India through dialogue. This is all the more\nimportant in a nuclear environment in which neither side\nhas the luxury to contemplate the use of force. In June\n1997, we agreed with India on an eight-item agenda and a\nmechanism for the dialogue. Unfortunately, the dialogue\nwas interrupted due to differences over modalities. I am,\nhowever, happy to say that in a meeting which concluded\na short while ago, Prime Minister Vajpayee and I reached\nan agreement to resume the dialogue with the\ncommencement of talks at the Foreign Secretary level,\nwhich will address at the outset the primary issues of peace\nand security and Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe United Nations, the major Powers and the\ninternational community have a responsibility to support\nand facilitate a solution to the Kashmir issue. We request\nthe Secretary-General to take appropriate initiatives to\nimplement Security Council resolutions on Kashmir and\nto ease tensions and build confidence. In particular, we\nurge that the United Nations Military Observer Group in\nIndia and Pakistan be strengthened and its mandate\nenhanced. The Security Council should regularly monitor\nthe volatile situation along the line of control in Jammu\nand Kashmir.\nUntil last year, globalization of the world economy\npromised the spread of prosperity. Today, 30 per cent of\nthe world economy is in recession; by next year, this\nfigure is projected to double. Across East Asia, currencies\nhave drastically depreciated, economies have contracted,\nincomes have plummeted and unemployment has risen,\ndespite sound economic fundamentals.\nAs the East Asian crisis spreads, questions are being\nposed about the economic wisdom of rapid financial and\ntrade liberalization and the social implications of\nglobalization. Yet, in the age of the information and\ncommunications revolution, globalization cannot be\nreversed; it can only be effectively governed.\nThe world community must adopt a coherent\napproach to the current crisis. In the short term, it is\nessential to spur economic growth in all parts of the\nworld. The international financial institutions must relax\ntheir unrealistic conditionalities to prevent any further\ncontraction of the economies of the developing countries.\nMechanisms need to be devised to direct greater\ndevelopment finance to the underdeveloped countries\nwhich have the largest latent demand. Meanwhile,\nmarkets, especially those of the industrial countries, must\nbe kept open. New protectionism in the guise of concern\nfor environmental or labour standards must be resisted.\nIn order to address these issues effectively, we have\nto proceed from three basic premises. First, decisions on\nways to manage globalization must be made collectively\nby all nations. Secondly, specific policies must flow from\nthe overriding objective of ensuring growth with equity:\nequity is not only a moral imperative, it is now a\nprerequisite for sustained global growth. Thirdly, the\nNorth and South must act together: prosperity for both is\ninterlinked.\nThis suggests the need for concerted action by the\ninternational community, which should include, first, the\n14\n\n\nstrengthening of the capacity of multilateral institutions to\naddress the issues of trade, finance and development in an\nintegrated and coherent manner, thereby ensuring the\neffective governance of globalization. In this context, a\nglobal monetary conference to address the old and new\nproblems of the international finance system is now a\nnecessity and should be convened urgently by the United\nNations. Secondly, this action should include correcting the\ninequities in the international trade regime, especially by\nmore rapid liberalization in areas of primary interest to\ndeveloping countries. And finally, it should include\nresolution of the long-standing issues of debt, development\nfinance and access to technology.\nWhat is required today is a realization that there is\nunity in the struggle of the South and the North for\neconomic and social development. A new concept of a\nglobal community appears to be essential: a community\nwhere all human beings are acknowledged as being entitled\nto a life of dignity and to the right to development.\nThe concept of the ummah, or community, in Islamic\nthought offers a model for the realization of such a global\ncommunity. This concept gives primacy to solidarity among\nhuman beings and to equitable benefits to all members of\nthe community. Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance;\nit is inherently moderate and progressive. Here, I would\nlike to warmly welcome President Clinton's vision\naffirming America?s deep respect for Islam and rejecting\nthe pernicious thesis of a clash of civilizations. We must\nwork together to create greater understanding and harmony\namong all religions and peoples of the world.\nThe present drift towards an uncertain and dangerous\nworld must be arrested. Inequality, conflicts and abuse of\nhuman rights are not the inevitable consequences of\nimpersonal forces of history. They are the outcome of our\nown actions. It is in our power to fashion a more equitable\nand more peaceful world. We can do so if we rededicate\nourselves to the ideals of the United Nations Charter. Only\nthen can we ensure that the next century will dawn on a\nprosperous and peaceful world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, on behalf of the delegation of Mali,\nto extend to Mr. Didier Opertti my very warm\ncongratulations on his outstanding election to guide the\nwork of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nTo ensure the success of the lofty mission entrusted to\nhim, I wish to assure him that he will have the full and\nopen cooperation of my country\u2019s delegation. I would also\nlike to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session, for the skill and ability with which he\nguided our work at a time when the reform of the United\nNations occupied a prominent place on the agenda of our\nOrganization.\nI also take this opportunity to convey to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan and his team all our gratitude for\ntheir tireless commitment in the service of the ideals of\nthe United Nations. The delegation of Mali fully\nappreciates his programme of reforms designed to adapt\nour Organization to the changing realities of the world.\nThe fifty-third session of the General Assembly has\nopened at a time when the growing impoverishment of\n13\n\n\nthe poorest countries, the resurgence of hotbeds of tension\nand the difficulties incumbent in a stronger and more united\ncooperation are demonstrating that the rhythm of\ninternational change is unprecedented and requires our\nOrganization\u2019s attention.\nIndeed, it would now appear that increased\ninterdependence and the globalization of the economy are\ncontributing heavily to the rise of new tensions and creating\nprofound imbalances for the developing countries. The\nentire world, under the yoke of the logic of extreme\ncompetition, is going through a phase of profound\nconfusion. Everywhere, North and South, workers live\nunder the remorseless threat of market rules, which grow\nmurkier and more pitiless every day. Financial crises are\nlikely to undermine the developing countries\u2019 efforts at\neconomic reform.\nThe imbalance between North and South is being\nexacerbated, the gaps are widening and differences\nbecoming entrenched. Characterized by a disparity in\nincome, access to services and the possibility of living in\ndignity, poverty is growing in the developing countries and\neven spreading within the developed world.\nMy delegation certainly believes that, if genuine social\ndevelopment and poverty reduction are to be achieved,\nstrong economic growth is necessary and that the poorest\ncountries must have access to markets in order to better\nparticipate, on a sustainable basis, in the world economy. In\nthis respect, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s suggestion\nthat the developing countries be encouraged to participate\nmore actively in the drafting of new international standards\nand in ensuring that these standards be transparent.\nSpecifically, non-tariff barriers should be eliminated for\nAfrican and the least developed countries; vigorous\nmeasures should be adopted to ease the debt burden,\nwhether by converting the public debt of the poorest\ncountries into grants or by easing access to the Debt\nInitiative for the heavily indebted poor countries.\nBut let us make no mistake: what is truly at stake\ntoday is a globalization focused on sustainable human\ndevelopment. The challenge at the end of this century and\ninto the twenty-first will be to close the gap between North\nand South.\nIn this respect, as the highest authorities have said; we\nare convinced that the history of humanity is the history of\nmen. Our constant quest for man is our roadmap for the\nworld\u2019s progress. Our struggle will always be against a\nblind global market and in favour of sharing and solidarity.\nLet us have economic growth, by all means, but let our\nwork and its fruit be shared so as to end these\ninequalities. Let us not close our eyes: Where there is\ninjustice and iniquity, there is no peace.\nRespect for human and national rights is an integral\nfactor for economic prosperity and social equity, as well\nas for promoting and maintaining peace and security. We\ncan achieve such respect and right such imbalances if,\nthrough a renewed political dialogue undertaken in all\nresponsibility and candour, we tackle the challenges with\nglobal vision and solidarity, in the conviction of true\npartnership and shared and equal responsibility in the\nbuilding of a better world, a world of humanity.\nIn this context, the major challenge facing the\nGovernment of Mali today is achieving sustainable human\ndevelopment through the struggle against poverty. This\ndevelopment hinges on a strengthened process of\ndemocratization, the rule of law and the implementation\nof decentralization, the vehicle for local development,\ndesigned and guided by the people.\nMali is rigorously pursuing a freely agreed policy of\neconomic reform and entrenching its democracy. The\npositive results of these efforts, though fragile, are very\nencouraging, but there remain problems and difficulties\nwhich our programmes \u2014 howsoever participatory \u2014\nwill require major outside assistance, peace and stability\nin our subregion, Africa and the world to solve. The same\nholds true for many countries, especially in Africa, which,\nthrough the courageous reforms they have undertaken, are\nonce again on the road to economic growth.\nLike them, we intend to continue and consolidate our\neconomic reforms with strong growth aimed at poverty\nreduction. The international community, however, must\nreverse the trend towards decreased official development\nassistance, which is essential to our basic minimum needs.\nWe pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the United\nNations system and our development partners and urge an\nincrease in official development assistance, without which\nwe will scarcely enjoy the benefits of our reforms,\nundertaken with so much sacrifice in the fight against\npoverty.\nWe also need a partnership aimed at strengthening\nour economic capacities to convert and market our\ncommodities, facilitating their access to markets,\npromoting the resurgence of our private sectors and\nincreasing flows of direct foreign investments. All this\nmust take place in a more favourable economic\n14\n\n\nenvironment if unemployment and poverty are to be\nconsistently reduced.\nThe end of the cold war transformed the international\ncontext for United Nations missions and activities. In the\nsphere of international peace and security, our Organization\nis now taken up with domestic conflicts that often have\nserious international repercussions. Unfortunately, in many\ncases, recent events allow us to assume that this type of\nconflict will continue to claim our attention.\nNow that certain guiding principles in the area of\npeace and security are widely accepted, it is quite obvious\nthat peacekeeping will remain our priority objective. It is\ntherefore essential that we improve our preventive system\nand strengthen our institution\u2019s capacity to organize and\nlead these operations efficiently and successfully.\nFor its part, Mali will always fight for more peace,\njustice and solidarity throughout the world. For us, security\nand development are indissoluble. The grave crises shaking\nthe world, and Africa in particular, strengthen our\nconviction that the United Nations, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the subregional organizations\nmust cooperate closely with one another in the search for\neffective early warning, conflict prevention and\nmanagement, and peacekeeping mechanisms. In this\nframework, and with particular reference to Africa, the\nprevention of conflicts and disarmament are of great\nconcern.\nGiven all of the challenges of democracy, development\nand security that Africa must meet, President Alpha Oumar\nKonar\u00e9 of the Republic of Mali said a few weeks ago that:\n\u201cThe development of the continent must be\nmanaged on new terms. The difficult situation of our\ncontinent has arisen almost everywhere as a result of\ndemocratic failures, which we must redress in our\nyoung and fragile democracies by an essential\ndemocratic commitment. We must promote pluralistic\nexpression, the transfer of power and dialogue founded\non law. We must eschew violence.\n\u201cThe future of our continent does not lie in the\nemergence of ethnic republics, which will only lead us\ninto general anarchy. It is important, we feel, not to\ndeny, much less crush expressions of autonomy. They\nmust be managed politically in a democratic context\nof the basic transfer of power and the emergence of\nlocal power with a view towards regional integration.\n\u201cThirty-eight years after the independence won\nin 1960, there is no question of redrawing the\nborders inherited from colonialism, but nothing\ntoday can justify border conflicts. We must be able\nto settle all border disputes politically. It is essential\ntoday that any ill-defined border be corrected in\nserenity, not in the heat of tension. The OAU\u2019s\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\nand Resolution should be able to speed that forward.\n\u201cAt a time when everyone is welcoming\nintegration, borders must have a different meaning.\nThey must be managed as border countries, joint\nareas and shared space.\u201d\nPresident Konar\u00e9 also said that:\n\u201cPost-election periods are also increasingly\nbecoming times of conflict. This must be prevented\nby the proper preparation for elections, because\nsome recent incidents of electoral challenge have\nthreatened democracy. People must know that the\nonly access to power is through the ballot box,\nwhence all legitimacy flows. Everyone must\nparticipate.\n\u201cWe must therefore seek to control electoral\nchallenges without ever endangering pluralistic\nexpression and the transfer of power. Strength must\nalways reside in law and right \u2014 the whole law and\nright and nothing but law and right \u2014 and oppose\nany impulse to disorder and violence.\u201d\nIn the view of the President of the Republic of Mali,\n\u201cAfrica can no longer be managed as it has been\nsince 1960. A new Africa is on the move, an Africa\nwhich wishes to define its future and take\nresponsibility for its own development; which is\nsearching for solidarity, not alms; which is\nresponsible and confident. It is an Africa once and\nfor all on its own feet, a democratic Africa.\u201d\nThat Africa more than ever needs security and peace. To\nhave that security and peace, Africa must, like the rest of\nthe world, be free from weapons of mass destruction and\nconventional weapons, particularly light weapons.\nWith regard to disarmament, Mali hails the decisions\nof the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT), in particular on the Treaty\u2019s permanent extension.\n15\n\n\nWe also hail the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of the\nChemical Weapons Convention and the progress in\nnegotiations regarding the Biological Weapons Convention.\nWe warmly welcome the coming entry into force of the\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines. Mali, which\nratified this Convention early on, began last May destroying\nits stocks, which Mali\u2019s army had never used.\nWhile welcoming also the notable progress made on\ninstruments regarding weapons of mass destruction, Mali is\ndeeply concerned about conventional weapons, which\nremain an area so far unexplored and not subject to\ninternational norms. Recent conflicts, particularly in Africa,\nwhich have claimed so many human lives, are fuelled not\nby weapons of mass destruction, but by light weapons. That\nis why my country, together with the United Nations and\nthe countries of the West African subregion, has undertaken\nspecific initiatives to counter this phenomenon.\nWe are pleased by the welcome given to President\nKonar\u00e9\u2019s initiative regarding the moratorium on the import,\nexport and production of light weapons by the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), and more\nrecently by the Organization of African Unity during the\nOuagadougou summit and by the Non-Aligned Movement\nat the Durban summit. But it is important now to go further\nto reduce and contain the threat of the proliferation of light\nweapons. This moratorium is in essence a confidence-\nbuilding measure, aiming over the long term to strengthen\nthe ability of the Governments involved to exert stricter\ncontrol over the illegal traffic in light weapons.\nHere we wish to pay tribute to the far-sightedness and\nresponsible commitment of the ECOWAS countries, which\nplan to announce a moratorium soon. This will be a\nprecedent demonstrating Africa\u2019s clear will to prevent\nconflicts by exerting pressure on the means which incite\nand fuel them. The international community must keep up\nthe momentum by mobilizing around the issue of light\nweapons, supporting the moratorium and making it effective\nby implementing a programme of coordination and\nassistance for security and development, which underpin the\nmoratorium and help to widen it.\nWe are an active party, and we support the proposals\nthat emerge daily for tracking the illegal traffic in light\nweapons and establishing a control mechanism. Although\nit is a complex and difficult matter, we must work together\nenergetically to perfect such a mechanism.\nThere must be more support for resolution 52/38 C,\nregarding assistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic\nin small arms and collecting them, and States must\ndemand more on this issue of the international community\nand the United Nations, which we congratulate on the\naction already taken. We must show our commitment to\nmake vigorous progress in creating a mechanism to curb\nthis matter and, at the same time, actively support\ninitiatives such as the moratorium, consciousness-raising\nand the mobilization of all State and non-State actors to\nbetter ensure peace and reduce the threat posed by this\nillegal proliferation to people, particularly women and\nchildren, and to States and democracy.\nOn behalf of the delegation of Mali, I would like\nonce again to voice our solidarity with and compassion\nfor all the peoples of the world who are still living in\nconflict situations.\nRegarding the Middle East, we are deeply concerned\nover the deadlock in the peace process and the policy of\nfait accompli aimed at changing the religious, civil and\nhistoric character of the Holy City of Al-Quds. The\nagreements concluded on the basis of \u201cland for peace\u201d\nmust be implemented. We reaffirm our unswerving\nsupport for the just struggle of the fraternal Palestinian\npeople to realize their legitimate right to self-\ndetermination and to establish an independent State.\nWe remain convinced that in Angola scrupulous\nrespect for the Lusaka Protocol is the only path to lasting\npeace and reconciliation. I wish once again to honour the\nmemory of Matre Alioune Blondin Beye, Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, and the seven\nmembers of his team who tragically perished on the road\nto peace in Angola.\nWe have continually voiced our grave concern about\nthe suffering of the fraternal people of the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya as a result of the embargo imposed on it.\nWhile noting recent events, we should like to recall the\ndecision taken by the heads of State or Government of the\nOAU at their recent summit and to reaffirm that the time\nhas come to end the suffering of the fraternal Libyan\npeople by lifting the embargo and finding a lasting\nsolution.\nConcerned about acts of terrorism, which we\ncondemn in all its forms, Mali firmly condemned the\nlethal attacks against diplomatic missions of the United\nStates in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi. We reiterate our\ncondolences to the families of the victims and call for\ngreater international cooperation to prevent and combat\nthis threat. We also call for the convening of an\n16\n\n\ninternational conference on terrorism under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations, whose exclusive competence in the area of\ninternational peace and security we need increasingly to\nreaffirm.\nI would like to conclude on the issue of the expansion\nof the Security Council. Clearly this body, which was\nconceived in a context quite different from today\u2019s, cannot\nbe left untouched in the course of reform. My delegation\nendorses the demands of Africa for democratization and an\nequitable distribution of the two categories of seats,\npermanent and non-permanent, with all the prerogatives and\npowers that go with them.\nWe are convinced that a restructured United Nations,\ndemocratic and given essential powers, can help ensure a\nmore orderly management of world affairs by eliminating\nthe injustices, disparities and selfishness which threaten\nmankind, so that nations can finally, in a spirit of solidarity,\ndevote their resources and their energy to the progress and\ndevelopment of mankind.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "His illustrious election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session gives me the\npleasant opportunity to express to Mr. Opertti, on behalf of\nthe people and Government of the Niger, our warmest\ncongratulations. His unanimous election is assuredly a\nlegitimate confirmation both of his personal merits and of\nthe firm commitment of his country, Uruguay, to the\ntriumph of our Organization?s noble ideals.\nThese congratulations I extend to the other members\nof the Bureau who help the President in his task, in the\nachievement of whose success I can guarantee the full\ncooperation of the delegation of Niger.\nI would also like to express my sincere compliments\nto the President?s predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nfor his invaluable work as President.\nTo Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, I am happy to repeat here the full support\nof the Government of Niger for his remarkable activities\nin the service of world peace and the courageous reform\nwork he is doing in order to allow the United Nations to\nbetter respond to the challenges of the coming new\nmillennium. I cannot fail to pay tribute to his outstanding\nsuccess in finding, through determination and courage, a\ndiplomatic way out of the Iraq crisis at the beginning of\nthis year, thus greatly contributing to the safeguarding of\npeace and security in the region and thus to enhancing the\ncredibility and the prestige of our Organization, as well as\nto the strengthening of his personal commitment and his\nauthority.\nFor more than a half century the United Nations has\ncarried out one of its main missions by saving us from a\nthird world conflict, which certainly would have been\nfatal to humankind. The end of the cold war brought hope\nof the emergence of a new international order based on\ntotal respect for the principles laid down in the United\nNations Charter and international law, even if that hope\nneeds further strengthening, in particular because of the\npersistence of violent and murderous conflicts, the\nincrease of tensions of all kinds and the accumulation of\nincreasingly destructive weapons by a growing number of\nnations.\nAfrica remains the region of the globe most affected\nby conflicts \u2014 repeated, disturbing conflicts, genuine\nsources of instability, of intolerable suffering and of\napocalyptic movements of populations and\nimpoverishment. That is why the Government of Niger\nwelcomed the Security Council initiative to invite the\nSecretary-General to submit a report to it on the causes of\nconflict in Africa and their possible remedies. I would\nlike once again to congratulate the Secretary-General on\nthe important report (S/1998/318) he submitted, a report\nremarkable for its frankness and its realistic\nrecommendations for assuring durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa. It is our earnest hope\nthat this report will contribute to awakening the human\nconscience and bringing the international community to a\npoint where it will further help the efforts of the African\ncountries in their unremitting search for peace and\nprosperity.\n6\n\n\nWithin the framework of the efforts made in Africa to\nredress the situation, the people and Government of Niger\nwelcome the success this year in defusing numerous\nconflicts, particularly those in the Central African Republic\nand Sierra Leone. By personally participating in the\nfestivities which marked the return to power of Mr. Ahmad\nTejan Kabbah, the democratically elected President of\nSierra Leone, I was able to show my Government and\npeople?s deep commitment to democratic processes and the\nestablishment of the rule of law in Africa.\nThis is a good opportunity to pay tribute to the\ndecisive, beneficial role played by the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring\nGroup (ECOMOG) in the restoration of constitutional\nlegality and the return of calm to Sierra Leone, thereby\nimplementing the political will and determination of the\nECOWAS heads of State. The exemplary intervention of\nECOWAS to resolve conflicts in the West Africa subregion\ntestifies to the opportuneness of giving more responsibility\nto subregional and regional organizations in the prevention\nand management of conflicts. Their unparalleled local\nknowledge could, when necessary, be given the logistic\nsupport and expertise of the United Nations to deal with\nlocal conflicts, in keeping with the prescriptions of the\nAgenda for Peace of the Secretary-General and with the\nprovisions of the Charter.\nDespite major progress achieved in this respect, the\nhostilities which are troubling several subregions show that\nthe goal of peace is far from being achieved on the\ncontinent.\nSomalia remains deep in torment, despite laudable\nefforts by neighbouring countries and the international\ncommunity to promote national reconciliation and the\nrestoration of a normal political and social life.\nConfrontations and strife are continuing in the Great\nLakes region, where instability and insecurity, as well as\nthe poverty which accompanies massive movements of\npopulations, daily trouble our consciences.\nFaced with the unremitting recurrence of differences\nand disputes which degenerate here and there into armed\nconflicts, we urge the countries concerned to show restraint\nand to accede, with the help of the international community,\nto offers of mediation to resolve their differences, in\nkeeping with the provisions of the Charter of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to\nwhich they have freely subscribed.\nCertain claims relating to identity, as well as the\nexacerbation of social, cultural or political characteristics,\noften generate violent upheavals, which may rapidly take\nthe form of terrorism, at times blind and bloody. Faced\nwith these phenomena, the international community must\nunite in efforts to pursue and deepen its thinking and the\ncollective action initiated a few years ago at the Sharm el-\nSheikh summit in Egypt, in order to deal appropriately\nwith these problems.\nIn this regard, Niger would like, through me, from\nthis lofty rostrum, to reaffirm once again its firm\ncondemnation of terrorism and any use of violence in\nrelations between nations, peoples and States. Just as we\nexplicitly and firmly condemned the cowardly attacks\ncarried out last August against American diplomatic\nrepresentatives in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, and in\nNairobi, Kenya, so do we disapprove of the unilateral\nresort to military force against sovereign States.\nIn this regard, the Government of Niger deplores the\nattack against the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in\nKhartoum, an attack which took the lives of many\ninnocent people and undermined the provision of\npharmaceutical products in several countries of the region.\nTherefore, it seems necessary to us to consider quickly\nsending to Khartoum an international mission of inquiry,\nas requested by the Sudanese authorities. We in Niger\nbelieve the request to be sincere, having had the privilege\nof visiting on 6 May the sites and the pharmaceutical\nfactory in question.\nThe Middle East peace process has been at a\nstalemate for more than a year now despite the invaluable\nefforts of its sponsors to revive it. Therefore it is\nnecessary to deploy every effort to bring the Government\nof Prime Minister Netanyahu to a point where it will\nrespect the commitments Israel has solemnly made.\nThe Government and people of Niger would like to\nreiterate their unswerving support for the cause of the\nPalestinian people and to reaffirm once again their\nconviction that no peace in the Middle East can be just\nand lasting until the Palestinian people regain their\ninalienable rights, including their right to establish an\nindependent state on their national territory.\nOf course, peace in the region also means the\nwithdrawal by Israel from the Syrian Golan and from\nsouthern Lebanon. That is why my Government welcomes\nthe recent General Assembly resolution giving more\nprerogatives to the Palestinian representation within the\n7\n\n\nAssembly. It is our wish that this significant progress lead\nto the recognition of Palestine as a fully fledged member of\nthe community of States.\nTurning to the question of Jammu and Kashmir, Niger,\nwhich supports the just struggle of the people of Kashmir\nto exercise their inalienable right to self-determination,\ndeeply wishes that the international community continue to\ngive full attention to this issue.\nThe arms race and the escalation that we have seen in\nthat area recently strengthens our conviction that we should\nurgently convene a new and fourth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on disarmament. Additional progress\nappears indispensable in the area of the control of weapons\nof mass destruction and the establishment of more effective\nstandards concerning conventional weapons.\nThe success achieved in banning anti-personnel mines\nshould encourage us to go farther in order to bring about a\nbetter regulation of small arms and small-calibre weapons.\nIn this case my country welcomes the measures taken to\nstrengthen the Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament\nin Lom\u00e9.\nFor several decades our Organization has been seeking\nto adopt a coherent approach to effectively meet the major\nchallenges of poverty and development, in particular by\nworking to establish a strengthened world partnership to\nfinance development. It is time, therefore, to reverse the\ntrend of reduced official development assistance and to join\nour efforts together to increase the scope of that assistance\nby revising its modalities. In this respect my country\nexpects a great deal from the second Tokyo International\nConference on African Development, set for October 1998.\nWe expect that Conference to explore new strategies for\nmobilizing official development assistance and to reaffirm\nthe international community?s commitment to make the\ndevelopment of Africa one of its priorities.\nIt is indispensable, moreover, resolutely to implement\nbold policies to relieve and even to forgive the external\ndebt of the poorer countries as part of a general agreement\nto resolve this problem, whose solution is overdue. That\nexternal debt represents an insuperable hindrance to any\neffort to bring about economic growth and human\ndevelopment in a large number of developing countries, and\nin particular in the most deprived among them.\nThe marginalization of the African continent is\ncontinuing, which, in this era of globalization, calls for the\nestablishment of an international mechanism that is capable\nof ensuring a more extensive integration of the developing\ncountries into the world economy.\nAs is well known, my country, Niger, is facing\nvarious factors that limit its efforts at development:\nincreasingly harsh climatic conditions; food shortages;\nstrong demographic pressure; being landlocked; a drop in\nthe price of its main export product, uranium; too heavy\nan external debt; and low investment. All of these things\nhave contributed to making us for some time now a\ncountry at the bottom of the ladder in terms of the human\ndevelopment index.\nBut we have never given up, and my Government\nhas drafted a national programme framework to combat\npoverty, proposing as a participatory measure a package\nof strategies in the medium term intended to control this\nscourge and to stimulate economic growth. This\nprogramme, moreover, is an essential component of our\nEconomic Recovery Programme, which was adopted by\nour National Assembly in July 1997 and which last\nMarch in Geneva was the subject of a particularly\nsuccessful round table.\nI take this opportunity, since these organizations are\npart of the United Nations system, to say here how deeply\nwe thank not only the Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 but\nalso the United Nations Development Programme, the\nUnited Nations Children?s Fund and the United Nations\nPopulation Fund. These agencies, which often have been\namong the first to perceive the key role that the right\npolitical and social environment plays in creative reform\nat the national level, have given us the benefit of their\nexpertise and their advice and thus contributed to the\nsuccess of that round table. We are certain that the\npromises of contributions they made at that meeting will\nvery rapidly materialize.\nAt this stage I wish to reaffirm solemnly here in the\nAssembly and before the entire international community\nthat the democratic process is making headway in Niger\nand will remain irreversible under my guidance. The\nvitality of our democracy is reflected in, inter alia, a\nmulti-party system, with an unhindered opposition, that is\ntirelessly attempting to establish a culture of dialogue and\npeace on a permanent basis. But our democracy is also\nreflected in the existence of a totally free private press, a\ncivil society that plays a front-ranking role and an\nindependent judicial system that is determined to protect\nthe rights and freedoms that the Constitution guarantees\nto citizens.\n8\n\n\nAs part of strengthening the democratic process and\nconsolidating peace, particular attention is being given to\nstrengthen intermediate bodies, which are important partners\nof civil society \u2014 the non-governmental organizations,\nassociations and labour unions \u2014 so as to allow them\neffectively to contribute to the process of creating a more\ndynamic and conscious political life. My Government is\nresolutely committed to consolidating these democratic\nachievements, as evidenced by the holding on 22 November\nof this year of local elections that will establish a policy of\ndecentralization which we have chosen to promote the\nparticipation of the people in development and also to bring\nabout good governance in Niger.\nSimilarly, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, I wish to reaffirm\nsolemnly that my Government will work tirelessly to do\neverything in its power to bring about respect for, and to\nrespect, human rights, based on its conviction that this\nrespect is a precondition for the progress of human society.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the full\nconfidence that we have in the United Nations. In our view,\nthis irreplaceable institution remains the only forum that can\nensure the advent of a new world order based on justice,\nfairness, liberty and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Our presence here\ntoday is, for my delegation and my country, cause for\nsome celebration. This is the thirtieth anniversary of our\nfirst participation in the General Assembly. Upon the\nattainment of our independence in 1968, the father of the\nnation, the then Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur\nRamgoolam, addressed the United Nations.\nI join the speakers before me in congratulating\nMr. Opertti on his assumption of the office of President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.\nI would also like to thank his predecessor,\nMr. Udovenko, for the manner in which he conducted the\nwork of the previous session.\nI wish to commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his wise leadership and vision, which have\nbeen a source of renewed confidence in the future of this\nOrganization. We welcome his efforts to lead a reformed\nand more effective United Nations into the twenty-first\ncentury to better carry out our mission of peace,\ndevelopment and human rights. We wish to assure him of\nour total support in the continuation of the reform\nprocess.\nWe are alive to the intense debate on the reform of\nthe Security Council. We reiterate our position that the\nSecurity Council should be enlarged and made more\ndemocratic and representative. In this respect, we reaffirm\nour commitment to the stand taken by the Non-Aligned\nMovement at the recent Summit in Durban.\nIn recent years the world has been profoundly\ntransformed by the powerful forces of globalization and\nliberalization.\nAll countries are now inextricably linked as\ndistances between them become increasingly immaterial\nthrough great leaps in information technology and\ncommunications.\nThe tremors triggered by the crises of the South-East\nAsian economies and, more recently, the turmoil in the\nworld financial markets have shown in a dramatic way\nthe dangers of the contagion effect. Even those countries\nwhich are trying to be efficient and competitive face the\npossibility of external shocks because of the volatility of\ncapital markets.\n7\n\n\nI believe that the world community should devise\ncreative and effective mechanisms to prevent emerging\neconomies which have put in hard work from losing the\nfruits of liberalization.\nWe must not go back to the inward-looking strategies\nof the 1960s. We must continue to open our economies, but\nwith greater caution.\nThis is a great challenge for a large majority of\nnations, particularly the least developed ones. We know\nonly too well that a number of developing countries are\namong the most vulnerable and are not yet ready to\nintegrate into the global economy.\nWhen I last addressed this Assembly, I dwelled at\nsome length on the generally grim situation in Africa,\nwhich remains one of the most intractable challenges to the\nworld community. It is a continent rich in natural resources\nand yet afflicted by widespread poverty.\nPeace and development in Africa have been, for more\nthan a decade, the subject of endless debates and\nresolutions at the United Nations. But we know that\nsustainable development in Africa is conditional upon the\nachievement of a strife-free continent. It is sad indeed that\nyear after year the number of potential flashpoints seems to\ngrow more numerous. The situation in many regions of\nAfrica remains a cause for great concern.\nThe peoples of the continent can ill afford the\npointless strife and violence visited upon them at a time\nwhen the priorities should be economic and social\ndevelopment.\nWe in Africa naturally have to bear the primary\nresponsibility for assuring lasting peace for our peoples.\nThis is precisely what the leaders of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) are striving to achieve.\nIn his statement to this Assembly, on Monday,\nPresident Nelson Mandela, current Chairman of SADC,\nmentioned the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo. This difficult problem figured prominently on\nthe agenda of the summit which Mauritius hosted a few\ndays ago, after it was addressed earlier by the Victoria Falls\nmeeting and the Pretoria special SADC summit.\nI wish to renew here our appeal to all parties involved\nin this conflict to solve their differences peacefully through\npolitical dialogue and diplomacy. In the Indian Ocean\nregion to our immediate southwest, Mauritius is\nparticipating fully in the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the countries of that region\nto seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis facing the\nComoros on account of separatist activities by a group on\nthe island of Anjouan. Mauritius fully supports the unity\nand territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of the\nComoros.\nFortunately, however, all is not gloom when we\nsurvey Africa. We note with satisfaction the continuous\npositive economic growth that most sub-Saharan countries\nhave enjoyed lately.\nI had the privilege to participate in a round table\ntogether with the Deputy President of South Africa earlier\nthis year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, on the\nnew competitive Africa. The consensus was that Africa\nstands at the threshold of a new era \u2014 an era of\nopportunity and dynamism. We are at the dawn of an\nAfrican renaissance.\nGovernments in Africa are becoming increasingly\ndemocratic and responsive, putting more emphasis on\neconomic development, greater openness, market-oriented\npolicies and greater economic reform.\nRegional cooperation is another positive feature of\nthe new Africa, working through groupings such as\nSADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\nAfrica (COMESA) and the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) to facilitate cross-border\ntrade leading to the ultimate establishment of an African\nEconomic Community.\nBut for Africa to realize its full potential, several\nserious constraints will have to be overcome.\nThe international economic environment should be\nmade less hostile to Africa. Africa\u2019s shares of world trade\nand foreign direct investment still remain at a paltry level.\nThe debt burden has become in itself a crippling\nfactor and needs urgently to be alleviated.\nWe also cannot sufficiently emphasize the\nimportance of official development assistance in this\nregard. We therefore deeply deplore the decline in the\nlevels of official development assistance among the major\ndonor countries. Today, they stand at a historical low. We\nare now, more than ever, far off the target of 0.7 per cent\nof gross national product recommended by this Assembly.\nThis trend must be reversed.\n8\n\n\nMauritius took the initiative recently of highlighting\nthe specificities of small island economies in the context of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the negotiations\nof a successor agreement to the Lom\u00e9 IV Convention. As\na result, recent ministerial declarations adopted by both the\nWTO and the OAU now contain explicit references to small\neconomies and their high vulnerability. This reality is now\ngaining recognition within the Bretton Woods institution.\nFor the reasons I have just mentioned, small\neconomies require time and space to adjust to the new\nworld trade order. We therefore reiterate the need for the\nmaintenance of non-reciprocal trade regimes until such a\ntime as we are adequately prepared.\nThe Lom\u00e9 Convention is a model of North-South\ncooperation. The proposed United States African Growth\nand Opportunity Act could become another. Together with\nthe other members of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), we would like to reaffirm\nour total support for its passage.\nMauritius has always accorded the highest priority to\nregionalization to break out of its insularity and enlarge its\neconomic base. Mauritius was a major player in launching,\n15 years ago, the Indian Ocean Commission and, more\nrecently, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional\nCooperation.\nThe Assembly will appreciate that an island State like\nMauritius would be interested in the protection of the\nmarine environment. We recommend for the particular\nattention of the General Assembly the report of the\nIndependent World Commission on the Oceans, according\nto which the very survival of the human race over the long\nterm is jeopardized by the abuses to which the world\u2019s\noceans are subjected.\nWe have to address as a matter of priority the three\nmost immediate dangers identified by the Commission: the\noverexploitation of marine biological resources, the\ndumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global\nwarming. While much has been achieved since the Rio\nEarth Summit, we deplore the fact that the initial\nmomentum and urgency appear to have been lost in sterile\nand fractious debate. I urge that we address these questions,\non which our very survival depends, with renewed\nearnestness and a greater sense of shared responsibility.\n(spoke in French)\nIn December we will celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the adoption and proclamation by this\nAssembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nFor us, that will also provide an opportunity to recall\nanother milestone in the history of human rights: the\nadoption by the French Constituent Assembly of the\ndeclaration of the rights of man and of the citizen more\nthan two centuries ago.\nAt this historic moment, we wish to recall the\npreamble of the Charter of our Organization, which\nproclaims our\n\u201cfaith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity\nand worth of the human person, in the equal rights\nof men and women and of nations large and small\u201d.\nWe also reaffirm our profound belief in the equality\nof all rights \u2014 social, economic and cultural, as well as\ncivil and political. Today, Governments can no longer\nflout the rights of their citizens without being subjected to\nthe censure of the international community. Yet millions\nof inhabitants of many parts of the world remain deprived\nof their fundamental rights by oppressors and tyrants who\ngovern by force. We have observed with horror the\natrocious crimes against the dignity and worth of the\nhuman being committed during recent conflicts. My\nGovernment therefore welcomes the recent adoption in\nRome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.\n(spoke in English)\nMy Government believes that respect for human\nrights is but one facet of the indispensable foundation of\nthe harmonious development of a country. Democracy\nand transparent and accountable government, as well as\neffective participation by civil society, are the other\nessential ingredients for successful development.\nConsidering the complex sociocultural and ethnic mix of\nour population, we have taken great care to ensure that all\nour citizens, regardless of their origins or gender, have\nequal access to education, adequate health care, proper\nhousing and employment opportunities. We will soon\nintroduce in our own National Assembly a protection of\nhuman rights bill, which will provide for the\nestablishment of a National Human Rights Commission.\nAt the continental African level, participants at the\nThird Conference of African Women Parliamentarians,\nwhich Mauritius was privileged to host, adopted the Port\nLouis Declaration, calling for increased political\ncommitment at all levels for the promotion of gender\n9\n\n\nequality and the empowerment of women. We in Mauritius\nare taking legislative measures to translate our commitment\ninto practical reality.\nWe have now become even more aware of the need to\nseek global solutions to our common problems. Climate\nchange, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism are problems\nwhich require a coordinated international approach. No\nnation can live under a dome, with its climate isolated from\nthe rest of the world. No country can on its own fight\ninternational drug traffickers or terrorism. We therefore\ncondemn unequivocally all forms of terrorism and call for\nenhanced international cooperation to combat and prevent\nits occurrence.\nWhile social, economic and trade matters are\nincreasingly \u2014 and with good reason \u2014 occupying centre\nstage in international forums, crucial problems of security\nand disarmament continue to retain their capacity to derail\nour efforts for development.\nEarlier this year we were reminded of the dangers for\nhumanity of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\nattendant risks of a new arms race. No country can feel\ngenuinely secure as long as the threat of nuclear weapons\nexists from any quarter. In this respect, we welcome the\nstand taken by both India and Pakistan in exercising self-\nrestraint. We reiterate our position that any international\ninstrument for the elimination of nuclear arsenals should be\nnon-discriminatory in nature. Security for all will be\nachieved only when that threat is completely eliminated.\nGlobal nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of all\nweapons of mass destruction must remain our ultimate goal.\nFinally, as on past occasions, we would like to bring\nup once more before this Assembly our lasting claim on the\nsovereignty of two territories which were taken from our\npatrimony: the island of Tromelin and the Chagos\narchipelago. We reiterate our call to the former colonial\nPowers to enter into constructive bilateral dialogue with my\nGovernment for the early restoration of those territories to\nthe sovereignty of Mauritius.\nRegarding the Chagos archipelago, this Assembly\nshould also be reminded that some 1,500 inhabitants \u2014 the\nso-called \u201cIllois\u201d \u2014 were coerced to leave their homeland\nto clear the way for a military base. Most of the families,\nwho had lived for generations on these islands, were moved\nto the main island of Mauritius, victims of the then\nprevailing cold war. Today, after more than 30 years, they\nstill experience tremendous difficulties adapting to their\npresent conditions. Many yearn to be resettled on these\nislands. As we are about to commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of this century\u2019s seminal document on human\nrights, we consider that we owe it to these Illois to fully\nre-establish their rights, including the right of return.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me at the very outset\nextend to Mr. Opertti our warm congratulations upon his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nthird session. We are particularly pleased to see presiding\nthe Foreign Minister of Uruguay, a country with which\nIreland has always enjoyed the friendliest of relations. His\nrich experience in politics, education, diplomacy and the\nlaw will serve the Assembly well as he directs its work for\nthe coming year.\nAlso on behalf of the Irish people, I wish to pay a\nparticular tribute to the Secretary-General for the thoughtful\nand determined leadership which he has brought from the\nAfrican continent to the discharge of his most challenging\noffice.\nCommitment to the work of this Organization is a\ncentral part of Ireland?s foreign policy and of her place in\nthe world. Irish people strongly support that commitment.\nWe feel close bonds with the United Nations. With many\nlike-minded countries, we have striven to uphold and\ndevelop the universal role of the Organization for the\npromotion of peace, development, international cooperation\nand human rights. These purposes are linked in the Charter\nand they are linked in reality.\nAll around us, side by side with rapid technological\nand material development, we see in every region of the\nworld uncertainty, insecurity and conflict.\nOur attention has been gripped this year by the severe\neconomic and financial difficulties which are besetting\ndeveloped and emerging markets as well as economies in\ntransition. The full effects of these difficulties have yet to\nplay themselves out. We are all affected.\nMore than 1 billion people struggle to survive on less\nthan a dollar a day. Environmental degradation and natural\ndisasters wreak unnecessary havoc on entire nations.\nMeanwhile, obscenely disproportionate levels of resources\nare diverted to fuel the arms trade and supply the\nunjustifiably large arsenals in parts of the world that can\nleast afford it. Human rights remain to be fully respected in\nall regions.\nI think that these realities are among the root causes\nof the conflicts confronting us today. If the new millennium\nis to open with real prospects of alleviating such conflict\nsituations, it is the root causes which we must together\ntackle; prevention is always better, and certainly less costly,\nthan cure.\nAs my Swedish colleague has said, the Austrian\nPresidency has spoken and addressed the Assembly on\nbehalf of the 15 Member States of the European Union,\nexpressing our position on many issues. Nevertheless, I\nwill focus my remarks on a number of issues which are\nof particular importance to the country which I represent.\nWe should all acknowledge that there can be no real\npeace or security without development. Development is\nabout dignity and offering impoverished people around\nthe world the chance of a better life now and better\nprospects for their children. This is not too much to ask.\nIts achievement, however, requires a new partnership of\ninternational engagement and commitment. All of us must\nshare a determination to break down the walls of\nexclusion and marginalization that divide our world.\nA new partnership must address not only aid flows\nbut also the crippling problem of debt. It must assist\ndeveloping countries to participate on a fair basis in the\nworld economy. Development cooperation is not only\nabout reducing unacceptable levels of poverty. All\ncountries, developed and developing alike, must together\naddress shared priorities that affect all our countries and\nall our peoples. An integrated approach is called for, as\nprevious speakers have mentioned.\nIn this context, I welcome in particular the seminal\nreport of the Secretary-General \u2014 I have already\nwelcomed it in a committee today \u2014 on the causes of\nconflict and sustainable development in Africa. We will\nwork actively with other Member States to ensure that\nthis report receives the strongly positive response it\ndeserves.\nI will allude for a moment to Ireland?s development\ncooperation programme, if I may. As for Ireland?s\ncontribution, it is with some pride that I can say that we\nhave one of the fastest growing development cooperation\nprogrammes in the world today. The Irish Government is\ncommitted to reaching the United Nations target for\nofficial development assistance \u2014 that is, 0.7 per cent of\ngross national product \u2014 and I think it?s fair to say that\nwe are fully determined to make further progress towards\nthis goal in the coming years.\nLast week, my Government agreed on a package of\ndebt alleviation measures for developing countries, in the\nmultilateral and bilateral fields, amounting to some $46\nmillion, which is a considerable sum of money for a\ncountry the size of Ireland, and I think it was a measure\n36\n\n\nof the bona fides of our intention in this whole area of\ndevelopment cooperation.\nFor Ireland, support for development cooperation\nmeans, by definition, support for the United Nations in this\nvital area. The United Nations has only the resources which\nthe Member States give it. These must reflect our political\ncommitment to confront challenges. I think that is why\ndeclining contributions to core resources for United Nations\nfunds, programmes and agencies are a matter of deep and\ngrave concern.\nFor its part, Ireland has increased significantly the\nlevel of its commitment. I am pleased to say that our\nDevelopment Assistance Programme now supports 32\nfunds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations\nsystem, compared to 13 just five years ago. I pledge before\nthis Assembly the continuation of Ireland?s support in that\nregard.\nAgain, the question of disarmament and nuclear\ndisarmament was raised by my Swedish colleague, the\nprevious speaker. The end of the cold war provided the\ninternational community with a unique opportunity to\naccomplish the final elimination of nuclear weapons and to\nusher in a nuclear-free world. Yet, while the past 10 years\nhave witnessed important steps to reduce nuclear arsenals,\nthere has been no clear commitment on the part of nuclear-\nweapon States to proceed rapidly to nuclear disarmament,\nas required by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT).\nIreland?s advocacy of nuclear disarmament has been\nconsistent and unrelenting. We have been the strongest\nprotagonists of the achievement of the goals of the nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, which Ireland proposed in 1958\nand was the author of at that time. We must begin to take\ncertain fundamental steps now to achieve the NPT?s non-\ndiscriminatory and universal application. We cannot enter\nthe third millennium with the prospect that nuclear weapons\nwill be considered legitimate for the indefinite future.\nThat is why Ireland has, this year, joined with seven\nlike-minded States \u2014 Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand,\nSlovenia, South Africa and Sweden \u2014 to launch the\ndeclaration \u201cTowards a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World: The\nNeed for A New Agenda\u201d. The steps called for in the New\nAgenda are premised on a clear and unambiguous\ncommitment to be undertaken by the five nuclear-weapon\nStates to engage in nuclear disarmament negotiations within\nan entirely new context. They are also premised on a\nsimilar commitment by the three nuclear-weapon-capable\nStates \u2014 India, Pakistan and, of course, Israel \u2014 not\nparties to the NPT.\nThis session of the General Assembly provides a\nunique opportunity to give substance to proposals such as\nthose contained in the Joint Ministerial Declaration of 9\nJune. My colleagues and I have therefore prepared a draft\nresolution which sets out an agenda for the definitive\nelimination of nuclear weapons for all time and which we\nask the Assembly to consider and adopt in the First\nCommittee.\nOn the question of landmines, coincidentally and\nfortuitously, last week I presided over a landmine\nconference in Dublin while the International Campaign to\nBan Landmines was meeting in my own capital city to\ndevelop a civil-society-based landmine monitor. We\nreceived the welcome news that the fortieth ratification of\nthe landmines Convention had just taken place. We now\nhave a total ban in place and can set our minds to\neradicating these obscene instruments and their\nconsequences.\nThe inexcusable delay in addressing the question of\nlandmines was a glaring failure of the international\ncommunity to look squarely at an issue of human security\nwhich was fundamental to development. Another example\nis the persistence of expenditure on arms in certain\ncountries, which is out of all proportion to social\nspending. This state of affairs must cease and the arms\ntrade that feeds it must be curtailed. I would personally\nlike to see it stopped and put out of existence.\nOn the question of human rights, a further and very\npervasive root cause of instability and conflict is\ninadequate respect of the very rights of which I am\nspeaking. There are too many specific instances of human\nrights abuse in every region of the world. There are\nhopeful signs \u2014 for example, in Nigeria and East\nTimor \u2014 but elsewhere the situation remains bleak.\nIn this, the fiftieth anniversary year of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, we must reaffirm our\ncollective commitment to promoting respect for these\nrights and freedoms by progressive measures, national and\ninternational, to secure their universal recognition and\nobservance. The Universal Declaration, in my view, is as\nrelevant today as it was five decades ago when it was\ndrafted by the representatives of developed and\ndeveloping countries with important input from members\nof civil society. It is a universal benchmark.\n37\n\n\nWe all have questions to answer. The first might be:\nHow have we lived up to the standards set out in the\nUniversal Declaration? What steps have we taken to build\non the Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted five\nyears ago by consensus at the Vienna Conference, which\nspecifically reaffirmed the right to development? These are\nsome questions that we might well ask ourselves during the\ncurrent session of the Assembly.\nOn the question of capital punishment, another\nimportant human rights issue is the abuse of the death\npenalty. Ireland will continue to work for the universal\nabolition of capital punishment. We welcome the fact that\nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights, again at\nits recent fifty-fourth session, addressed this issue directly.\nWe also welcome the adoption in July of the Statute\nfor the International Criminal Court at the international\nconference hosted so effectively by Italy. This is truly a\nlandmark development. Nobody is and nobody should be\nabove the law. We fervently hope that the Statute will enter\ninto force on the earliest possible date and that it will\nsecure universal adherence.\nFinally, let me join with those many others who have\ngiven support and encouragement to the Secretary-General\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The\npromotion of international cooperation in this key area must\nremain one of this great Organization?s first priorities.\nOn the question of conflict prevention, I now turn to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, which,\nof course, is the prime responsibility and prime aim of the\nUnited Nations. The painful experiences of this decade \u2014\nnotably in the former Yugoslavia, Africa and the Middle\nEast \u2014 have prompted much soul-searching and, of course,\nanalysis.\nIn Kosovo, we are witnessing a humanitarian\ncatastrophe which could replicate the horrors of Bosnia.\nThe international community must take urgent and effective\naction within the framework of the United Nations to\nensure that our worst fears are not realized.\nAnother humanitarian disaster faces us in Sudan.\nRecently, I saw for myself the terrible suffering of its\npeople. I visited the epicentre of the famine in Ajip in\nsouthern Sudan, having spent three hours getting there from\na town called Lokichokio in northern Kenya, which was a\nstaging post for aid for that part of the terribly blighted\ncountry of southern Sudan. It is not acceptable that we\nallow this tragedy to continue. One of the essential\nconclusions, here again, is the need to address the origins\nof conflict and not just the symptoms. Foresight and\nadaptability are necessary.\nIn this context, I welcome in particular the emphasis\nwhich the Secretary-General has placed on the need to\ntackle the root causes of conflict in all their complex\ndiversity. We support his strengthening of United Nations\nearly-warning mechanisms and his prioritizing of\npreventive diplomacy. The many strengths and capabilities\nof the United Nations and the regional organizations in\nthe area of conflict prevention must be harnessed and\nfocused to achieve greater use of resources.\nThe General Assembly, for its part, is placing ever\ngreater emphasis on conflict prevention. It has\ncommended not least the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and acknowledged the contribution\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE), a regional organization which Ireland\nfully supports.\nOn the question of peacekeeping, in this, the fiftieth\nanniversary year of United Nations peacekeeping, I want\nto pay tribute to the peacekeepers who currently serve the\nOrganization. They do so often in very difficult and\ndangerous circumstances. Too many have made the\nultimate sacrifice. Since 1958, Ireland has been at the\nforefront of United Nations peacekeeping. In this period,\nsome 40,000 Irish peacekeepers have served with the\nOrganization across the world. Seventy-five of my fellow\nIrishmen have given their lives.\nAmong Member States, Ireland is currently one of\nthe leading troop contributors. My President, Mrs. Mary\nMcAleese, in one of her earliest official engagements,\nvisited our peacekeepers in Lebanon. Again, this\nunderlines Ireland?s active commitment to bringing peace\nto that part of the world. The world continues to need\nUnited Nations peacekeeping, but its operations must be\nbased on sound mandates and have solid political and\nfinancial support.\nColleagues have mentioned the question of United\nNations reform. Mobilizing the political will to tackle the\ninterrelated causes of insecurity and conflict, I believe, is\nonly the first step. The United Nations as an institution\nmust be strengthened and given the necessary resources\nto carry through its work. Timely funding by Member\nStates is a prerequisite.\n38\n\n\nIreland believes that the reform process should not be\nviewed as a cost-cutting exercise. The wretched expression\n\u201cdownsizing\u201d comes to mind. It is about making the\nOrganization more effective in the discharge of its Charter\nfunctions, especially in the economic, social and\nhumanitarian fields. I welcome the progress achieved to\ndate. Ireland will continue with other like-minded States to\nbuild partnerships among the membership so that real\nprogress can be achieved.\nWe have views in relation to the area of Security\nCouncil reform. A reinvigorated United Nations must\ninclude a reformed Security Council that reflects the\nrealities and the needs of today?s world. We believe that the\nCouncil must work more transparently and that its\nmembership should be enlarged to ensure a more equitable\nrepresentation. To this end, we have joined with a group of\nlike-minded States in putting forward a number of specific\nproposals. We will continue to work for an agreed outcome\non this issue of crucial importance to the future of this\nOrganization of ours.\nOn the question of Ireland?s candidature, Ireland\nbelieves that all Member States \u2014 small, like ourselves, as\nwell as large \u2014 should have an opportunity to serve on the\nSecurity Council, the body on which the Members of the\nOrganization have conferred primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\nAssembly will be aware that Ireland has presented its\ncandidature for non-permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil for the two-year term 2001-2002. Throughout its\nmembership of the United Nations, Ireland has worked to\nplay a bridge-building role among Member States. As a\nmember of the Security Council, Ireland?s approach would\nsimilarly reflect the interests of the totality of the broad\nspectrum of the membership.\nI can give the Assembly some good news about\nNorthern Ireland. My predecessors have by custom\ninformed this Assembly of our efforts to help promote\npeace in Northern Ireland. It is my deep privilege,\ntherefore, to convey an account of a breakthrough of great\nimportance: the Agreement reached by the British and Irish\nGovernments and eight Northern Ireland parties in Belfast\non Good Friday, 10 April 1998.\nThe Good Friday Agreement marks a historic new\nbeginning in relations within Northern Ireland, between the\nNorth and the South of the island and between Ireland and\nBritain. It has brought us all a new sense of hope. We have\nbegun the long walk out of the dark night of division and\nconflict into the bright sunlight of partnership and harmony.\nAs somebody who has spent almost 40 years in political\nlife seeking to encourage such a journey, I am immensely\ngratified by this development.\nThe Agreement is a complex document, a careful set\nof checks and balances, a parity of pain and gain. Striking\nthat balance of pain and gain on both sides was, in large\npart, the task of the main political parties in Northern\nIreland. Their decisions called for political courage and\nmost serious and genuine leadership, which they gave in\nabundance. But they could not have been taken without\ntrust and vision, too \u2014 trust, where before there was only\nsuspicion, and vision, where before there had only been\nself-interest. The leadership of these peacemakers in\nNorthern Ireland deserves the warmest commendation of\nthis Assembly.\nWith the participants drawn from the full spectrum\nof the political landscape, what we were addressing in the\nnegotiations was a complex range of problems and\nperspectives, each with its deep roots in history. If these\ncompeting issues were to be addressed satisfactorily, we\nknew the final Agreement would itself have to be\ncomplex, broad-based and balanced.\nAchieving agreement in these circumstances was a\nmajor challenge for all of us involved in the long,\ntortuous and difficult negotiations. As one of those\nprivileged to have had such a role, I can verify that there\nwere times during the long days and nights in Castle\nBuildings, Belfast, when success seemed like some distant\ndream. But the determination of all sides not to be\ndeflected was stronger than any obstacle. On the dawn of\nGood Friday, the dream of agreement finally became a\nreality.\nCritically, the Agreement was emphatically endorsed\nby the people of Ireland, North and South, in referendums\nheld on the same day, the first time that has happened on\nthe island of Ireland since 1918. One of the profound\nconsequences of this democratic endorsement is that never\nagain may the name of the people be invoked as a basis\nfor the shedding of blood in my country and on my\nisland. From now on, it is manifest that the only\nlegitimate force is the force of reason and persuasion.\nThe Good Friday Agreement is a blueprint for our\nfuture. Indeed, it may be a blueprint for other regions?\nfutures. But a blueprint can be successful only if it is\ntranslated from word to deed. That vital process of\nimplementation is the next great challenge and one that\nwe are all now actively addressing. Some elements of the\n39\n\n\nAgreement are already in place. The new Northern Ireland\nAssembly has been elected and the 108 members have\ntaken their seats. Dramatically symbolizing the new era of\npartnership, David Trimble and my good friend Seamus\nMallon, each representing the two major traditions, have\nbeen appointed First Minister and Deputy First Minister,\nrespectively. The Assembly has made an encouraging and\nconstructive start. Work is also proceeding on many of the\nother elements of the Agreement.\nBut institution-building alone, important as it is, will\nnot be enough. The appalling atrocities of last summer,\nwhich saw the horrific burning to death of three young\nboys, the Quinn brothers, and the merciless massacre and\nslaughter of 29 people in Omagh underline the reality that\nthe Agreement on its own does not guarantee peace. More\nthan anything else, what is also required is what Seamus\nMallon calls a new politics. At the heart of that new\npolitics must be a determination to work in a new way for\nthe wider good. All of us have constituencies to represent,\nbut we must find new ways to balance that requirement\nwith the needs of the wider society. That, I would suggest,\nis what partnership means. That, I would suggest, is what\npartnership is all about. It also shows how trust and\nreconciliation are built.\nIf the new politics is to work on the island of Ireland,\nwe must seek to develop, on the basis of mutual respect,\nnew ways of listening to each other; new ways of talking\nto each other; new ways of understanding each other; and,\ncritically, new ways of working together.\nWe are bringing this century to a close. The existence\nof this great Organization of States devoted to peace\nreflects the turbulence of the decade. Great progress has\nbeen made, but a great price has also been paid. Each of us\nin our own way has had to grapple with the instinct to war\nand division. The experience of Ireland echoes the\nexperiences of so many other States. We realized our desire\nfor independence in the wake of the Great War. Our birth\nas a State was darkened by the horrors of civil war. We in\nthe South of the island overcame our divisions, channelled\nour differences into peaceful politics and have significantly\nprospered. In the North, divisions and fears were not\nchallenged. They festered and brought us almost three\ndecades of violence.\nThe peace process allowed us to challenge and resolve\nthe fears and divisions generating the conflict. The\nAgreement is a watershed, a harbinger of the new era that\ncoincides with the millennium. It is a great, historic\nrapprochement between nationalism and unionism. All the\nparticipants in the negotiations together have achieved a\ngreat thing. But it is vital that we say to one another, as\nI am now again saying to the unionist community, that we\nrecognize that a new era has dawned, in which all the old\nshibboleths and the old rhetoric must be replaced by a\nnew dialogue, by a new partnership.\nIt is precisely in this spirit of the new politics that\nwe must approach the inevitable difficulties that will arise\nfrom time to time, including at present those relating to\nthe establishment of the \u201cshadow\u201d executive in Northern\nIreland and to decommissioning. It is in the interests of\nall of us who support the Agreement that we resolve the\ndifficulties to the satisfaction of all concerned. If one side\n\u201cwins\u201d, everybody loses. That was the approach that\nsecured the Good Friday Agreement. If one side \u201cwins\u201d,\neverybody loses.\nI should like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to\nthe role of the international community in bringing about\nthe Good Friday Agreement, in particular that of the\nindependent chairman, former Senator George Mitchell of\nthe United States of America, former Prime Minister\nHarri Holkeri of Finland and General John de Chastelain\nof Canada. Their contribution was immense, and General\nde Chastelain?s contribution continues to be. The support\nand solidarity, through the process of our partners in this\nAssembly, and, in particular, of our partners in the\nEuropean Union \u2014 the President of the Commission and\nthe Presidencies of the European Union \u2014 have been\nunparalleled in their contribution, as were the warm and\nencouraging words of the Secretary-General of this\nOrganization. We deeply appreciate it.\nI want in particular to record our very special\ngratitude to the President of the United States, Mr. Bill\nClinton, for his personal commitment to the cause of\npeace in Ireland and for the exceptional solidarity with\nthe peace process he has displayed at all times throughout\nhis presidency. He took the opportunity, when he\naddressed this Assembly last Monday, to mention\nNorthern Ireland and Ireland on three or four or five\noccasions. I think that was an indication of the type of\ncommitment he has and will continue to have in the\nNorthern Ireland peace process.\nFinally, I would like to underline the central and\ncrucial roles played by my own Taoiseach, Irish Prime\nMinister Bertie Ahern, and by British Prime Minister\nTony Blair in the closing days of the negotiations. Their\nparticular role was historic and, in my respectful view,\nheroic.\n40\n\n\nI want to say that, in the spirit of the Charter of this\nOrganization, we are ready to reciprocate the solidarity of\nthe international community by way of sharing the lessons\nof our experience with others, should that be considered\nhelpful. It would be a source of immense additional\nsatisfaction to Ireland, as a committed Member of the\nUnited Nations, if the Good Friday Agreement were to be\nhelpful to conflict resolution elsewhere.\nFinally, and important though international solidarity\nmay be, the reality is that for us in Ireland, as elsewhere,\nthe primary responsibility rests with ourselves. May I recall\nhere the words of a well-known author which have inspired\nvery many:\n\u201cMankind must remember that peace is not God?s gift\nto his creatures; peace is our gift to each other.\u201d\nWith the Good Friday Agreement, we in Ireland have\nenjoyed the gift of peace. We do so in the spirit of the\nCharter of the United Nations. The challenge now is to\nensure that it is passed to our children and to our children?s\nchildren. I know that the members of this Assembly will be\nwith us as we address and take up that particular challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist\nRepublic of Viet Nam, I would like to extend our warmest\ncongratulations to you, Sir, upon your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am\nconvinced that under your wise guidance the work of this\nsession will be crowned with success.\nI wish also to express our high appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, for his major\ncontribution during the fifty-second session, which\nbenefited from his effectiveness as President. I warmly\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his active contribution over the past\nyear to the activities of the United Nations and to the\nreform process.\nAn eventful year has elapsed since the fifty-second\nsession. While undergoing the intense and unpredictable\nimpact generated by the unprecedented financial and\nmonetary crisis, the world community has had to face\ntremendous challenges emerging out of tensions and\nconflicts in many corners of the world, out of policies of\nhegemony and imposition, and out of social injustice and\nthe growing gap between rich and poor countries. However,\npeace, stability and cooperation for development continue\nto mark the prevailing international trend; that trend derives\nfrom the age-old aspirations of humankind and, above all,\nfrom the pressing demand of all peoples in the face of\ntoday?s swiftly changing and complex world. That\nprevailing trend is becoming all the more established in a\nworld context of growing interdependence and of the\nspeedier pace of globalization and regionalization. This\nsituation also presents the international community with as\nmany challenges as opportunities. It must therefore be\nemphasized that least developed and developing countries\nare also confronted with considerable challenges, and that\nthe world?s development takes place in a context of various\nclosely linked factors that have reciprocal impacts.\nIn the light of the many important advances that have\nbeen made in science and technology, no one can deny the\nrole played by developed countries. But the overall\ndevelopment of the integrated global economy cannot\noccur without the active participation of developing\ncountries, which account for the majority of the members\nof the international community.\nGlobalization is characterized principally by the\nrapid expansion of trade and economic relations and the\nswift movement of capital at the international level. We\nmust nevertheless acknowledge that despite the twelve-\nfold growth in the global volume of trade since the end of\nthe Second World War, the share of developing countries\nregistered just a modest increase while that of least\ndeveloped countries has been halved in the last two\ndecades and currently stands at 0.4 per cent of the total\nvalue of international trade. Since the world?s capital\nmoves faster than trade grows, developed countries are\nthe principal beneficiaries of these resources, with the rest\ngoing to a limited number of developing countries.\nIn an environment of economic opening up,\ncharacterized by the growing liberalization of trade and\ninvestment, developing countries \u2014 having\nundercapitalized industries, less efficient management and\ndilapidated equipment \u2014 have to confront unequal and\nrelentless competition in which absolute superiority is\nenjoyed by countries that have advanced technologies at\ntheir disposal and to multinational corporations whose\nrevenues are sometimes even higher than the gross\nnational product of some countries. Undoubtedly, this\ncannot but cause concern to the developing and least\ndeveloped countries that are beginning their global and\nregional economic integration.\nAdditionally, although the current financial and\nmonetary crisis began in East Asia, it is no longer an East\nAsian phenomenon, but has spread like an oil slick to the\nrest of the world and now resembles a dangerous storm\ncausing unpredictable losses across many countries in\ndifferent continents. This illustrates the negative side\neffects of globalization and provides additional proof of\nthe fact that the greater the rate of globalization, the more\ninterrelated both developed and developing economies\nbecome and the more they influence one another.\nThis situation calls for the international community?s\nprogramme of action to include mutual cooperation\nbetween the developed countries and developing and least\ndeveloped countries; and among countries that have\nstrong economies, international institutions and the\ncountries in crisis. It is only through this basic approach\nof mutual assistance that developing countries and\n27\n\n\ncountries in crisis will have an opportunity to join in the\nefforts of the developed countries to overcome the problems\nand make the global economy?s growth more stable, which\nin the long run will benefit everyone. Obviously, such\ncooperation and mutual assistance must be based on mutual\ninterest and respect. It can certainly be said that in a\nsituation of generalized crisis, going to someone else?s aid\nmeans saving oneself.\nWe believe that in adopting this approach, developing\ncountries and countries in crisis should fully exploit their\nown domestic strengths and mobilize their existing potential\nto speed up and take advantage of international aid and\ncooperation. As far as external aid is concerned, we believe\nthat the individual conditions of each recipient country\nshould be taken into account in order to avoid the\nimposition of any remedy that might worsen its situation\nand cause unforeseen effects to social stability.\nFurthermore, we are convinced that in implementing these\nmeasures to stimulate liberalization, attention should be\npaid to the diversity of the global economy, as well as to\nthe heterogeneous nature of national and regional\neconomies. This is the only approach capable of ensuring\nthe efficiency of our cooperation, the beneficial quality of\nour ties and our common prosperity.\nIn this light, we would like to express the following\nhopes.\nMore than ever, developed countries should facilitate\naccess to their markets, accord most-favoured-nation status\nto developing countries \u2014 especially those countries which\nhave been ravaged by the crisis or are suffering from its\nconsequences \u2014 and include them in the Generalized\nSystem of Preferences. They should also support developing\nand least developed countries.\nIt is more necessary than ever to maintain the level of\nofficial development assistance. This is not only necessary\nto halt the downward trend, but also for donor countries to\nseek to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\ngross national product devoted to development by donor\ncountries. Moreover, this assistance is considered important\nfor developing countries because it allows them to\nstrengthen their energy resources and contributes to building\nboth their economic and social infrastructures, elements\nwhich are essential for development and in order to attract\nforeign investments.\nThe role of multilateral institutions \u2014 particularly that\nof the United Nations \u2014 is very important in resolving the\nlong- and short-term problems of developing nations.\nHowever, it is regrettable that United Nations assistance\nto developing countries is continuing to decline. We\ntherefore welcome the adoption of measures by the\nUnited Nations to improve the quality of its development\ncooperation, as well as the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to create a Development Account using the\nsavings realized from reductions in administrative costs.\nThe United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), along with other international organizations and\nbilateral and multilateral donors, is currently working to\nfind solutions to the urgent problems of developing and\nleast developed countries. Viet Nam has in recent years\nbenefited from their considerable assistance, which ranged\nfrom restructuring the economy into a market economy to\nspecific activities in different areas of society, particularly\nin the battle to eliminate famine and reduce poverty.\nMore recently, the effective support provided by the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n(FAO) through the implementation of a tripartite\nagricultural cooperation mechanism agreed among FAO\nitself, Viet Nam and certain African countries has yielded\nencouraging results. We hope that on the basis of that\nexperience, the United Nations will focus more on\ndevelopment issues and create conditions that are more\nfavourable for providing assistance to the developing and\nless developed countries.\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the formation and\nexpansion of linkages among countries at the regional,\ninterregional, intercontinental and global levels. These\nmulti-level linkages among States also give rise to\nfavourable conditions for all nations to exploit their\ncomparative advantages, and they give impetus to\nincreased mutual assistance among various partners,\nwhich leads to more equitable and sustainable growth\nwithin each region as well as among regions.\nPeace, stability and development are closely\ninterrelated, like companions on the road to prosperity.\nOur own experience has taught us that a peaceful\nenvironment and political and social stability are\nindispensable for a nation to devote itself to achieving\neconomic development. In turn, a more developed\neconomy and improved living standards help strengthen\npolitical and social stability and thus preserve peace.\nTwo opposing tendencies have characterized the\nworld security situation since the fifty-second session. On\nthe one hand, numerous events have shown a continuing\ntrend of peace and improved relations among countries,\n28\n\n\nas evidenced by fact that the peaceful settlement of certain\ndecades-long conflicts is under way and that relations\namong nations, including major Powers, continue to\nimprove. On the other hand, we are witnessing on a daily\nbasis bloodshed and confrontation in many regions, from\nthe Middle East to Africa, from the Balkans to South Asia,\nand so on.\nThe arms race continues unabated. One terrorist act\nfollows on the heels of another. The list of countries to be\n\u201cpunished\u201d is not getting any shorter, and the direct victims\ncontinue to be the elderly and women and children. Our\nplanet is thus not yet out of the reach of the Damocles\nsword of insecurity.\nThe painful lessons of the twentieth century \u2014 a\ncentury replete with conflicts and wars, including the two\nWorld Wars, which claimed tens of millions of lives \u2014 and\nthe burning desire of humankind for a better life on the eve\nof the new century require that we all redouble our efforts\nto achieve a solid and lasting peace.\nIn today?s world, such a peace will be achieved only\nif every people and every State \u2014 large or small, rich or\npoor, wherever its location \u2014 make every effort in jointly\nworking towards it. Such a peace can be achieved only if\nit is based on a strict observance in international relations\nof the principle of respect for independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity; non-intervention in one another?s\ninternal affairs; the non-use or threat of use of force; and\nsanctions.\nSuch a peace will be established only when the goal\nof total disarmament is achieved, first and foremost through\nthe elimination of weapons of mass destruction. In this\nspirit, all States must put an end to the production, testing,\nstockpiling, proliferation, use or threat of use of these\nweapons.\nSouth-East Asia, as an integral part of the planet, is\naffected by current global developments. In these last 50\nyears, it has been a hotbed of conflicts and disputes and the\nscene of numerous bloody wars and crises. But today\nSouth-East Asia?s luck is changing, and an atmosphere of\npeace, stability and cooperation for development prevails.\nThe membership of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has increased, bringing it closer to\nits goal of 10 member countries and helping to put an end\nto the region?s historical divisions. The South-East Asia\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty has been signed.\nNevertheless, problems remain, including sovereignty\ndisputes in the South China Sea, that must be resolved in\norder to ensure peace and stability for all countries in the\nregion. We believe, however, that tensions can be avoided\nif all parties concerned practise self-restraint; refrain from\naggravating the situation; ensure freedom of international\nmaritime transportation; settle their disputes through\nnegotiation on the basis of respect for international law,\nparticularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea; and, in the immediate future, seek to\nidentify patterns of cooperation acceptable to all sides.\nThis is in line with the all-out efforts by the countries of\nthe region to build neighbourly relationships of friendship\nand cooperation based on the principle of mutual respect.\nIn this spirit, as Cambodia?s immediate neighbour,\nwe welcome the success beyond expectations of the\nCambodian elections last July, which were recognized to\nbe free and fair by the entire international community.\nWe sincerely hope that this will lead to the early\nformation of a new government in Cambodia that will set\nthe Cambodian people on the road to building and\ndeveloping their country in conditions of peace and\nstability.\nRegrettably, East Asia in general and South-East\nAsia in particular, reputed in past decades to be the\nworld?s most dynamic economic growth area, are\nsuffering an unprecedentedly serious crisis. This has led\ncertain people hastily to declare the demise of the miracle\nof the East Asian development model and even go so far\nas to reject \u201cAsian values\u201d. I would humbly suggest that\nsuch views are groundless. Indeed, the current crisis in\nEast Asia is neither the first nor the last in the history of\nthe market economy. Although some errors were made,\nthe East Asia and South-East Asia development model\nhas already provided quite a few valuable experiences and\nuseful lessons.\nAre not the virtues of studiousness, industriousness,\nthrift, intelligence, creativity and caring for one another\neternal and universal values? Moreover, there remain\nsubstantial economic foundations, unique cultures and the\nachievements of the people of the region realized thanks\nto their hard work and creativity \u2014 not to mention other\npositive factors, such as the region?s abundant natural\nresources, large internal market and major role in world\npolitics and economics.\nThe existence and growth of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been another\npositive factor in the development of South-East Asia.\nDespite difficulties and challenges, ASEAN continues to\n29\n\n\nbecome more unified, promote cooperation and play an\nactive role in Asia and the Pacific and the world, not only\nthrough intensive interactions with dialogue partners and\nother international and regional organizations, but also by\nmeans of its vigorous work in different multilateral forums:\nthe ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia/Europe Meeting, the\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the United Nations itself.\nAfter successfully hosting the seventh summit of the\nFrench-speaking community in November 1997, Viet Nam\nhas the great honour to again play host \u2014 this time to the\nsixth ASEAN Summit, which will be held in Hanoi this\nDecember. The Summit, whose theme will be strengthening\nunity and broadening cooperation for a South-East Asia of\npeace, stability and balanced development, will adopt the\nHanoi declaration and plan of action, which will guide\nSouth-East Asia as it enters the next century.\nAs a result of the factors I have outlined, we are\nfirmly convinced that South-East Asia will soon overcome\nits difficulties and regain its previous pace of growth, and\nthat the international community will continue to regard the\nregion as a promising and reliable partner.\nTo build peace and promote development, it is\nurgently important to reform the United Nations, to make\nit more democratic and better adapted to confront the\nprofound changes that have taken place in the world in the\n50 years since the Organization was founded. We all agree\nthat it is essential to reform the Security Council so that it\nwill be more democratic, more transparent and more\naccountable to the General Assembly, the biggest and most\nrepresentative forum of the community of nations. Viet\nNam and its Non-Aligned Movement partners are\ncommitted to the position that the developing countries\nshould be represented in the Security Council through\npermanent membership. In view of the legitimate interests\nof potential candidates, Viet Nam will support the rotation\nformula if a majority of countries accept it. Our country\nalso supports the proposed limiting of the right of the\nveto \u2014 prior to abolishing it \u2014 to decisions relating to\nissues provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThis year the international community will celebrate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. We have always regarded the Declaration\nas a great achievement of the world?s peoples in their long\nstruggle for fundamental rights, the most important of\nwhich are the right to live in peace, independence,\nprosperity and happiness, and with social justice, and the\nright to self-determination. It is unfortunate that the issue of\nhuman rights has sometimes been twisted to serve as a\npretext for intervening and interfering in other countries?\naffairs. In this regard, Viet Nam greatly appreciates the\nposition the Non-Aligned Movement expressed in the\nDurban Declaration, during its recent twelfth summit\nmeeting, that human rights should not\n\u201cbe used as a political instrument for interference in\ninternal affairs. ... They require an environment of\npeace and development, respect for sovereignty,\nterritorial integrity and non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of States. Socio-economic rights,\nincluding the right to development, are inextricably\npart of real human rights.\u201d\nHaving suffered humiliation under foreign domination,\nhaving been ridiculed and having sacrificed innumerable\nlives in order to regain their human rights and dignity,\nour people will spare no effort to hold on to the\nfundamental rights they have regained.\nTo achieve the objective of becoming a prosperous\npeople, a strong State and a just and developed society,\nthe Vietnamese people are, and will remain, resolved to\npursue their policy of renewal and to industrialize and\nmodernize the country. To do this and promote peace,\ncooperation and development, Viet Nam will continue to\npursue its foreign policy in support of independence,\nsovereignty, openness, multilateralism, diversification of\nforeign relations, and gradual global and regional\nintegration. Thus Viet Nam will always be an active\nmember of international and regional organizations. It will\ncontinue to contribute to the United Nations efforts for\npeace and development, particularly in its capacity as a\nnewly elected member of the Economic and Social\nCouncil.\nHumanity enters the new millennium with earnest\nhopes for a better and more prosperous life. At this\nhistoric turning point, we expect the United Nations to\nmake greater efforts to achieve lasting peace and a\nclimate of international cooperation supportive of the\ndevelopment of every nation. Viet Nam will spare no\neffort to contribute fully to the achievement of that lofty\ngoal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly provides us\nonce again with an opportunity to look at the overall\nsituation in the world and to reflect together on the future\nof the peoples and the nations that we represent.\nBut first of all, may I extend to Mr. Didier Opertti our\nwarm and sincere congratulations on his well-deserved\nelection, which is but recognition of his intellectual and\npersonal qualities and which, I am certain, will ensure the\nsuccess of the work of this session. We would like also to\npay a warm tribute to his predecessor, who presided so\nbrilliantly over the work of the previous session.\nMy delegation is pleased to express appreciation for\nthe courageous and ongoing work being carried out by\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, in support of\npeace in the world and particularly on the African\ncontinent.\nWhen on 25 July 1996 we had to carry out a very\nradical change of government in Burundi, the political\nsituation was an explosive one. Every day Burundians\nwere dying without really knowing why, and the threat of\ngenocide and widespread chaos was a very real danger.\nI shall not go into the details of that situation, as the\nSecurity Council, the Secretary-General and his\nrepresentative in Bujumbura have followed on a daily\nbasis the evolution of the crisis which has in recent years\ndisrupted my country.\nSince that change on 25 July 1996, we have stated\nclearly that restoration of security and the beginning of a\npeace process are our basic concerns.\nThis fifty-third session provides me with an\nopportunity to tell you about the efforts made by the\npeople of Burundi, its leaders and the international\ncommunity to attain our goals of restoring a lasting peace\nin the country. Despite some acts of terrorism, I can say\nto this Assembly that security has now been fully restored\nin Burundi. The threat of genocide so feared by its people\nis gone today. Two years ago the peace process was\ninitiated; it is now under way and proceeding in a manner\nsatisfactory to all those concerned. I should like to focus\nmy statement today on this peace project.\n\n\nThe idea of a peace-process project in Burundi is\nbased on the realization that despite the ethnic turn taken by\nviolence which brought such tragedy to my country over\nthe last five years, the underlying cause of the Burundi\ncrisis is essentially a political one. That is why we are\nfocusing our efforts on seeking a political solution to the\ncrisis.\nTwo years ago we set in motion a peace process\nwhich was divided into two aspects: the internal aspect and\nthe external aspect. At the internal level, the dynamic\nprovided by the peace process led to a domestic agreement\non political partnership. Two years ago, the Government\nwhich emerged from the change of 25 July 1996 and the\nNational Assembly elected in 1993 began a dialogue geared\ntowards a political rapprochement. This initiative led to an\nagreement on political partnership.\nToday, we have a provisional constitution which came\nout of that partnership and which governs the institutions of\nour Republic, primarily the Government and the National\nAssembly. In Burundi, the political partnership is a reality\nnot only between Government and the National Assembly\nbut also with the majority of the registered political parties\nand the representatives of civil society who have joined the\npartnership for peace. It is within this framework that a\nnegotiated Government, bringing together the main political\nforces in the country, is now in place and has been\nfunctioning for three months. The National Assembly\nelected in 1993 has been expanded to include\nrepresentatives of other registered political parties and\nrepresentatives of civil society.\nI can say to this Assembly \u2014 and those who have\nvisited Burundi recently have been able to note this\nthemselves \u2014 that this partnership has transformed, and\ncontinues to transform, the political landscape in Burundi\nin a positive way. Today, the political class within our\ncountry is organizing a wide-ranging discussion on the\npartnership to enable the people of Burundi to absorb the\nidea of peace, the ultimate objective being stabilization of\nthe country through the restoration of peace.\nThe Government, for its part, is preparing its\nprogramme based on the political agreement which emerged\nfrom the partnership. The major issues, such as democracy,\njustice, security and development, are in the forefront of\nthis programme which the Government will be submitting\nto the parliament at its next session in October. My\nGovernment is determined to continue consolidating the\npartnership within the country. We deeply believe that this\napproach can establish the bases for an overall agreement\nassociating our compatriots living abroad with our peace\nproject.\nIt was the existence of this political partnership at\nthe domestic level which made possible the beginning of\na process of global negotiations involving Burundians\nabroad in the peace process. The negotiations, bringing\ntogether people of Burundi living at home and abroad,\nbegan on 15 June 1998 in Arusha, in the United Republic\nof Tanzania. The second negotiating session took place on\n20 July, and the third meeting is scheduled for 12\nOctober. These negotiations are proceeding in a manner\nsatisfactory to all the participants: the Burundians, the\nfacilitator and the representatives of the international\ncommunity.\nI should like to declare that the Government of\nBurundi is resolved to do its utmost to assure the success\nof these negotiations. We divided the peace process into\ntwo aspects, domestic and external, because it is simply\na question of methodology. The peace process is one and\nindivisible. First of all, we wanted to get the people of\nBurundi involved in the peace process before the Arusha\nnegotiations, so that we could take into consideration the\nrecent experience of our subregion. Peace negotiations\nwhich do not involve the people often take a tragic turn.\nI should like to declare from this rostrum that the\npeace process is now under way to the satisfaction of the\npeople of Burundi. We are determined to resolve through\ndialogue the dispute pitting Burundians one against the\nother. Unfortunately, there are obstacles along our path\ntowards lasting peace, the main one being the economic\nsanctions imposed on Burundi on 31 July 1996. These\neconomic sanctions affect in particular the most\nvulnerable sectors of our society. They are destroying the\neconomic and social fabric of the country and over the\nlong term are jeopardizing stabilization over the long term\nin our country. In fact, the impact of the embargo on the\npeople of Burundi is devastating. Let me give you a few\nfigures: grade school attendance has dropped from 70 to\n43 per cent; the vaccination rate has plummeted from 80\nto 40 per cent and malnutrition among children under the\nage of 5 is now 43 per cent.\nMoreover, the embargo imposed on Burundi is now\nenriching a few individuals in the country in a scandalous\nmanner and is tragically impoverishing millions of people\nthere. This embargo is eroding trust between the\nmediators and the parties to the conflict, particularly the\nGovernment of Burundi. Even though all the conditions\nimposed by those who initiated the embargo have now\nbeen met, the economic sanctions are still being\n2\n\n\nmaintained. Today there is absolutely no justification, moral\nor political, for continuing the embargo against Burundi.\nI would appeal to the countries of our subregion and\nto the mediator organizing the negotiations in Arusha to lift\nthe embargo before it definitively torpedoes our peace\nproject. Our appeal is also directed to the international\ncommunity for support in our effort at peace-building in\nBurundi.\nWe must act now to concert our peace efforts.\nTomorrow will be too late. Those who have sinned by\nomission will bear an important responsibility.\nThe other significant obstacle to peace in Burundi is\nthe continuing violence perpetrated by armed factions based\nin the territories of certain neighbouring countries. I call on\nthose countries to assume their share of the responsibility.\nOne cannot both call for negotiations and tolerate terrorist\nactions by armed groups without jeopardizing the entire\npeace process. For negotiations to begin, there must be a\ncessation of hostilities.\nBurundi, a landlocked country under economic\nsanctions, needs international solidarity. Humanitarian\nassistance must be stepped up in order to help those\nafflicted by this crisis. We would wish to see international\ncooperation with our country resumed without further delay.\nSecurity conditions are no worse in Burundi than in the\nother countries of the Great Lakes region. Burundians\nsimply ask to be treated fairly. Our commitment and\nresolve to achieve peace in Burundi through dialogue must\nno longer be called into question. The facts today speak for\nthemselves. We are negotiating with all Burundians who\nhave political demands.\nMy country?s domestic concerns will not allow me to\nforget the other problems afflicting Africa and the world.\nFar from it.\nAt this time of globalization, a sustained effort must\nbe made by the international community to promote\nbalanced development throughout the world. Africa\ndeserves special attention. If one advocates development\nthrough trade, then one must also increase official\ndevelopment assistance to stimulate the growth of\neconomies that remain fragile. Africa is being crushed by\nthe weight of its debt. The burden must be eased and\neliminated for the poorest countries. Globalization without\nsolidarity with the poorest nations will not lead to a\npeaceful world.\nIn order to adapt to inevitable changes, the\ndeveloping countries must organize themselves. Here, I\nenvision the creation of regional areas of integration that\nwill make our economies viable. We are in favour of\nregional integration, but one that respects the identity and\nsovereignty of each country. We are opposed to regional\nintegration that includes the domination and hegemony of\nthe most powerful.\nRegional economic integration can be achieved,\nhowever, only in secure regions. Our region of the Great\nLakes remains subject to extreme instability. This cyclical\ninsecurity has endured for decades and has unleashed\nfloods of refugees. Entire defeated armies move through\nthe region, which has already experienced an\nunprecedented genocide.\nWe continue to follow very carefully the evolution\nof the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nI wish to reaffirm that our country, Burundi, is in no way\ninvolved in that conflict. However, we remain concerned,\non the one hand, by a certain tenor of statement that pits\npeoples against peoples on the basis of ethnic identity;\nand, on the other, by militias and certain rebels, whom we\nin the region remember only too well. I would urge all\nparticipants in this conflict not to allow themselves to be\nentrapped and led down that road, because it leads only\nto danger that could engulf the entire region in flames.\nBurundi will continue to ensure that its security is\nnot destabilized. To that end, we shall take all appropriate\nmeasures. We continue to advocate peaceful means and\ndialogue to resolve this conflict. If the Government of\nBurundi is asked to contribute to a political solution, it\nwill be very happy to do so.\nIn Burundi, we believe that the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and the United Nations should coordinate\ntheir efforts more effectively in seeking a solution to the\ncrisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nparticularly when we consider the limitations of\nsubregional organizations.\nAt the global level, every region of our planet faces\nvarying degrees of environmental degradation, terrorism,\nendemic disease, drug abuse and hunger, to mention only\nthe most widespread threats. To cope with this situation,\nthe United Nations will have to play a decisive role. Our\nOrganization has, in the past, demonstrated its strengths\nand its weaknesses.\nTo take up these many challenges, the United\nNations must open itself up and become more democratic\n3\n\n\nif it is to become more effective in addressing the realities\nof the modern world. In order better to resolve the\nproblems of peace, the Security Council should be\njudiciously expanded to include other Members of the\nOrganization.\nWithin the United Nations, Burundi will continue to\nraise its modest voice against terrorism and the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, and in favour of allocating\ngreater resources to combat poverty and encourage\neducation and health, particularly in developing\ncountries \u2014 in short, to build a more balanced and fairer\nworld. In our view, this is the challenge facing our\nOrganization as we approach the new millennium.\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nI am confident that the skills and vast experience you have\nacquired throughout your distinguished diplomatic career\nwill provide the guidance we need to guarantee the\nsuccessful outcome of the session. I must also recall the\nvaluable contribution of your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, to the work of the last session of the General\nAssembly.\nThis year, 1998, has been a year of warning signals\nand signs of hope. We have witnessed both setbacks and\nstrides forward in the quest for peace and international\nsecurity. In particular, we have witnessed great progress\ntowards the settlement of one of the longest and most\nintractable conflicts \u2014 that of Northern Ireland. The Irish\npeace agreement has proved to the world that it is never\ntoo late to find answers to seemingly impossible\nproblems.\nUnfortunately, wars, armed conflicts, acts of\nterrorism and other forms of violence have shaken the\nworld during this last year and have had a negative\nimpact on international stability and security.\nA party to all international treaties in the sphere of\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nArmenia is deeply concerned about the possible\nconsequences of nuclear tests conducted by India and\nPakistan this year. We believe that as the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) comes into force, it will\ncontribute substantially to the strengthening of\ninternational security. Also, within the framework of the\nConference on Disarmament, Armenia supports drafting\nagreements on the prohibition of the production of fissile\nmaterials for nuclear weapons and other explosive\ndevices.\nThe United Nations plays a great role in different\naspects of international life, ranging from tackling global\nenvironmental problems to combating organized crime\nand illicit drug trafficking. In support of United Nations\nactivities in these spheres, Armenia actively participated\nin the twentieth special session of the General Assembly.\n\n\nWe strongly believe that the illicit traffic in drugs and\npsychotropic substances seriously jeopardizes the economic\nprosperity and political stability of many countries and\nregions of the world.\nArmenia also actively participated in activities leading\nto the establishment of the International Criminal Court,\nsince we attach great importance to the battle against\ninternational crime, including the crime of genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity and war crimes. Believing that the United\nNations should play the leading role in the formation of an\ninternational anti-criminal strategy, Armenia supports the\nidea of holding, in Vienna, in the year 2000, the tenth\nUnited Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and\nTreatment of Offenders.\nArmenia unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism\nas acts that have no justification on political, ideological,\nethnic, religious or any other grounds. The recent terrorist\nattacks in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania once\nagain show us the necessity for cooperation among all\ncountries to combat that evil. We call for the accession of\nthe maximum number of countries to universal conventions\nagainst terrorism, and support the Russian proposal on a\nUnited Nations convention for combating acts of nuclear\nterrorism. Armenia likewise supports including on the\nagenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly\nissues dealing with the declaration by the United Nations of\na decade of international law, as well as events to be\norganized in 1999 devoted to the hundredth anniversary of\nthe first International Peace Conference.\nFor the international community, this year marks the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The semi-centennial anniversary of the Declaration\nenables the States Members of the United Nations to\nconduct a review of human rights conditions in their own\ncountries and to identify ways further to develop the\nfoundations of democracy and to promote human and\nnational rights.\nThis year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is well known that\nthe international community did not, at the time, duly\ncondemn the genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman\nEmpire in 1915, and that failure encouraged certain regimes\nto commit new crimes of genocide. After the Holocaust, the\nUnited Nations addressed the problem of genocide, defining\nit as a crime against humanity, and adopted, on 9 December\n1948, the aforementioned Convention. Despite that fact,\nover the past five decades, crimes of genocide have been\ncommitted in various parts of the world on more than one\noccasion. The recent recognition and condemnation by\nseveral parliaments of the genocide of Armenians\ncommitted early in this century is evidence of an\nincreased understanding of the necessity to combat that\nevil.\nThe General Assembly, upon the submission of\nArmenia and five other Member States, included on the\nagenda of this session an item on the fiftieth anniversary\nof the genocide Convention. We hope that, by combining\nits efforts in the struggle against the crime of genocide,\nhumanity will take a decisive step towards the elimination\nof that crime in the next century.\nEquality and mutually beneficial cooperation among\ncountries in the political and commercial-economic\nspheres, based on free market principles, should become\nan important factor for political stability in the third\nmillennium. We have no other choice. Armenia adheres\nto this policy in all its dealings, from its approach to\ncooperation with international organizations to the process\nof becoming a member of the World Trade Organization.\nWe attach special significance to regional\ncooperation, be it in the framework of the Commonwealth\nof Independent States, the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation organization or the TRASECA project.\nArmenia is sincerely open to such cooperation, although\nwe have to state with regret that the blockade imposed on\nArmenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan is a serious obstacle\nto such cooperation. It is obvious that the region?s vast\npotential cannot be fully exploited if attempts are made to\nisolate one of its constituents. Such attempts are doomed\nto failure.\nAnother factor of concern for political-military\nstability in the region is the gross violation by Azerbaijan\nof the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.\nIn three categories of ground equipment identified in the\nTreaty, our neighbour significantly surpasses the national\nlimits set by the Treaty.\nDespite the potential threat to our security, since the\nearliest days of our independence we have clearly and\nunambiguously forsworn the development of weapons of\nmass destruction and adhere to the principles of non-\nproliferation of such weapons and of control over the\ndestabilizing accumulation of conventional arms.\nThe peaceful settlement of regional conflicts is one\nof the most important safeguards of stability and peace in\nour region, the Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to\n2\n\n\nthe ceasefire established in the Karabakh zone of conflict in\nMay 1994 and will assist in its rigorous maintenance. We\nemphasize the contribution of the Minsk Group and of its\nindividual member States, both to the maintenance of the\nceasefire and to mediation.\nUnfortunately, at present, the negotiation process is at\nan impasse. We believe that the main reasons for this\nimpasse are the unclear definition of Nagorny Karabakh?s\nstatus as a party to the negotiations; Azerbaijan?s refusal to\nnegotiate directly with the leaders of Nagorny Karabakh;\nand its insistence on preconditions regarding the future\nstatus of Nagorny Karabakh, which we believe must be\nnegotiated. The international community must make every\neffort to overcome these obstacles.\nIn our opinion, given the intensity and specifics of the\nNagorny Karabakh conflict, its resolution demands\nunconventional approaches based on the principle of equal\nlegal rights for the parties to the conflict, an end to the\nenclave status of Nagorny Karabakh and the provision of\ninternational security guarantees for its population. Armenia\nis ready to move forward and calls on Azerbaijan to resume\nnegotiations without preconditions in order to reach a\ncomprehensive settlement for the Nagorny Karabakh\nconflict.\nThe challenges that the international community faces\ntoday are diverse and complicated. We are convinced that\nonly a reformed United Nations can cope successfully and\neffectively with the increasing number of problems. This\nholds true especially for the reform of the Security Council,\nsince the maintenance of peace and security throughout the\nworld depends on a Security Council that functions\neffectively. We also call for deeper institutional reform of\nthe United Nations, including in the administrative-\nbudgetary sphere. We believe that the fulfilment by all\nMember States of their financial obligations under the\nUnited Nations Charter is indispensable if the\nOrganization?s acute financial crisis is to be overcome.\nDespite serious economic hardships, Armenia will fulfil its\nduties in this sphere. We need only recognize that a\nstronger and reformed United Nations serves our common\ninterests.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Thank you very much, Sir. But I\nprefer to be called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flight-Lieutenant\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nI join preceding speakers in congratulating the\nPresident and the other members of the Bureau on your\nelection to direct the affairs of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am indeed very confident that under\nyour wise leadership the outcome of our deliberations will\nconstitute a great step forward in our efforts to build a new\nworld which meets the aspirations of our peoples in the\nsearch for peace, justice and prosperity.\nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to express\nthe deep appreciation of my delegation for the remarkable\nachievements of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, under whose\nable guidance the Assembly at the preceding session took\nvery important decisions on United Nations reform\nintended to prepare the Organization for the immense\nchallenges ahead as we move into the twenty-first\ncentury.\nIn these laudable efforts, we also recognize the bold\ninitiatives and drive of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, whose vision for the future of the United Nations,\ncorresponding so much with that of the general\nmembership and the peoples of the world, facilitated the\ncontinuing process of reform. We in Ghana and indeed in\nAfrica are proud to have for a son a man of his stature\nand drive.\nThe commemoration this year of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\naffords us the opportunity to take stock of what has been\nachieved over the years and map out well-defined\nstrategies to improve the quality of life of our peoples, by\neffectively promoting and protecting their fundamental\nrights, which the Declaration holds as a common standard\nof achievement for all people and all nations.\nWomen\u00e2s rights must be at the centre of that process\nand we should remain focused on their worldwide\npromotion and protection. It is their right. It is our\nobligation. The work of the United Nations in\nstrengthening the equal status and the human rights of\nwomen, from the World Conference on Human Rights to\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, is indeed\ncommendable.\nAlmost fifty years after the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, 12 million children under\nfive years of age die every year from preventable\ndiseases, 200 million children under five years of age are\nundernourished and 110 million are denied basic\neducation. Eight hundred million people have no access\nto the most basic health services, and 1.3 billion human\nbeings live in abject poverty around the world. This state\nof affairs persists because of the inequitable international\neconomic system which discriminates against a\ndeveloping world, particularly Africa.\n\nThe persistent critical economic situation in Africa\nshould be of great concern to the international community\nand should prompt us all to take effective and urgent\nmeasures to address its underlying causes. Many of our\ncountries, particularly the poorer ones, continue to suffer\nfrom a heavy debt burden and crippling debt-servicing\n4\n\n\nobligations, which, by diverting resources away from\ndevelopment, prevent us from providing adequate social\nservices to our populations in basic areas such as education\nand health and therefore reduce our capacity to compete in\nthe global market.\nIn this regard, we stress the need for debt-relief\nmeasures to be accompanied by concessional financial\nassistance, particularly to the least developed countries, with\nthe aim of enhancing the implementation of economic\nreforms and creating a stable environment that enables\ncountries to extricate themselves from the debt overhang.\nThe international reverberations of the recent financial\nturmoil in Asia and elsewhere, I believe, point to the futility\nof any notions that any nation can play outside the rules,\nthat any nation in this world can stand alone.\nIn my view, the present approach of certain\nindustrialized countries who require developing countries to\nadhere to standards or policies which they themselves do\nnot observe, or seem unable to observe, will severely test\nrelations between the developed and the developing\ncountries in the next century.\nWe must stand together if we are not to jeopardize the\nprosperity enjoyed by hundreds of millions today and the\nhopes of billions more for a life of dignity and a healthy\nmeasure of comfort \u00e2\u20ac\u201d nothing more, nothing less.\nThe new times we live in require new ideas suitable\nto the dynamics of today. Policy makers and opinion\nleaders in the developed countries bear great responsibility\nin this regard, as we all do, for providing very clear\nleadership of integrity. Much is demanded of those\ncountries that share a great part of the blame for the present\nstate of the world, as they no doubt have the means to be\nable to provide what it takes.\nEven though it had been clear for some time that\nsustainable development around the globe could not be\nachieved without a measure of fairness in economic\nrelations between North and South, because of short-term\nconsiderations of profit and advantage, the countries\nbenefiting from the unjust economic order chose to ignore\nthe serious impact of that situation on living standards in\nmost parts of the world as well as in limiting world\neconomic growth.\nInstead, we received sermons on the truths, realities\nand moralities of life, and countries and peoples were\nvictimized if they were shown not to have lived up to\nexpectations. That was the price, in other words, that we\nhad to pay. It was obvious, however, that whenever a\nsituation required moral leadership from the capitals of\nthose countries which preached morality in the first place,\nthat morality manifested itself as no more than national\ninterest.\nNo one questions the need for States to look out for\ntheir national interests. However, it is the blindness to the\nneed for enlightened self-interest that has lain at the heart\nof the divisions between our States for so long, and which\nhas finally shaken the economic confidence of people,\nwhether in the North or the South, in recent times.\nThe end of the cold war has unleashed new threats\nto global and regional peace. Intra-State conflicts, rooted\nin ethnic, racial and religious intolerance, pose a threat to\nthe security of many States and regions. The tardiness and\nselectivity of the international community in dealing with\nsome of these conflict situations have been rather\ndisturbing, as they have undermined the concept of\ncollective security enshrined in our noble Charter. Article\n24 of the Charter not only confers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primary\nresponsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for the maintenance of international peace\nand security on the Security Council, but also calls for\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153prompt and effective action\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when a breach occurs.\nHowever, in our part of the world, we often ask ourselves\nwhere the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prompt and effective\u00e2\u20ac\u009d action of the Council\nwas when Rwanda was on fire. Where was the Council\nwhen Liberia was in turmoil? Where was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prompt and\neffective action\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when the people of Sierra Leone\nagonized under the yoke of a brutal dictatorship?\nIn the face of the selectivity of the Security Council\nin dealing with issues of international peace and security,\nand in spite of our region\u00e2s meagre resources, we have\nhad to rely on our own efforts to respond to internal strife\nin some of the countries in our neighbourhood. We call\non the Governments of those countries to remain steadfast\nin making sacrifices and doing everything possible to\nbring about national reconciliation, peace and stability.\nThe international situation continues to be poisoned\nby unilateral economic, commercial and financial\nsanctions, which in some cases even have extraterritorial\nconsequences.\nWe have seen such actions undermine the positive\nsocio-economic gains made by Cuba over the last few\ndecades, with the resultant deprivation of an entire\npopulation\u00e2s human rights and dignity. The world stands\nto gain from a peaceful solution to the differences\nbetween the United States and Cuba, and we call on the\n5\n\n\nUnited States to settle its differences with Cuba through\nnegotiations on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\nWe are equally concerned by the effect of the\nimposition of sanctions by the Security Council against the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya. However, we are extremely\npleased with the recent developments concerning the\npossible trial of the two suspects in the bombing of Pan\nAm flight 103 over Lockerbie.\nWe call upon the United Kingdom, the United States\nof America and the Netherlands to engage in discussions\nwith the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, directly or through the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, to arrive at trial\narrangements which will offer appropriate safety measures\nfor the two suspects.\nOn Western Sahara, we call on the Security Council\nand the Secretary-General to continue their efforts for a\npeaceful and just solution to the persistent outstanding\ndifferences and for a free and fair referendum. We will not\nhave a neighbouring African country recolonized by another\nAfrican country.\nGhana shares the concerns and frustrations of the\ninternational community on the deadlock over the Middle\nEast peace process. We believe that initiatives taken so far\nin support of the process, including the Madrid and the\nOslo agreements, as well as the principle of land for peace,\nare an adequate basis for a just and long-lasting settlement.\nThe international community is unanimous in its\ndetermination to see a just peace in the Middle East, and\nthe Palestinian question no doubt holds the key.\nMy delegation\u00e2s condemnation of all forms and\nmanifestations of terrorism and mercenary practices is\nrooted no doubt in their tragic consequences on the political\nstability as well as the economic and social development of\nStates. Terrorist acts, in particular, are totally unacceptable\nas a means of seeking redress for any grievance, achieving\npolitical ends or supporting a cause. It is in this connection\nthat we have condemned the recent terrorist bomb attacks\nin Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam that claimed hundreds of\ninnocent lives, injured thousands of people and caused\nmassive destruction to property, as well as the persistent\nthreat to Americans around the world.\nI am proud to say that since joining this Organization\non 8 March 1957, only two days after acceding to\nindependence, Ghana has remained true to its commitments\nto contribute to the promotion of international peace and\nsecurity, the principal raison d\u00e2\u00c3\u00aatre of this Organization.\nOnly three years after independence, in 1960, my country,\nGhana, responded to the call of the Organization and\ncommitted troops and resources to the United Nations\npeacekeeping operation in what was then the Belgian\nCongo, now the Democratic People\u00e2s Republic of the\nCongo.\nWe have since remained actively engaged,\nconsistently participating in the peace efforts of the\nOrganization, in all regions of the globe. As I speak,\nGhana is listed as one of the major contributors of troops\nto United Nations peacekeeping efforts, with personnel\nserving in eight United Nations missions in Africa,\nEurope, Asia and the Middle East.\nThe Government and people of Ghana are indeed\nproud of our participation in these international peace\nefforts, even though it has been at great expense to our\ndeveloping country. It is not a sacrifice in material\nresources alone, but also in human terms, as Ghana, as\nwell as her neighbours, has lost her sons and daughters in\nthese operations.\nWe welcome the adoption last year of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction. My country was among the large\nnumber that signed the Convention in Ottawa last\nDecember, and it is in the process of its early ratification.\nWe hope that conditions will, in the not-too-distant future,\npermit the Convention\u00e2s universal adoption, to enable us\nto rid our planet of these inhumane weapons which\ncontinue to kill and maim innocent civilians long after the\nconflicts in which they were laid. We are sincerely of the\nview that the international community should pay greater\nattention to demining and rehabilitation, because of the\nhavoc that the presence of mines wreaks on the\neconomies of the affected countries as well as on the\ncontribution of millions of peasants towards the feeding\nof their families.\nThe United Nations Diplomatic Conference of\nPlenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International\nCriminal Court, convened in Rome in June and July this\nyear, is a welcome development in our collective effort to\nprovide a legal and institutional framework to hold\nperpetrators accountable for genocide, crimes against\nhumanity, war crimes and serious violations of\ninternational humanitarian law. It is our sincere hope that\nthe spirit of compromise that led to the overwhelming\nendorsement of the Rome treaty will similarly be brought\nto bear on the work of the Preparatory Commission, to\nensure the early establishment of a fully functional and\neffective court.\n6\n\n\nOnce again Ghana has the unpleasant task of joining\nothers to express concern at the financial situation that\npersists in the Organization, characterized by very little\ncash and huge arrears. The persistent critical financial\nsituation places our Organization in jeopardy at this time of\nreform. It is regrettable that a number of States are neither\npaying their assessed contributions nor making full payment\nof their arrears, while some persistently aggravate the\nsituation by attaching unreasonable as well as unacceptable\nconditions or benchmarks to the discharge of their Charter\nobligations. In this respect, let me admit that there are very\nsmall but extremely rich countries among us who could\nhave helped without making a dent in their national wealth\nand resources.\nSupport for the United Nations must be demonstrated\nnot in pious proclamations but in the willingness of all\nMember States to meet Charter obligations to the\nOrganization, including payment of our contributions to\nensure that the Organization is put on a sound financial\nfooting to tackle its mandates and pressing commitments.\nI wish to conclude by expressing once more my\ndelegation\u00e2s appreciation to the Secretary-General and to\nthe Assembly for the comprehensive reforms being\nundertaken to restructure, revitalize and democratize the\nUnited Nations. I congratulate most sincerely the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Assembly on their achievements so far.\nAnd I assure you that my delegation, my country, will\ncontinue to work with you in this reform process and in all\naspects of the Organization\u00e2s work in order to ensure that\nthe Organization continues in the twenty-first century to\nbetter serve the global community and generations yet to\ncome in the maintenance and enhancement of our collective\nsecurity and the promotion of international cooperation to\nadvance the economic and social well-being of all our\npeoples.\nThat happens to be the vision of the founding fathers\nof the United Nations. And this is our commitment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We join in the call for the\nmost generous assistance to them all. Several of the\ncountries suffering severe damage and devastation \u2014 such\nas Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Saint Kitts and Nevis and\nthe Virgin Islands \u2014 are AOSIS members, and we have\nthem especially in our thoughts at this time.\nFor our small island States, these climate-related\nevents are occurring with alarming force and regularity.\nWe have it from the experts that powerful hurricanes like\nGeorges could be linked to the \u201ccold event\u201d of La Ni\u00f1a,\nthe contrasting weather phenomenon to El Ni\u00f1o, and that\nLa Ni\u00f1a may be setting conditions favourable to more\nfrequent and dangerous Caribbean hurricanes like\nGeorges. These were the same events described by the\nPrime Minister of Papua New Guinea in his address to\nthis Assembly last week, when he spoke of the damaging\neffects of El Ni\u00f1o, and by the Deputy Prime Minister of\nFiji earlier today. They are events and disasters which\ndemonstrate and underscore the extreme exposure and\nvulnerability of our island communities.\nAOSIS welcomed the action authorized by this\nAssembly last year towards early understanding of the El\nNi\u00f1o phenomenon and its impacts, and we fully support\nthe United Nations system-wide strategy now being\ndeveloped. We welcome in particular the proposals\ninitiated by the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) to reduce the impact of environmental\nemergencies through early warning and preparedness,\nespecially in the case of El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation. We\nnote in this connection the importance of practical support\nfor such initiatives, especially the generous financial\ndonation from the Ted Turner Foundation.\nIn Barbados in 1994, at the Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, the international community recognized their\nspecial characteristics and needs and adopted a specific\nProgramme of Action to address these needs. The United\nNations Agenda for Development, adopted last year,\nreinforced the acknowledgement of special circumstances\nand stressed the need for international support to help\nisland communities with their development efforts.\nThe months ahead will be a critical time for our\ncountries as we work towards the first five-year review of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action next year at the two-\nday special session of the General Assembly. The review\nwill be carried out against the background of the appraisal\nof Agenda 21 and the assessment arrived at by the\nworld?s political leadership then that the overall trends\nwith respect to sustainable development are worse today\nthan they were in 1992.\nThe conclusions of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment (CSD) at its sixth session earlier this year,\nwhich reviewed several chapters of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action, highlighted the continued\n7\n\n\nvulnerability of small island developing States, particularly\nto climate change, and the critical need for capacity-\nbuilding in such areas as the management of wastes;\nfreshwater biological resources; and science and technology.\nPlacing priority on human resource development and the\ntransfer of appropriate environmentally sound technologies\nare essential. Our national institutions and administrative\ncapacities have been hampered by a severe lack of financial\nand technical skills, and the use of regional institutions and\nmechanisms for coordination needs to be strengthened or\nsupplemented.\nWe look forward to engaging the international\ncommunity in detailed dialogue on these aspects at the\ndonors? conference next February and during the other\nreview preparatory processes next year. In doing so, let\nthere be no doubt about our own determination in the\nmatter, for the primary responsibility for the success of the\nBarbados Programme of Action lies with the small island\ndeveloping States, first and foremost. We will not be\nsidetracked from the ultimate prize of self-reliance, but we\nmust be assured of the vital support of the international\ncommunity.\nThe AOSIS countries continue to set high priority on\nthe development of the vulnerability index and will follow\nwith close attention the quantitative and analytical work\nwhich we believe must continue on the index. Recognition\nwithin the Barbados Programme of Action that small island\ndeveloping States are a special case is further supported by\nthe work of the ad hoc expert group on vulnerability\nindices, which reported to the Economic and Social Council\nearlier in the year. AOSIS takes particular note of the\nconclusion of the experts that, as a group, small island\nStates are more vulnerable than other groups of developing\ncountries.\nLooking to 1999 and the work of the Commission on\nSustainable Development, we warmly welcome the election\nof the Minister of Environment of New Zealand, The\nHonourable Simon Upton, as Chairman of the CSD at its\nseventh session and look forward to a successful year of\nconsultations under his leadership.\nThe agenda for the Commission?s seventh session is\nfull and an extremely important one: oceans, our heritage;\nsustainable tourism, so important to our future; and patterns\nof consumption and production, for we know all too well\nthe need to change if our children are to have adequate and\nright choices for their own future. We hope that all States\nwill take full advantage of the continued constructive\ndialogue that we have had in the past and which we expect\nduring the Commission?s seventh session and the\npreparations for the review of the Barbados Programme\nof Action. The special session next year will provide an\nexcellent opportunity to agree on the next steps to\nimplement the Programme of Action, and to explore in a\nfocused way the many difficulties which remain.\nIt is no accident that the first chapter of the\nBarbados Programme of Action deals with climate change\nand that it leads off with a clear statement that small\nisland developing States are particularly vulnerable to\nclimate change, climate variability and sea-level rise.\nIndeed, the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) is that small island States are the\nleast able to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\nWe remain at the front line of this issue, an issue\nnot of our making, and one that calls for urgent and\nconcerted international action. With the passing of each\nseason, small island States experience ever more serious\nimpacts, and practical steps must now be taken to assist\nthem, especially with the adaptation options that are\navailable. The impacts of climate change put at risk\nhabitats and fresh-water reserves, the very life force of\nour islands and communities, and thus the need for\nAOSIS to restate once again our profound concerns.\nAs the globe suffers what is on track to be the\nhottest year in recorded history, it is essential that the\ninternational community as a whole be formally and\nunequivocally reminded that neither the efforts made thus\nfar in implementing the Framework\nConvention on Climate Change nor the emissions\nreduction targets, on average 5.2 per cent, adopted in\nKyoto last year, represent an adequate effort to stabilize\ngreenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at safe\nlevels. We know from the IPCC reports that we need to\ndo much more, and to do it immediately, by cuts of\nemissions of up to 60 per cent and more.\nThere is emerging scientific evidence, supported by\nexperience in almost every part of the world, that climate\nchange is indeed taking effect, with devastating impacts,\nfrom the forest fires of South-East Asia to the extra\nsevere and unprecedented flooding in China and\nBangladesh, to the blistering heat of the American\nsummer. These events, backed by science, must continue\nto drive the development of the Convention and the\nKyoto Protocol.\nDeveloped country parties have an acknowledged\nhistorical role and remain primarily responsible for the\n8\n\n\naccumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and\nthey must be the first to accept the responsibility to redress\nthe situation. They possess the skills and the capacity\neffectively to do so now.\nIt is not sufficient per se to point to the new\nmechanisms created by the Kyoto Protocol, for there are\nnumerous uncertainties concerning the new mechanisms.\nThey are supplemental to domestic actions and they need\nrules for governance and compliance. Nor is it sufficient to\nsay that developed country actions are conditional on\ndeveloping country commitments. In the judgement of the\nAOSIS countries, such commitments must be allowed to\nevolve over time and in line with a common but\ndifferentiated principle, as well as the other fundamental\nprinciples of the Convention.\nThere cannot be any doubt as to the major importance\nof the first steps taken in Kyoto, and of the quantum\nimprovements brought about by the provisions of the\nProtocol. Notwithstanding the uncertainties I have referred\nto, we see a clear obligation on all parties to make every\ngenuine effort towards early entry into force of the Kyoto\nProtocol and the implementation of its provisions. The size\nand the urgency of the problem require this of us all. It is\nthe intent of the AOSIS countries to apply themselves in\nevery positive and constructive way to help clarify such\nuncertainties. In this manner, we have submitted our\nsuggestions and proposals in respect of several agenda\nitems and in connection with the preparations for the fourth\nconference of the parties in Buenos Aires.\nWe would need to acknowledge that the science on\nclimate change is imperfect and incomplete. But the fact\nthat we do not know everything is not a reason for ignoring\nthe evidence which does exist. In this connection, we are\nconcerned by the actions of certain industry interests which\nseem yet again to be determined on undermining the\nexisting credible and universally acknowledged scientific\nfindings, findings of the IPCC and others on this matter,\nand so to work in a negative way to influence public\nopinion. Climate change is far too serious and too urgent a\nconcern for all humanity to be the subject of such\nmanipulation.\nMay I now turn briefly to address some additional\nissues which are of particular importance to my country,\nSamoa. First, we are deeply grateful to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General, for his leadership and for the reform\nprocess he has initiated. Samoa fully supports the ongoing\nefforts to strengthen and revitalize our Organization to\nbetter position it for the challenges of the new era. We need\nto say, though, that it does not accord with any real sense\nof commitment to look to the Secretary-General for\nperformance, while denying him and the Organization the\nmeans to do so. We, like so many other Governments,\nmust repeat the call for all arrears to be made good, and\nfor all contributions to be paid in full, on time and\nwithout qualification.\nWe are especially concerned about the failure, thus\nfar, in reform measures for the Security Council and\nmeasures to deal with its current composition.\nMembership of the Council must be enlarged in both\ncategories to reflect the realities of the present time and\nto enhance the Council?s effectiveness and legitimacy. We\nthink the situation of Japan and Germany deserves special\nconsideration.\nWe believe very deeply in the sustaining power of\ninternational law in support of the Charter principles. The\nUnited Nations has been a necessary and a cohesive force\nin the elaboration of international law and rules for\ninternational cooperation, which now regulate a\nphenomenal range of human activity. An important and\noften overlooked fact is the comparatively high rate of\nState party adherence to international instruments and the\nacceptance of a wide range of obligations, whether on the\nenvironment, social development, non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons or in so many other areas. The latest\nexample would appear to be the Ottawa anti-personnel\nmines Convention, an unprecedented global achievement,\nwhich my own country has ratified, and which, by action\nof the international community, is soon to come into\nforce. It is essential that all countries, large and small,\ntake part in the creation of these rules for international\nconduct and behaviour. For small States, they constitute,\nultimately, the most effective measure of protection.\nSamoa was able to play a role in the Rome\nnegotiations for the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court, and is a signatory of its Statute. We\nbelieve that the Court will contribute significantly to the\ninternational legal order and security, for it offers, for the\nfirst time, effective responses to serious crimes of\ninternational concern: genocide, crimes against humanity,\nwar crimes and the crime of aggression. The challenge\nnow is to bring the Statute into force and to implement its\nprovisions. We all have a duty to see to this, at the\nearliest moment. As the Secretary General has said, it is\nan opportunity to take a monumental step in the name of\nhuman rights and the rule of law. Let me note here our\nwelcome for the recent and very important findings and\ndecision of the International Tribunal for Rwanda in\n9\n\n\nrespect of the offences of genocide and crimes against\nhumanity.\nOur Pacific region is one of peace, and we treasure\nour peace. But our security and environment have been put\nunder threat by explosions and the testing of far too many\nnuclear weapons. We will continue with our quest for a\ntotal ban through the development and the implementation\nof the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, the second\noldest of the international regional arrangements, and we\ncall for the active participation and support of all nuclear-\nweapon States for the Treaty and its protocols. In like\nmanner, we will give solid backing to all international\nefforts towards the final elimination of these weapons, in\nparticular, the resolutions of this House on the landmark\nAdvisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice\nconcerning the obligation to pursue in good faith and to\nbring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear\ndisarmament in all its aspects.\nSamoa condemns all testing of nuclear weapons, as we\ndid the underground testing in the South Asia region earlier\nin the year. However, we have heard in this Hall\nencouraging statements by India and Pakistan, and we join\nothers in urging that they commit to a lasting moratorium\nby becoming parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) and that they adhere to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nLet me say also that we applaud Brazil?s accession to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nWe welcome these positive developments most warmly.\nThe United Nations remains a significant part of the\nmodern development and progress of my country. It is with\ncomplete faith that we renew our commitment to the\nCharter. We do so as a small country and with abiding trust\nin the principles of the Charter and the most supportive\nconcern for the welfare of the Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like to congratulate our colleague,\nthe Uruguayan Minister Didier Opertti, on his election to\nthe presidency of our General Assembly.\nI would also like to associate myself with the\nstatement made by our colleague, Mr. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00bcssel,\nwho spoke on behalf of the European Union. My country\nshares and supports entirely the concerns and objectives\nhe outlined.\nUnprecedented crises over the last few months have\nshaken our economies and the economies of the entire\nregion. To varying degrees, the economies of the world\nhave all sustained the social and political consequences of\ninterdependence and the information systems that link\nthem. It therefore seems to me that the time has come to\nrethink seriously the way in which international\ninstitutions and national Governments deal with the\ntensions and constraints which result from globalization.\nThis means specifically that we must reflect upon\nthe quality of life humankind will have in the next\ncentury. Despite worrisome forecasts, we seem unable to\ncome up with a list of priorities which reflects the global\npublic interest. We must establish a common frame of\nreference that ensures the peaceful coexistence of States\nand their citizens while at the same time respecting their\ndiversity. This task is the indispensable corollary of\nglobalization, which has numerous ramifications for\ncurrent problems. The international community\u00e2s\nresponses have therefore been flawed and partial and\nsubject to corporate logic and a narrow view of the\nissues.\nThe limitations of these responses are well known to\nus. Countless children died last year from diseases which\ncould have been eradicated. Tropical forests covering an\narea equivalent to three times the size of Belgium\n21\n\n\ndisappeared. The developing world\u00e2s debt remains\nuntenably large, while expenditures for weapons continues\nto grow. Incalculable numbers of people have been\ndetained, tortured, killed or forced to flee their countries.\nHundreds of innocent victims have lost their lives in\nterrorist attacks.\nGlobal information networks and new technologies\nreduce distances. Thanks to television, more than one\nbillion people can today discover both man\u00e2s incredible\ninventions and the worst abuses he is capable of. This is a\nscenario which touches our conscience.\nToday\u00e2s crises affect the entire global system and call\nfor solutions on the same level. The only way to respond\neffectively is to give a greater role to international solidarity\nand social justice. Those are the two pillars of the new\ninternational ethic that I would like to call for today. This\nis not a simple task. No Government likes to limit its room\nto manoeuvre, even for just causes, if it is the only one\npaying the price for its commitments.\nI am nevertheless convinced that the United Nations\nis the best forum to have a debate on this matter of\ninternational public interest. It is here, and nowhere else,\nthat we can draw up universally accepted norms that have\nthe approval of the largest possible number of States. The\nOrganization can help us strengthen international consensus\nand the acceptance of codes of conduct designed to set the\nboundaries of human dignity and peaceful coexistence.\nEconomic and financial power dominates the world,\nbut the last few months have shown that it is not capable of\nrunning it. The globalization of political life and civil\nsociety leads us to attempt to reach beyond national\nlimitations to confront our problems. Liberalization has\ngenerated significant growth in trade and investments. It has\nalso led to increased transparency between our different\nsocial systems. This transparency obliges us more than in\nthe past to reflect upon our concepts of the rights of the\nindividual and the need to defend them.\nHowever, access to the global economic village has\nnot led to a concomitant strengthening of solidarity. The\ncapacity of men and women to adapt has been severely put\nto the test. The grip of the logic of the marketplace on the\nindividual seems to relegate him to a secondary role in the\ninternational system. Our societies should henceforth\nreconcile the often very divergent effects that globalization\nhas on the individual and on the State \u00e2\u20ac\u201d namely,\nunemployment, competition and financial speculation. The\nbalance between the freedom of some and the rights of\nothers is all too often disturbed. Marginalization and\nabject poverty are reappearing, thereby threatening the\nexercise of the most fundamental of rights. After the\n1980s \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a lost decade, from the point of view of\ndevelopment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the decade of structural adjustments has\nbeen unable to put economies back on the road to\nsustainable development. Differences in income, both at\nthe level of society and at the global level, have been\naccentuated. What can we do? What must we do?\nThe Internet and the financial markets by themselves\ncannot hold the international community together. We\nknow that Governments alone are incapable of dealing\nwith the problems with which they are confronted. This\nis why new forms of solidarity and new ways of dealing\nwith these issues are indispensable. Only a strong political\ninternational organization can counterbalance the forces of\nthe financial markets. The loss of power of nation-States\nover financial and economic decisions is glaring; the\nsocial consequences are even more so. This does not call\ninto question the existing consensus on the validity of\ncontrolled liberalization of trade, but it does put all\nGovernments up against the wall. Has the time not come\nfor some sort of regulation that benefits everyone?\nIndeed, liberalization cannot be an end in itself. It\nhas no purpose if it does not contribute to social progress\nfor the largest possible number of people. We should\ntherefore strive together to find concerted responses to the\nuncontrolled and painful effects of this evolution by\nstrengthening public control throughout the world. In this\nregard some have proposed an economic security council.\nThis is obviously an ambitious idea, but it does serve to\nshow how serious the threat of financial instability and\neconomic uncertainty is to our societies. In any case, an\nintensified dialogue between the United Nations and the\nBretton Woods institutions must be instituted as a first\nstep.\nOf course, regional strategies have been developed\nto strengthen economic convergence in certain regions\nand to integrate them into zones. Nevertheless, these\nregional strategies should respect the rules of\nmultilateralism. Efficient partnerships based on mutual\ntrade have to be developed with other regions without\nmarginalizing third States. Developing countries must be\nintegrated in commerce and enjoy the fruits of market\nliberalization. In this respect, my country supports the\nefforts placed on record by the European Union in the\nspirit referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair trade\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n22\n\n\nI would now like to say a few words about the United\nNations, which is at the centre of all these interactions. I\nsay to you, the representatives of the 185 nations committed\nto the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations, that\nwe have all too often forgotten our obligations under the\nCharter. Now that we are free of the shackles of the cold\nwar and its ideological deadlocks, the obligation to\nstrengthen cohesion between States and to promote social\njustice is more than ever the real order of business.\nIn this respect, I support the proposal to devote the\nMillennium Assembly to the issue of the fight against\npoverty. The gaze of much of the world will be turned\ntowards the United Nations at that time. It would be a\nterrible failure if on that occasion we were only able to\nrefer poverty to various committees, soothing our\nconscience with meetings of fleeting significance. As the\nSecretary-General stresses in his report, the fight against\npoverty starts with good governance. Political\ndemocratization and mechanisms for revenue sharing are\nindispensable elements.\nThe question of Central Africa is currently of\nparticular importance for Africa. After hopes were raised\nfor what some wanted to call an African renaissance, the\ncontinent has again become prey to violence that is\nbecoming dangerously ethnic in character. Once again, the\nprincipal victims are among the most vulnerable people in\nthe world.\nThe crisis in the Great Lakes region is a moral\nchallenge for the United Nations. It imposes on us the duty\nof solidarity. We must help Africa to find solutions and to\nimplement them without interfering or trying to impose\nsolutions. The United Nations, together with the relevant\nregional and subregional organizations, should involve itself\nin an initiative to restore dialogue to the region and to put\nconfidence-building measures in place. I believe that a\nconference on regional security and cooperation in the\nGreat Lakes region \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if it is viewed as a process rather\nthan as a single event \u00e2\u20ac\u201d could serve as the vehicle for\nstabilizing the region. My country is willing to support such\nan initiative.\nPolitical instability, uninterrupted violence and\nchallenges to the nation State have led to large-scale\npopulation movements. In Central Africa, Kosovo and\nelsewhere, hundreds of thousands of families have been\nforced to flee their homes and their land. It is our shared\nduty to continue to assist humanitarian organizations in\ntheir efforts to come to the aid of these refugees and to\nenable them to return home. However, sometimes, when the\nroads or the family land are littered with landmines and\nchildren cannot go to school without being exposed to\nphysical danger, returning can be a problem. We must rid\nourselves of these landmines; their production must stop.\nThese devices of death must be for ever banished from\nthe Earth.\nI welcome the entry into force of the Convention on\nthe total prohibition of anti-personnel landmines and\nappeal to donor and victim countries to support the\nintegrated activities undertaken by the United Nations in\nthis field, including through voluntary financial\ncontributions.\nBut that is not enough. Conflict prevention should be\na priority, and within our Organization we must also pay\nattention to the less spectacular aspects of conflict\nprevention, such as early warning and the establishment\nof an appropriate United Nations presence on the ground.\nConflict prevention will make no sense if we do not\nat the same time put an end to the acquisition of arms by\nthose who attempt to resolve their problems through\nviolence. Belgium has responded positively to the\nEuropean Union initiative to formulate a code of conduct\nfor arms transactions. My country is also a strong\nadvocate of giving the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms effective universal application. It is\nalso behind several initiatives designed to block the illegal\ntransfer of small arms. The Brussels conference, which\nwill take place in October, and our participation on the\nPanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms, provide\nfurther examples of our commitment, which extends to all\nsectors of disarmament. How could it be otherwise, when\nsome countries consider it useful to put on an alarming\nshow of their nuclear expertise?\nA significant contribution to ethical renewal in\ninternational relations was the adoption, after much work,\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It is\nindeed shocking that those responsible for the most\nreprehensible crimes, in particular genocide, can go\nunpunished. Belgium has recently signed the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court and intends to work for\nits effective establishment. My country will also continue\nto support the two existing United Nations ad hoc\ncriminal tribunals. Some countries still harbour doubts\nabout that important undertaking. However, a balance has\nbeen found between international security and justice. The\nonly remaining question is whether we, so-called civilized\nnations, are prepared to adopt binding rules so as to\nensure respect for the most elementary and universally\n23\n\n\naccepted principles of respect for the human being and\ninternational coexistence. Adopting voluntary restrictions to\nstrengthen an international ethical code can only benefit\nStates and their citizens. That is truly the role of the State:\nto ensure that its citizens are protected \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if necessary,\nthrough international law.\nI do not consider it realistic to develop a global ethical\ncode without working for the protection and education of\nour children. Working together with other countries, the\nUnited Nations Children\u00e2s Fund (UNICEF) and other\nUnited Nations organizations, Belgium has played an\nimportant role in a number of initiatives. I propose that the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session build upon its\nachievements with respect to the definition of standards for\nthe protection of children. Child labour is a waste of human\nbeings \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for the girls and boys who are subjected to it and\nfor future generations. Market forces must yield in this\narea. Like the enlistment of child soldiers, child labour is a\nmoral scandal that must be remedied through the\ndevelopment of alternatives adapted to the sociocultural\ncontext at the local level.\nOne of my Government\u00e2s priorities is the fight against\nthe most repugnant forms of exploitation. We are alarmed\nby the use of the Internet by those who traffic in children\nand by networks of prostitutes and all the new forms of\ncrime that make a mockery of traditional methods of\ndefending the rule of law. Here, too, international\ncooperation is the only solution.\nI am also ready to take the initiative, on the occasion\nof the tenth anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of\nthe Child in 1999, to organize, together with UNICEF and\nall interested countries, a meeting in Belgium at which we\ncan all share our experiences with regard to our respective\nlegislation.\nThe ideas that I have outlined will be not bear fruit if\nMember States do not cooperate fully with the\nOrganization. Denying the Secretary-General the resources\nneeded to turn the United Nations into an efficient\ninstrument will only make matters worse. The Secretary-\nGeneral deserves our full support in his reform efforts.\nThe Security Council is crucial for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Its reform is of concern to\nus all. I hope that in the not-too-distant future, a balanced\nenlargement of the Council can be agreed upon. The work\nundertaken during the past year has sometimes been\ndisappointing because of the stubborn resistance of several\ncountries. Belgium belongs to the majority of Member\nStates arguing for a strengthening of the authority of the\nCouncil. My country clearly laid out its position: we\nwould like an equal increase in the number of permanent\nand non-permanent members, better representation of the\nvarious regions and self-imposed limits on the use of the\nright of veto under certain conditions provided for in\nadvance. The privilege of veto is excessive when it is\nused to the detriment of the interests of the international\ncommunity as whole.\nThe consensus proposal put forward by the group of\n10 has numerous advantages and offers material for\nfurther reflection. It is quite disturbing to see that a\nminority of Member States are ignoring the evolution of\ninternational relations over the last 50 years while at the\nsame time claiming for themselves a preponderant role in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nPostponing reform of the Security Council is tantamount\nto an assault on its credibility.\nThe financial health of the Organization has not\nimproved much over the course of the last year. Belgium\nbelieves that countries that accumulate arrears harm the\nentire international community. The damage goes beyond\nthe resulting debt, because the Organization is denied the\nmeans fully to discharge its mandate. Furthermore, the\nreform process is jeopardized. Nothing can make up for\nthe damage this does to international cooperation and\nsocial progress. The political and moral responsibility of\nthose Governments is at stake. None who speak from this\nrostrum can claim their attachment to United Nations\nideals without accepting the financial obligations involved\nin being a Member, that is, payment in full, on time and\nwithout conditions of their financial contributions.\nIn face of the excesses of the international system,\nthe international community must be on guard. Here as\nwell our Organization can be the world\u00e2s conscience. Its\nweighty role is to help Member States formulate adequate\nresponses to the globalization with which we are\nconfronted. It is therefore in a serious yet hopeful frame\nof mind that I look at the agenda of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly and pledge my country\u00e2s full support\nfor the work ahead of us.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept our sincere\ncongratulations, Sir, on the occasion of your election to\npreside over the fifty-third session, as well as our wishes\nfor success in realizing the goals and principles of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe welcome all the efforts of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the benefit of the Organization and\nits Member States, and sincerely wish him further success\non his way, which is strewn not with roses alone.\nWith appropriate respect and great appreciation for\nthe activities of the President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine, we wish him important achievements in his\nactivities as a Member of Parliament in his native\ncountry.\nToday, on the very threshold of the third\nmillennium, it becomes clear for the majority of Member\nStates that the time has come to take comprehensive\nmeasures for everyone to turn the determination of the\npeoples of the United Nations, declared in its Charter,\ninto reality \u201cto save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war ... to practice tolerance and live together\nin peace with one another as good neighbours\u201d. In fact,\nthat was the ultimate goal behind all the diverse activities\nof the United Nations in the years after its Charter came\ninto force in 1945.\nThe world goes through non-stop change. Today the\nglobal environment in which Member States cooperate to\nachieve the goals of the Charter is different from that of\nhalf a century ago. United Nations activities should reflect\nmore adequately those sweeping changes of the second\nhalf of the twentieth century, many of which shattered the\nworld.\nThe Government of the Republic of Belarus has\nbeen persistent and consistent in its efforts to promote\npeace, friendship, good-neighbourly relations and\nmutually beneficial cooperation. This policy is enshrined\nin the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus, chapter 18\nof which, in particular, declares:\n\u201cIn its foreign policy the Republic of Belarus\nproceeds from the principles of the equality of\nStates, non-use of force or the threat to use force,\ninviolability of frontiers, peaceful settlement of\ndisputes, non-interference in internal affairs of States\nand other universally acknowledged principles and\nstandards of international law.\n\u201cThe Republic of Belarus pledges itself to\nmake its territory a neutral, nuclear-weapon-free\nState.\u201d\n30\n\n\nThus the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus is\nconsistent with all our obligations under the United Nations\nCharter and other instruments of international law to which\nBelarus is a party.\nThe United Nations is to define far-reaching goals and\nguidelines for international cooperation into the twenty-first\ncentury. Everybody wants to be better off, to have the\nopportunity to work and live in peace and freedom. There\nis a need for the United Nations to elaborate an effective\nlegislative, economic, social and political framework to give\nhumankind an opportunity to realize these legitimate\naspirations in an environment much more favourable than\nthe one we have had in the century that draws to its close.\nMost global problems are persistent, hard to resolve\nand resist old approaches. We should seek new solutions\nand reach agreements to do away with the problems in\nunconventional, innovative ways. I believe that the\nproposed reform of the United Nations will give us a good\nopportunity to achieve this. Our attitude to the reform was\ndefined in the letter of the President of the Republic of\nBelarus, His Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, to the\nSecretary-General. We must ensure that reforming the\nactivities of the United Nations does not disrupt the\nattainment of its goals and the implementation of its\nprinciples or derogate the interests of Member States and\nregional groups. Reforms should not mean disorganization.\nReforms should mean the synergy of the best United\nNations achievements in all areas of its activities, which\nhave been developed for more than half a century. We\nbelieve in the ability of the Secretary-General and his staff\nto lead our Organization exactly in the required direction.\nOn its part, the Republic of Belarus will do its utmost\nto contribute in all ways possible to the enhancement of the\nefficiency of the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies, and will seek generally acceptable agreements on\nall the issues of the global agenda. Strengthening the United\nNations system and reforming the Security Council on the\nbasis of just and balanced representation of the regional\ngroups would be most instrumental in this respect. Together\nwith other East European States, in particular members of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Belarus\nhas been an active initial proponent of the demand to\nallocate an additional non-permanent seat to that group\nin the expanded Security Council.\nPeople all over the world and the international\ncommunity as a whole can no longer tolerate the killing of\nhuman beings in inter-State and intra-State armed conflicts.\nDuring the years after the Second World War thousands\nupon thousands, if not millions of people, have been\nkilled. Nevertheless, hostilities continue in different\nregions of the globe. Conflicts in Africa, the Middle East\nand the Balkans stay unresolved; still unsettled are\nsituations in Cyprus and other regions. In these\ntremendously difficult circumstances the United Nations\nis continuing to fulfil its responsibility with dignity. Yet\nthere is ample room for further improvement.\nWe consider that the principles of the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes and non-interference in internal\naffairs should be strictly observed while bringing about\nreconciliation in regional and domestic conflicts. Any\nenforcement measures should only be applied following\nthe adoption of a Security Council resolution.\nAccordingly, the use of force by individual States or\nregional organizations at their own discretion should not\nbe permissible. One of the objectives stipulated in the\nUnited Nations Charter, in the preamble, is \u201cto ensure, by\nthe acceptance of principles and the institution of\nmethods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the\ncommon interest\u201d.\nIt is difficult for the Government and people of the\nRepublic of Belarus to comprehend why in certain\nquarters the idea of a military attack on the sovereign\nState of Yugoslavia is being publicly discussed just\nbecause the latter decided to solve its domestic problems,\nthough really complicated, in its own way and would not\nrubber-stamp recipes enforced from outside. It is also\ntime that Yugoslavia?s full membership of the United\nNations be resumed. The mere threat of the use of force\ncould seriously disrupt peace and stability in Europe,\nrevive old fears and animosities and generate more\ndistrust.\nThe very serious problems that humanity faces today\ncan be solved by reason and joint actions, rather than by\nforce. Paradoxically, despite the ever growing industrial\nand economic output in the world, the number of people\nliving below the poverty line is not diminishing. More\nand more people are becoming refugees or displaced\npersons. Humanism, justice, fairness and respect for\nhuman rights have not become universal. Terrorism,\norganized crime and illegal drug trafficking have not been\novercome, and even tend to grow. We share the\nSecretary-General?s view that the forces of globalization\n\u201cpose extraordinary opportunities, as well as enormous\nchallenges\u201d. (A/53/1, para. 229) The recent financial\ncrisis in many parts of the world is one of the latest and\nclearest manifestations of that.\n31\n\n\nEcological interdependence has not yet become a\nmatter of common awareness, as evidenced, in particular,\nby the attitude to efforts to mitigate the after-effects of the\nChernobyl disaster. Belarus, which absorbed 70 per cent of\nall the radioactive Chernobyl fallout, spends one fifth of its\nbudget annually to eliminate the consequences of the\nChernobyl catastrophe. We are grateful for all international\nassistance, particularly in the rehabilitation of children. At\nthe same time, the United Nations has prepared the inter-\nagency programme of international assistance to areas\naffected by the Chernobyl disaster, in order to revive\ninternational interaction for Chernobyl programmes and\nmake it more purposeful and effective. Furthermore, the\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs has organized two international special donor\nmeetings to raise funds for the implementation of this\nprogramme, estimated at $74 million. Yet the results of\nthose meetings appear modest so far and demonstrate a\ndisappointing deficit of international solidarity with the\naffected countries in solving their problems.\nGiven the global dimensions and implications of the\ndisaster, I would like to take this opportunity to again call\non the donor countries, international organizations and non-\ngovernmental organizations to consider every possibility of\ntheir participation in financing the implementation of the\nprogramme.\nIt is common knowledge that Belarus took an\nunprecedented step in post-world-war history by voluntarily\nand unconditionally renouncing the nuclear arsenal in its\npossession. Ukraine and Kazakhstan undertook similar\nmeasures, but at a later stage. These initiatives received\nunanimous high international appreciation, as confirmed by\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, and were also endorsed\nby North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member\nStates, which explicitly welcomed the step. The latter\nspecifically voiced, through NATO?s Secretary-General, its\nsupport of the goal shared by Belarus to \u201cestablish a\ncommon security system that would meet the interests of all\nStates\u201d. At first, it seemed that there was a will to legally\nconsolidate a newly emerging international security system\nand to promote disarmament, non-proliferation and the non-\nuse of nuclear weapons. Those aspirations, however, have\nyet to be realized.\nAccording to the United Nations Disarmament\nCommission, nuclear-weapon-free zones at present cover\nmore than half of the Earth?s surface, with an aggregate\nmembership of 144 countries. Yet there is still resistance to\nthe creation of new nuclear-weapon-free zones, in the\nsouthern hemisphere as well as the northern hemisphere.\nTherefore, the Belarus initiative of retaining a nuclear-\nweapon-free status quo in Central and Eastern Europe is\nalso stalled. The emergence of new nuclear-capable\ncountries also affected the situation with regard to the\nexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones, whose members have\nyet to win the acknowledgement of their nuclear-weapon-\nfree status by the nuclear States. Moreover, there are no\nguarantees that other \u201cthreshold\u201d States will not express\nin the future their intention to join the \u201cnuclear club\u201d. We\nurge those Member States which have not yet done so to\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). We would also welcome progress in the\nrespective activities of the Conference on Disarmament\nand the United Nations Disarmament Commission.\nIn view of the above, a more constructive approach\nto the issue of disarmament and arms limitation, inter\nalia, in the nuclear field, is called for. The reduction of\nnuclear stockpiles currently under way in the United\nStates and Russia is to be complemented by similar\nefforts by other holders of nuclear weapons, so as to\njointly facilitate the complete disbanding of nuclear and\nother means of mass destruction. It is the ultimate\nobjective. To attain it, a number of specific prerequisites\nmust be created.\nI would like to refer in particular to the statement of\nthe NATO ministerial meeting on 10 December 1996,\nconfirmed by the NATO heads of State or Government in\nthe Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and\nSecurity between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nand the Russian Federation of 27 May 1997, which\nmaintains that \u201cthe NATO States have no intention, plan\nor reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of\nthe new members.\u201d We believe that that statement by\nNATO deserves approval by a General Assembly\nresolution.\nI should also mention the 1996 Stockholm\nDeclaration of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly,\nwhich contains a reference to the decision of the 1995\nNPT Review and Extension Conference that \u201cthe\nestablishment of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones by\nthe time of the Review Conference in the year 2000\nwould be welcome.\u201d (NPT/Conf.1995/32, Part I, Decision\n2, para. 6)\nWith due regard to that, we cannot accept the\nargument that it is premature to discuss and implement\nthe initiative to create a nuclear-weapon-free space in\n32\n\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe at this juncture, and that it\nmight only be addressed in the distant future. Inspired by\nnew partnerships, we cannot possibly let the existing de\nfacto nuclear-weapon-free status of Central and Eastern\nEurope evaporate. We are convinced that the establishment\nof a nuclear-weapon-free space in Europe would\nconstructively contribute to the shaping of a new European\nsecurity architecture aspired to by all the OSCE Member\nStates.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights is widely celebrated this year throughout\nthe world. The provisions of the Declaration and other\ninternational instruments on human rights, to which Belarus\nis a dutiful party, are reflected in the Constitution and other\nlegislation of my country and are strictly implemented at\nthe State level, proceeding from the indivisibility and\ninterdependency of civil rights and obligations.\nMuch has been done in Belarus to highlight the United\nNations efforts to promote and protect human rights. The\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights was reprinted and\nwidely circulated. The National Assembly held\nparliamentary hearings devoted to human rights. It should\nbe noted here that the hearings were broadcast live on\nBelorussian radio in their entirety. Other undertakings are\nenvisaged, including preparations to introduce the institution\nof Ombudsman in Belarus. All these efforts are aimed, to\ncite the United Nations Charter, at promoting \u201csocial\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d. The\nrepresentatives of Belarus will give a detailed account of\nthese matters during the discussion of relevant issues on the\nagenda.\nAt the same time, we share the position of other\nMember States that there is an ever pressing need to\nobserve the United Nations Charter and declarations based\nthereon concerning non-interference in the internal affairs\nof States and the protection of their independence and\nsovereignty. The same is true of the principles of\ninternational law referring to friendly relations and\ncooperation between States.\nI would like to pay special tribute to the positive\nexperience Belarus has gained in cooperating with United\nNations bodies. We greatly appreciate the role and\nimportance of the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) in our country regarding human resources\ndevelopment, strengthening the potential of State\nmanagement, restructuring industries and creating civil\nsociety.\nWe hope for a broadening of the United Nations\nprogramme activities related to solving the problems\nfaced by the Republic of Belarus and other countries with\neconomies in transition.\nOur people live in a non-violent environment and\nwork very hard to overcome current economic difficulties\nand achieve substantial output in the State-owned and\nprivate sectors. In that context, in 1997 gross domestic\nproduct increased by 10 per cent and industrial output by\n17 per cent, and the production of consumer goods also\nrose. This all came about as a result of the efforts made\nby the Belorussian people, as well as through the\npromotion of subregional integration and cooperation with\nother countries.\nBelarus, like other CIS States, is painstakingly\nstriving to overcome the tremendous difficulties that\nemerged in the country after the breakup of the Soviet\nUnion. Now that we are in a period of transition, my\ncountry would be justified in expecting encouragement,\nsolidarity and support from the international community.\nWe would appreciate such support from all countries and\nfrom every people of the world.\nThe Republic of Belarus is committed to the\nconscientious fulfilment of all its international obligations\nunder the United Nations Charter in their integrity, and\nwe wish success to the family of nations in this work.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "In just 15 months, our world will\nenter a new millennium, leaving behind it a chequered\npast to face the challenges of a yet uncharted future. It is\nnot too early to contemplate this historic conjuncture and\nto give some thought to how best we may deal with the\nuncertainties ahead.\nThis fifty-third session of the General Assembly\noffers, we believe, a timely opportunity for such\nreflection. Your leadership, Mr. President, will be\nessential to the success of our exploration. We are assured\nthat your diplomatic experience and skills, demonstrated\nin the service of your native Uruguay, will contribute\ngreatly to the success of our deliberations.\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of the\nUkraine, we offer our sincere appreciation and thanks for\nthe admirable guidance which he provided the Assembly\nover the past year.\nOur gratitude is extended to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the inspired direction which he has\ngiven to our Organization. From the report that he has\nbeen good enough to present us on the activities of the\nlast 12 months, we are able to see clearly those areas\nwhere our stated goals have been reached and, equally\nimportantly, those which require our further attention and\neffort.\nCertainly, among the developments that are most\nheartening is the spread of democracy within recent times.\nIt is a happy coincidence that this year we celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights,\nwhich embodies the principles of democracy. The\ndemocratic system has emerged as a popular form of\ngovernment for many States Members of the United\nNations. Guyana has rejoined this growing majority.\nUnfortunately, this had to come after hard struggles and\nour people experienced three decades of lost opportunities\nunder an undemocratic regime. Only last December, for\nthe second time this decade, elections were held under\ninternational scrutiny, leading to the re-election of my\n4\n\n\nGovernment to office. However, despite the fact that the\noutcome was adjudged by international observers to be free\nand fair, the minority opposition refuses to abide by the\nresult. Consequently, the will of the electorate has been\nquestioned. Unfortunately, this negation of elections\nconducted in a free and fair manner is not limited to\nGuyana and increasingly requires our attention. Naturally,\nmy Government cannot tolerate this state of affairs, nor\nshould the United Nations, which by its Charter is called\nupon to protect the gains of new and restored democracies.\nIt is vital that the international community and the\nUnited Nations rally in support of our efforts to achieve\nbetter governance and to guarantee the enjoyment of all\nhuman rights by our citizens. We need to go beyond the\nholding of periodic elections to ensuring the observance of\nthe rule of law and building the institutions upon which\ndemocracy must rest.\nRegrettably, many of our democracies are severely\nlimited, in terms of their own resources, in their ability to\nsatisfy these pressing needs. As a result, hard-won gains are\nunder constant threat of erosion. We firmly believe that it\nis in the interest of the international community as a whole\nto assist in the strengthening of the democratic system as a\nbulwark against encroachment by oppressive regimes. Only\nthrough such cooperation can the democratic ideal take root\nand flourish throughout the world. On our part, we will\nstaunchly defend the gains of our people and we are\nresolved not to allow ourselves to slide once again into the\ndarkness of dictatorship.\nNeedless to say, the spread of democracy within States\nmust be matched by democracy among States. The United\nNations was founded in 1945 on the premise of the\nsovereign equality of all States. This principle is the rock\nupon which international cooperation among peoples has\nbeen built. In their operation, therefore, all organs and\nagencies within the international system must be cognizant\nof the views and wishes of all States. Developing countries\nin particular need to be adequately represented in these\nbodies to ensure that their concerns are addressed.\nIn this scheme of things, we attach great importance\nto reaching general agreement on how the Security Council\nmust be transformed into an organ that enjoys the\nconfidence and support of all States. Clearly, the body\nwhich was created in the aftermath of the Second World\nWar is no longer appropriate to the circumstances of\ntoday\u00e2s world. Sorely needed now is a more representative\nand transparent Council that can adequately address new\nthreats to international peace and security. Accordingly, we\nencourage the Working Group that was created to reform\nthe Council to persist in its search for a suitably reformed\nCouncil.\nOur task is made especially urgent by the realization\nthat, despite our perseverance, the achievement of\ninternational peace and security remains a frustrating will-\no\u00e2-the-wisp. There are today more peacekeeping\noperations than the international community appears able\nor willing to sustain. Some have been reasonably\nsuccessful, and, others appear to promise eventual\nsettlement. Most, however, seem to be ending with little\nto show for the considerable investment of time and\nmoney.\nOne can only conclude from these varying results\nthat increasingly we will have to turn to preventive\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building to fully\naddress and treat the root causes of tension.\nWe are also constantly reminded that,\nnotwithstanding the abatement in East-West tensions, the\ndangers of a nuclear catastrophe are still very real and\npresent. It is impossible to guarantee, in an unstable world\nsuch as ours, that nuclear weapons will not be used, either\nintentionally or inadvertently. Only a complete prohibition\nof such weapons, binding upon all States, can reduce the\nrisk of nuclear disaster. My Government therefore urges\nthe international community to move swiftly to a total\nelimination of these weapons coupled with an undertaking\nto discontinue their production.\nAt the same time, we must redouble our efforts to\ncurb the flow of conventional weapons, which serves to\nfuel conflagrations in trouble spots throughout the world.\nWe must also intensify our search for a collective system\nof security upon which all States can rely for protection.\nPeace, as has been so aptly said, is not the mere\nabsence of war. True peace can only come if it is built on\na foundation of sound economic and social development.\nThe foremost obstacle to peace is poverty, which, when\nit can be borne no longer, explodes with a vengeance. It\nis imperative, therefore, that the problem of poverty be\nsquarely addressed by the United Nations with a view to\nhalving its incidence by the year 2015. Reaching this\ntarget will require concerted action by both developed and\ndeveloping countries. The developed countries have a\nvested interest in the economic prosperity of developing\ncountries, since they represent important markets for their\nexports. A renewal of the dialogue between the industrial\nand the developing nations is urgently needed to achieve\n5\n\n\nthe eradication of poverty. My Government intends to make\nthis a primary goal during this year\u00e2s session of the\nAssembly.\nNotwithstanding the onerous debt obligations and a\nphysical infrastructure which we are tackling as a priority,\nGuyana has come a long way in overcoming poverty and\nmaximizing its full growth potential. Thus, we continue to\nrely heavily on external assistance for our economic\ndevelopment. We are therefore particularly concerned by\nthe rapid diminution of resources made available for\nfinancing by both bilateral donors and multilateral agencies.\nWhile private investment flows have a role to play in the\ndevelopment process, they are still far too selective to be of\nbenefit to weak economies. We need to be assured of the\ncontinued provision of official development assistance,\nsufficient investment flows, technological transfer and trade\nopportunities that would allow for adequate development.\nAs we move into the next century, we have to\nrecognize the reality that developing countries are extremely\nvulnerable to changes in the world economy. The present\ncourse of globalization and liberalization has led to\nmarginalization of the poorer countries. Guyana is a case in\npoint. We have returned to the democratic fold and have\nachieved fairly high growth rates despite structural\nadjustment programmes. But after a few years, we are now\nfaced with a steep drop in prices of our main export\ncommodities, the drying up of developmental aid, adverse\nglobal weather conditions and so forth. At the end of the\nday, our people face tremendous hardships.\nWe are being told that growing investment is needed.\nWe open our economies to work with the private sector for\ndevelopment, and we see investment being directed away\nfrom the poorer countries, making them incapable of\nmodernizing their economies. There is a need for a global\nconsensus to assist developing countries to complete their\ntransition so that they can be equal players in the\nglobalization process.\nThe alternative is to continue to ignore the danger\nsignals which are becoming more and more evident. And,\nas usual, the rich countries will be able to solve their\nproblems, but will do so at the expense of the poorer\ncountries. The gap between the poor and rich will become\ngreater, and conflicts will continue. The narcotics trade,\nmass migration, international crime, poverty and other ills\nwill put severe strains on new and restored democracies.\nAs we have become painfully aware, threats to our\nenvironment also impinge on our peace and security. Global\nwarming and climate changes have increased the\nvulnerability of small States such as Guyana to a wave of\nnatural disasters. The El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o phenomenon recently\ninflicted on our country a period of intense drought,\ntaking a heavy toll on our economy.\nIn our continuing efforts to develop our country and\nmeet the needs of our people, especially those living in\npoverty, my country remains dedicated to the preservation\nof the environment and the sustainable development of\nour resources. We are concerned, therefore, that when we\nseek to exploit our forest and other resources for the\nbenefit of our people, we face criticisms from those who\naccuse us of disregard for the environment.\nThese reproaches are entirely ill-informed, if not\nmischievous. A land of abundant and pristine forests,\nGuyana runs no risk of deforestation. We have in fact put\nin place firm legislative and administrative arrangements\nto ensure the conservation of our natural resources.\nMoreover, under the Iwokrama rain forest project, we\nhave set aside almost a million acres of these forests for\nresearch by the international community into the\npreservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of the\nforests.\nThe four pillars which I have listed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d democracy,\neconomic and social development, human rights and the\nelimination of poverty \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are indispensable to the\nconstruction of peace. Events in the post-war period have\nnot only confirmed this fact, but have also shown that the\nbuilding of peace and development must be the work of\nthe international community. Persuaded of the need for\nenhanced multilateralism, my Government is committed\nto the realization of the late President Cheddi Jagan\u00e2s\nvision of a new global human order. The thrust of his\nproposal sought to reduce the ever widening and\ndangerous gap which exists between countries in the\nNorth and those in the South.\nRecalling the Marshall Plan, which served to rebuild\nEurope from the ashes of the Second World War,\nMr. Jagan argued for a similar enterprise to eradicate\npoverty, promote good governance and bring development\nto all peoples. Only through such enlightened cooperation\ncan the world enjoy the blessings of peace. I wish,\ntherefore, to renew his plea and to call for early\nagreement on the establishment of a more just and\nequitable system of international relations. With the\nnecessary determination and effort, we can make the\ntwenty-first century a golden age for all humanity.\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people of Rwanda and on my own behalf,\nallow me to convey sincere and heartfelt congratulations to\nyou on your outstanding election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. This election\nreflects the unanimous recognition by States of our\nOrganization of your country, Uruguay. A well-deserved\ntribute is likewise extended to your distinguished\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, who demonstrated\ndedication, skill and open-mindedness at the last session.\nHeartfelt fraternal thanks go to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his skill, performance and far-\nsightedness. This fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly is the second in his term of office. The\nGovernment and the people of Rwanda are grateful to the\nSecretary-General for the working visit he made to Rwanda\nin May 1998. That historic visit made it possible for him to\ntake stock of the results of the genocide committed in\nRwanda in 1994, and we thank him for his words of\nencouragement to the Government and the people of\nRwanda for efforts made in the process of rebuilding the\ncountry.\nEach time we have had an opportunity to do so, the\nGovernment of Rwanda has supported the proposals of the\nSecretary-General with regard to the essential reforms of\nour Organization and deemed that the same proposals for\nreform were likewise valid for the reform of the Security\nCouncil. We are prepared to continue our contribution to\nand support for the collective efforts to bring about more\ndemocratization in the Security Council at the dawn of the\nthird millennium.\nThe existence of the specialized agencies within the\nUnited Nations has made this institution an instrument of\ndevelopment, particularly in the economic, social, political\nand cultural fields, and in many other areas. The\nGovernment of Rwanda supports the existence of the\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. The United\nNations reform under way should take them into account in\norder to better structure them to be more operational.\nSince the 1960s, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo has constantly been a source of concern to the\nUnited Nations and the international community. One\nUnited Nations Secretary-General even lost his life there in\nthe search for a solution to the problems of that country.\nToday, more than in the past, this country, Congo \u2014\nwhich has since become the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo \u2014 is experiencing the darkest times in its history,\nbecause genocide is being committed there on the orders\nof the highest authorities of that country.\nSince 2 August 1998, Rwanda, like everyone, has\nbeen witnessing a rebellion in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo against the Government and President Kabila.\nSince then, the Government of Rwanda has consistently\npointed out that that crisis is purely internal and that Mr.\nKabila had definitely been facing a highly structured\nrebellion. The commission of the Ministers for Foreign\nAffairs of the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC), composed of the four member countries\nZimbabwe, Tanzania, Namibia and Zambia, acknowledged\nin its report to SADC, following its fact-finding mission,\nthat a rebellion exists against Mr. Kabila in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. President Kabila\nhimself implicitly recognized the existence of this\nrebellion when he published a long list of Congolese\nauthorities that he banished by withdrawing their\nCongolese passports and issuing international arrest\nwarrants against them. These Congolese were banished by\nPresident Kabila because they are leading the Congolese\nrebellion against him. Mr. Kabila\u2019s implicit recognition of\nthis rebellion was also shown when he arrested and\nimprisoned six journalists from the Kinshasa news agency\n\u201cLa Voix du Peuple\u201d because he suspected them of\nsupporting the Congolese rebellion.\nThe position of Rwanda is to join its mediation\nefforts with those of the international community to find\na solution to the Congolese crisis through negotiations\nbetween the Congolese rebels and the Government of\nPresident Kabila. Unfortunately, these efforts of the\nGovernment of Rwanda have collided with the obstinacy\nof President Kabila, who believes that the solution to this\ninter-Congolese conflict is to persecute and massacre the\nBanyamulenge, the Tutsi and the Rwandese living in\nCongo, as well as Congolese who refuse to support his\ngrim designs.\nIn this respect, Rwanda, like other observers near\nand far, is concerned at the increase in human rights\nviolations committed by the Government of President\nKabila, which is inciting the people to genocide,\nmassacres and racial and ethnic hatred. The Government\nof Rwanda believes that the United Nations must\ncondemn the genocide as well as human rights violations\nbeing committed in the Democratic Republic of the\n4\n\n\nCongo and take the necessary steps against the Government\nof President Kabila.\nThis genocide and these human rights violations are\ncharacterized by summary executions, incitement to hatred\nby President Kabila and members of his Government,\nmassive arrests, arbitrary detentions and forced\ndisappearances. With regard to summary executions and\nincitement to hatred taking place in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, the following facts are illustrative.\nThe present genocide and the massacres in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo are similar to those that occurred in\nRwanda in 1994 when the Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre de Mille\nCollines (RTLM) was inciting people to hunt down Tutsis\nand their Hutu accomplices, as they were called by the\nradio station at the time.\nDuring the Victoria Falls Summit, which took place on\n7 and 8 August 1998, President Kabila declared that those\nwho committed genocide in Rwanda were right and were\nworthy of support then and now. This is tangible evidence\nof recruitment by President Kabila of Interahamwe militias\nand former members of the armed forces of Rwanda who\ncommitted genocide in Rwanda and took refuge in Congo\nBrazzaville, a fact recently denounced by the High\nCommissioner for Refugees.\nAt that same Victoria Falls Summit, President Kabila\nimplied that Rwanda was seeking to establish a Hima\nempire in the Great Lakes region. In that regard, my\nGovernment believes that that statement by President Kabila\nshows his racist leanings and theories, similar to those\nspread during the 1980s by the late President Habyarimana\nand his ilk, who invented this pseudo-empire to stifle the\nclaims of Rwandese refugees who had been in exile for\nmore than 30 years and who were beginning to vociferously\nreclaim their inalienable rights to unconditional return to\ntheir motherland.\nThese, then, are the racist theories cunningly invented\nand orchestrated by the former President of Rwanda,\nMr. Habyarimana, and his regime in order to demonize the\nTutsi. Now, unfortunately, Mr. Kabila is making use of\nthem once more to demonize not only the Tutsi but the\nwhole of Rwanda and all its people. In that context, the\nGovernment of Rwanda requests the international\ncommunity to put an end to these groundless racist theories\nand this campaign to demonize Rwanda and its people.\nPresident Kabila and his close collaborators are\ninciting the Congolese people to acts of mindless violence\nagainst any person suspected of being a rebel, any person\nof Tutsi origin and any person who, according to them, is\nin league, directly or indirectly, with the rebellion.\nThe governmental authorities of Kinshasa are calling\nupon the people, through the official media, \u201cto treat the\nenemy like a virus, a mosquito, a piece of garbage that\nmust be crushed with determination and without mercy\u201d.\nThe Congolese Minister of Justice, who after all is\nsupposed to be safeguarding everyone\u2019s human rights, has\nsaid, \u201cThese Rwandans, these Tutsis, they are insects,\nmicrobes that must be methodically eradicated.\u201d\nIn support of the words of President Kabila, who\nsaid he would export war to Rwanda, the Congolese\nMinister of Health, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji, stated, \u201cThe\nRwandans will become like snakes whose head and tail\nhave been cut off, unable to move, unable to escape.\u201d\nIn response to these incitements to hatred and\nviolence spread by President Kabila and the Congolese\nMinister of Information, Mr. Didier Mumengi, the\nMinister of Health, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji, and the\nDirector of President Kabila\u2019s cabinet, Mr. Yerodia\nAbdoulaye, the population has begun to attack persons\nsuspected of being in league with the rebels. People have\nbeen burnt alive because they were caught with red mud\non their shoes \u2014 red being the colour of the mud in the\nregion of the lower part of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, at that time occupied by rebels.\nThe Government\u2019s soldiers have fired point blank at\nother suspects whose bodies were abandoned in the\nstreets. Several mentally ill people were summarily\nexecuted because of a rumour, spread by Kabila\u2019s\nGovernment, that the rebels had disguised themselves as\nmadmen in order to pass unnoticed. On 27 August 1998,\na mentally ill person living at the corner of Kasai and\nUsoke streets in the town of Barumbu was riddled with\nbullets in the central market of Kinshasa. An unidentified\nperson was summarily shot down because he was caught\nspeaking on a cellular phone. Another person was\nexecuted purely and simply because he was speaking\nEnglish.\nPresident Kabila\u2019s governmental troops are using all\npossible means to wipe out the evidence of the atrocities\nthey commit. Several witnesses, including some\nfishermen, agree that they saw human bodies carried on\nthe waters of the Congo river. Other persons suspected of\nbeing rebels have been buried alive in Kitambo and\nMasina.\n5\n\n\nThe mass arrests, arbitrary detentions and forced\ndisappearances in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nhave been denounced in particular by an African human\nrights association (ASADHO) that works in Kinshasa. The\nassociation denounced these arrests and disappearances on\n10 August and 3 September 1998, and the following facts\nwere stated by this Congolese human rights association:\n\u201cSeveral individuals of Tutsi origin were arrested and\narbitrarily detained in the Kokola and Tshatshi camps\nand in various jails belonging to the information\nservice and in the Kin-Mazi\u00e8re jail in Kinshasa-\nGombe; more than 500 soldiers from the former\nZairian armed forces were arrested, and some are still\nmissing to this day.\n\u201cOther Congolese who are married to Tutsis, friends\nof Tutsis or who look like Tutsis have been arrested\nin connection with this inter-Congolese conflict. Some\npersons have been removed from their homes, their\nhotel rooms and even from the premises of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) in\nKinshasa, as a result of curfews and various manhunt\noperations decreed by the Kabila Government.\u201d\nAll these facts are cited from that Congolese human rights\nassociation.\nThe Rwandan Government believes, once again, that\nthe solution to this inter-Congolese conflict lies in political\nnegotiations between the Kabila Government and the rebels,\nfor the following reasons.\nFirst, the Congolese must resolve among themselves,\nonce and for all, the question of nationality and citizenship,\nthough this is not negotiable. Normally, a question of\nnationality or citizenship is not up for negotiation, but we\nbelieve that this problem has to be resolved among the\nCongolese. Indeed, we wonder why President Kabila\u2019s\nformer ministers, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\nMr. Karaha, and the Minister of State to the Presidency of\nthe Republic, Mr. Bugera, and many other Congolese\ncitizens from the eastern part of the country have been\nbanished from their homes and from Congolese territory. It\nis Rwanda\u2019s view that we cannot eternally have stateless\npeople on our borders, especially the eastern border of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nSecondly, this inter-Congolese conflict has\nrepercussions for the security of the neighbouring countries,\nparticularly Rwanda, given that Kabila\u2019s forces are a\ncombination of all the criminal elements of the countries of\nthe region. Security in the north of Rwanda is constantly\nmenaced by elements of the former Rwandan Armed\nForces and the Interahamwe soldiers who committed the\ngenocide in Rwanda in 1994 and who still use Congolese\nterritory as a rear base in order to reprise their gruesome\ncrimes. The security of neighbouring countries must be a\nconstant source of concern to the Government and the\npeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nmust be constantly mindful of the fact that each time the\nforces of evil seek to sow insecurity in a neighbouring\ncountry, the country of origin of these destabilizing forces\nforfeits its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nThirdly, the Congolese army should be national, not\na Katangese militia composed of followers of President\nKabila; the Congolese of the eastern part of the country,\nthe Banyamulengue, the Congolese of Masisi, those of\nJomba and those of Rutshuru and other eastern locales, as\nwell as other regions of the country, should also be part\nof it.\nFourthly, the inter-Congolese conflict will be\nresolved by good governance and good leadership that\ndoes not incite people to commit genocide and massacre\nof part of the population that it is supposed to protect.\nThe political negotiations between the Kabila Government\nand the rebels must encourage the emergence of this kind\nof leadership, which the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo so urgently needs.\nFifthly, the philosophy of genocide and the culture\nof murder that President Kabila is cultivating in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, with the assistance of\nformer elements of the Rwandan Armed Forces and the\nInterahamwe soldiers that committed the genocide in\nRwanda, as well as terrorists in the pay of either country,\nmust be quickly eradicated from the Congolese population\nby a new, enlightened leadership devoted to the national\ncause, the cause of all Congolese without exception.\nWe have spoken at some length on the problems of\nthe Great Lakes region, and particularly those of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo; this is necessary in\nview of my Government\u2019s great esteem, respect and\nconsideration for the fraternal people of the Congo. That\nis why my Government shouldered its responsibility and\ndid its neighbourly duty to the Congolese people, inter\nalia by demonstrating solidarity with the fraternal people\nof Congo in helping it rid itself of the 32-year\ndictatorship of the former President Mobutu, who had\nbankrupted the country.\n6\n\n\nIn its efforts to find a solution to the present crisis in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government of\nRwanda supports political negotiations leading to the\nemergence of a leadership worthy to guide the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo to a future other than that of\ngenocide \u2014 which, unfortunately, is the situation under the\nregime of President Kabila.\nBut although President Kabila and his cronies have\nbrought disappointment and despair to the Congolese people\nby sowing ethnic hatred in their country, Rwanda \u2014 which\nhad the misfortune to be the victim of the 1994\ngenocide \u2014 has the right to denounce the crime against\nhumanity that is now being perpetrated in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, in order to prevent it from being\nexported to Rwanda, as appears to be on President Kabila\u2019s\npolitical and military agenda.\nWe hope that the United Nations will speedily\ncondemn the genocide being perpetrated in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and will take the necessary steps to\nhalt it before it is too late. Copies of the Dallaire fax on the\ngenocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\nwithout question to be found here in New York, at the\nUnited Nations Office at Geneva, at the European Union\nheadquarters in Brussels and in every Western capital. In\nthe light of the existence of the Dallaire fax, no one can\nclaim not to have been informed in time to condemn\nPresident Kabila\u2019s acts of genocide and those of the\nInterahamwe militia and the elements of the former\nRwandan Armed Forces, who planned and carried out the\ngenocide in Rwanda more than four years ago.\nAt the very beginning of the crisis, the Congolese\nMinister of the Interior, Mr. Ga\u00ebtan Kakudji, quietly\napproached the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and told them that unless\nthey quickly organized the evacuation of all those who had\nbeen arrested, those people would be killed. We wonder\nwhat the United Nations did in response to that alarm\nsounded by a Congolese official, none other than the\nMinister of the Interior, who has now dissociated himself\nfrom President Kabila\u2019s acts of genocide by abandoning his\nministerial post and fleeing his country for Europe,\naccording to information in the media. The defection of the\nCongolese Minister of the Interior, who is a cousin of\nPresident Kabila, may be food for thought, and perhaps for\ninspiration, for President Kabila\u2019s new allies. Will they\ncontinue to support a genocidal regime that has come to be\nabhorred by its own people?\nThe Governor of Shaba-Katanga province also made\na discreet appeal to the United Nations and, thus, to the\ninternational community; he revealed that he had official\norders to massacre all Congolese Tutsis, anyone of\nRwandese origin, and any Congolese who resisted this\ngrim plan. How did the United Nations respond to that\nappeal from the Governor of Shaba-Katanga province?\nMany people are wondering whether or not Rwanda\nhas a presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThey have, indeed, made this an overriding issue. The\nproblem of the situation in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo and of attempts to resolve it is not to find out\nwho is and who is not in the Congo; it is to try to\nunderstand why. Why is a given actor present in the\nCongo? What are the real reasons for such a presence\nthere, and why is another actor not present or even trying\nto be there? Why is genocide being committed in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the orders of the\nhighest authorities, including President Kabila himself?\nWhat is the meaning of the presence in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo of the combined genocidal forces\nthat came from Rwanda in 1994 \u2014 the Interahamwe\nmilitia, elements of the former Rwandan Armed Forces,\nelements of the ex-forces of the former Ugandan dictator\nIdi Amin Dada, terrorists in the pay of one country or\nanother, and other trouble-makers? Around whom and\nagainst whom are these fascist forces uniting in the\nterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo?\nWill the United Nations and the entire international\ncommunity wait for genocide to be committed in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo before they dispatch\na commission of enquiry after the event? Could not the\nInternational Criminal Court \u2014 whose recent\nestablishment through the adoption of a suitable statute\nwe welcome \u2014 quickly take up this matter and arrest the\nleader and his henchmen who are now engaged in murder\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo?\nThose are the real questions that in our humble view\nshould be asked about the present crisis in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo \u2014 a crisis to which a purely\npolitical solution has to be found through political\nnegotiations between the Government of President Kabila\nand the Congolese rebels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to\nextend my most sincere compliments to you, Sir, Foreign\nMinister of Uruguay, on your assumption of office as\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like to express my respects to Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, Deputy of the Supreme Rada of Ukraine, for all\nhis efforts during his tenure as President of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly.\nHow should we build the framework for a new\ninternational order in the twenty-first century? This is the\nquestion that our international community is facing amidst\nnew situations that were created in the aftermath of the\ncollapse of the cold war, almost a decade ago. That\ncollapse provided an opportunity to establish a harmonious\norder based upon the cooperation of the entire international\ncommunity, rather than the maintenance of peace by a\nmilitary balance between two super-Powers. However, our\ninternational community today is troubled with frequent\nregional conflicts and challenged by the inseparably\nconnected problem of poverty. Creating a new system to\ncope effectively with such challenges is the greatest agenda\nfor our international community today. To achieve this\nobjective, we must simultaneously promote three issues:\npeace and development, which are two sides of the same\ncoin, plus United Nations reforms, which are indispensable\nin our efforts to achieve the first two.\nToday, the possibility of a world-wide conflict has\ndecreased in comparison to the cold-war era, but conflicts\narising from such causes as ethnic and religious\nconfrontation are increasing. In dealing with these\nconflicts, it is more important to focus on how to prevent\nthem rather than on how to solve them once they break\nout. In this regard, we must first consider the essential\nissues of arms control and disarmament. The recent\nnuclear tests of India and Pakistan constitute enormous\nchallenges to the non-proliferation regime. We urgently\nneed to find a way to prevent the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and to\nstrengthen the non-proliferation regime. Furthermore, it is\nnecessary to deal not only with the weapons of mass\ndestruction, such as nuclear, biological and chemical\nweapons, but also with such conventional weapons as\nsmall arms and anti-personnel landmines.\nSocial instabilities lie at the root of conflicts. This\nmakes it extremely important to deal with development\nissues. There are also growing global threats, such as\nenvironmental destruction and terrorism. The cruel\ndestructive power of terrorism especially threatens the\nlives and safety of citizens. It is different by nature from\nconventional armed conflict between nations, but in the\npost-cold-war world it poses increasingly grave concerns\nto our security. Our international community should\nseriously consider ways to effectively cope with these\nproblems and threats.\nToday, based on such thinking, I should like to\ndiscuss these issues from the perspectives of peace and\ndevelopment and of reform, which is indispensable in\npromoting the first two. In so doing, I want to elaborate\non our thinking and express our determination to play a\nleading role in fulfilling our responsibilities.\nI should first like to talk about nuclear non-\nproliferation, arms control and disarmament, which are\nessential to maintaining peace. In May this year, India\nand Pakistan conducted, to our deepest regret, a series of\nnuclear tests, which are formidable challenges to the\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. In seeking a world free\nof nuclear weapons, it is indispensable that we allow no\nfurther proliferation and secure a solid basis for the\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. The existing format\ncertainly is not perfect, but there is no feasible, realistic\nalternative if we are to ensure stability in our international\ncommunity. No country should be allowed to attempt to\nset back international efforts towards strengthening the\nnon-proliferation regime. At the same time, to improve\nthe effectiveness of this regime, it is important, together\nwith the efforts by all nations to maintain non-\nproliferation, to see sincere implementation of nuclear\n16\n\n\ndisarmament by nuclear-weapon States. Based on this\nthinking, we regard the following five points as important.\nFirst, the nuclear non-proliferation regime should\nbecome more universal. The Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) sets the structure\nfor international control of nuclear weapons, with no\nalternative, and we strongly urge non-parties to accede to\nthis Treaty promptly and without condition. In this context,\nwe highly appreciate Brazil\u00e2s accession to the NPT in\nAugust this year.\nSecondly, in order to complement the NPT and ensure\nnuclear non-proliferation, I should like to underline the\nneed to place strict export controls on equipment, materials\nand technologies that relate to nuclear weapons and\nmissiles. We urge every nation to engage in serious efforts\nto prevent any transfer of such materials and technologies.\nThirdly, we must prevent any further nuclear testing.\nWithout universal support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the effectiveness of the nuclear\nnon-proliferation system cannot be maintained. I should like\nto call on nations that have not yet done so to promptly\nbecome parties to this Treaty so as to realize its early\neffectuation. In the meantime, we should take necessary\nsteps to assure the cessation of nuclear testing.\nFourthly, further advancement of nuclear disarmament\nby nuclear-weapon States is more important than ever in\nmaintaining and strengthening various efforts for nuclear\nnon-proliferation. We hope to see early effectuation of\nSTART II and an early launching of negotiations on\nSTART III. Also, we welcome such actions as the decision\nby the British Government in July this year for a significant\nreduction of their nuclear arsenals, as well as France\u00e2s\ndecision to dismantle its ground-to-ground missiles. We\nurge all the nuclear-weapon States to implement sincerely\ntheir obligations under article 6 of the NPT, thereby\npromoting nuclear disarmament even further.\nFifthly, to put a cap on nuclear-weapons capability,\neach nation must positively participate in and reach an early\nconclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty.\nDuring this session of the General Assembly, Japan\nwill take initiatives to promote these five objectives.\nNeedless to say, the promotion of arms control and\ndisarmament should not be limited to the area of nuclear\nweapons. Dealing with other weapons of mass destruction,\nsuch as biological and chemical weapons, as well as\ndelivery vehicles, such as missiles, is of high importance.\nThe recent missile launch by North Korea, even if it was\nan attempt to launch a satellite into orbit, poses a serious\nproblem which directly concerns both Japan\u00e2s national\nsecurity and peace and stability in North-East Asia. It also\nconstitutes a challenge to our efforts to prevent the\nproliferation of delivery vehicles of weapons of mass\ndestruction. I renew my call for North Korea to consider\nseriously the 15 September statement by the President of\nthe Security Council as a message reflecting the views of\nthe entire international community, and to never repeat\nsuch an act.\nFurthermore, to prevent the outbreak and escalation\nof conflicts, we also need to address the problems of anti-\npersonnel landmines and small arms, including automatic\nrifles, regarding which we have yet to make sufficient\nefforts. We intend to continue to play a leading role on\nthese issues. In particular, in the area of anti-personnel\nlandmines we will endeavour to strengthen international\ncooperation towards early realization of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero victim\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nobjective, by supporting assistance for victims and the\nelimination of landmines. We are pleased that 40\ncountries have now ratified the Convention banning anti-\npersonnel landmines and that it will enter into force on 1\nMarch next year. We are now making efforts for Japan\u00e2s\nearliest possible ratification of this Convention. We ask\nother nations yet to ratify it to do so promptly, so that it\nmay become a universal framework to ban anti-personnel\nlandmines totally.\nConflicts give rise to intolerable crimes against\nhumanity, such as genocide. To deter such crimes, it is\nnecessary to establish a permanent international court that\npunishes such acts as international crimes. Adoption of\nthe agreement in July this year in Rome to establish such\na court was an act of historic significance. Japan believes\nthat the blessing and cooperation of the entire\ninternational community is indispensable if the court is to\nproduce effective results. That is why we took important\ninitiatives at the Diplomatic Conference. It is our hope\nthat the International Criminal Court will continue to\ngrow and become a universal framework.\nIn our efforts towards peace, with civilian staff\nassuming an increasing role in United Nations activities,\nincluding peacekeeping, we observe with regret an\nincreasing number of cases where non-combatants become\nthe targets of violence by belligerents. In July this year,\na staff member from Japan, together with staff members\nfrom Poland, Tajikistan and Uruguay, fell victim to a\n17\n\n\ndespicable criminal act directed at the United Nations\nMission of Observers in Tajikistan. The countries concerned\nand the United Nations need to seriously examine ways to\nensure the security of United Nations personnel and of\nrelevant humanitarian-assistance organizations. In this\nregard, we reiterate our call upon nations that have not yet\ndone so to join the Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel, adopted in December\n1994, so that it may come into force as soon as possible. At\nthe same time, Japan will also make contributions of about\n$1 million to the United Nations to support security\nmeasures for United Nations personnel. We hope many\nother countries will also make contributions to support\nUnited Nations efforts in this field.\nSome of the basic causes of conflicts are problems of\neconomic and social development. We must pay close\nattention to them. During the Tokyo International\nConference on Preventive Strategy, which Japan hosted this\nJanuary, participants underlined the importance of a\ncomprehensive approach in dealing with such problems by\ncoming to grips with various causes of them, including\npoverty.\nThe development issue is the greatest challenge the\nworld will face in the twenty-first century. In addressing\nthis issue, we have to deal not only with the economic-\ndevelopment problems of the developing countries, but also\nwith the social sides of development, such as human rights\nand good governance.\nJapan has been advocating a new development strategy\nthat contains such ideas. We are pleased that the concept\nwas endorsed in 1996 at the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development and has been gaining support\nin the United Nations. This strategy is based on the\nphilosophy that the international community should make\nno distinction between donor countries and recipient\ncountries and should tackle the problems of development as\na common issue for all. In this regard, this strategy attaches\ngreat importance to developing countries\u00e2 playing an active\nand responsible role in their own development. It also\nemphasizes positive cooperation based on partnership\nwithout distinction between developing and developed\ncountries. These are the guiding principles of the new\ndevelopment strategy.\nOn the basis of these principles, the Second Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD II) will be held in Japan this October as a follow-\nup to the first Conference, held in 1993. Its objective is to\nseek a path to promote the new development strategy in\nAfrica so as to support African countries\u00e2 own nation-\nbuilding efforts. In this regard, we aim to draw up an\nagenda for action.\nJapan also has been making the greatest\ncontributions possible to the stable development of Asia.\nIn the present financial and economic crisis we have\ntaken initiatives to implement measures of support\ntotalling about $43 billion to Asian countries, which is the\nlargest single contribution by any nation in the world.\nSimultaneously, Japan is making every possible effort,\nthrough such measures as stabilizing our financial system,\nto put our own economy on a recovery track within the\nnext year or two. We believe that the early recovery of\nour own economy is the best contribution we can make to\nthe economies of Asia and of the world. We hope\nstrongly that the coming conference, TICAD II, will\nbenefit from such Asian experiences and provide a good\nopportunity to use the wisdom and power of the entire\ninternational community to assist the development of the\nAfrican continent.\nIn the post-cold-war transformation of international\nrelations, Japan is actively promoting what we call\nEurasian diplomacy. This means redefining relations with\ncountries of the Eurasian continent, including the Russian\nFederation, the People\u00e2s Republic of China, the Republic\nof Korea and countries in the Silk Road regions of\nCentral Asia and the Caucasus range. This is another\nexample of Japan\u00e2s policy of promoting peace and\ndevelopment in tandem.\nIn today\u00e2s world, problems that directly threaten\npeople\u00e2s daily lives across national borders are becoming\nincreasingly serious. These include environmental\ndestruction, overpopulation, human rights violations, the\nexodus of refugees, terrorism, drug-trafficking,\ninternational organized crime and global diseases such as\nAIDS. To cope with these problems, our international\ncommunity must be united under the concept of\nprotecting the security and dignity of mankind from\nglobal threats. Furthermore, citizens, along with\nGovernments, must get together to engage in common\nundertakings, such as making common rules. In particular,\nas we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, I should like to\npoint out that efforts against large-scale human rights\nviolations and efforts to ease refugee problems arising\nfrom conflicts are also indispensable for preventing\nconflicts.\n18\n\n\nIn addressing issues of peace and development, there\nis an urgent need to reform the United Nations and to\nstrengthen its functions. Peace and development are two\nsides of the same coin. At the same time, if the United\nNations is to respond effectively to various problems that\nour international community shoulders, we urgently need to\ndo our best to assure a healthy financial basis. This includes\neach Member State\u00e2s sincere implementation of its\nobligation to pay its assessed contribution. Japan\u00e2s\nassessment will be over 20 per cent, exceeding the sum of\nthat of four permanent members of the Security Council,\nnot including the United States. In this situation, reform in\nthe financial area requires serious attention. In reforming\nthe United Nations to strengthen its functioning, we must\npromote reforms in three interrelated areas in a balanced\nmanner: reform in the political area, the development area,\nand the financial area, which supports political and\ndevelopment activities.\nIt is regrettable that even though the chances of\nmaterializing reforms increased during last year\u00e2s General\nAssembly session, discussions on the reform of the Security\nCouncil have not developed since then. Under the\ncircumstances facing the international community I\nmentioned earlier, reforming the Security Council to\nreinforce its legitimacy and effectiveness is an urgent task.\nJapan, with the endorsement of many countries, is prepared\nto assume greater responsibilities as a permanent member\nof the Security Council. This would be in accordance with\nour basic philosophy of non-resort to the use of force\nprohibited by our Constitution. We are now in the fifth year\nsince the concrete discussions on the reform of the Security\nCouncil started. Points of argument have been exhausted.\nWe are now at a stage where each country should make a\npolitical decision. Japan believes that we are able to agree\non a package that responds to the interests of the entire\ninternational community and to the legitimate concerns of\nthe majority of countries. If we do not have the will to\ndecide and act in order to achieve an agreement on such a\npackage, we will not be able to respond effectively to\nchallenges the international community will face in the\ncoming century. Japan strongly urges all countries to make\na bold political decision for the strengthening of the United\nNations so that we may reach an agreement on the\nframework of the reform during the present session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe twenty-first century is just around the corner. It is\nour duty to preserve and develop the heritage of mankind\nin the coming century. The late professor, Mr. Yutaka\nAkino, who gave his life during his mission of\npeacekeeping in Tajikistan, was one of my close friends.\nHe had the following motto: do not be pushed around by\nevents; take action. Along the same lines, the United\nNations should make action a top priority and become a\nstrong Organization equipped with both effectiveness and\ncredibility, squarely tackling all problems. We the\nMember States should make utmost efforts to achieve it,\nso that the United Nations can enter the twenty-first\ncentury as such an Organization. The future of the United\nNations is in the hands of the Member States. My guiding\nprinciple in Japan\u00e2s policy management is to be sincere,\nto be steady and to be courageously prompt. I therefore\nshould like to conclude my remarks by emphasizing my\nresolution to take leadership in addressing issues of peace,\ndevelopment and reform in a sincere, steady and\ncourageously prompt manner.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to offer my sincere\ncongratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nUruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, on his election to the post of\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session\nand to wish him every success in this important task. I am\nconfident that his long experience and abilities will\ncontribute to the successful outcome of the current session\nof the General Assembly. I should also like to express our\nappreciation to the previous President of the General\nAssembly, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his energetic and\nprofessional work.\nI would like to take this opportunity to draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to the problems that are of greatest\nconcern to the States of our region.\nThe international community fully recognizes the\ndanger of recent developments in Afghanistan, South Asia\nand the Republic of Tajikistan. There is an enormous\npotential for conflict in this subregion today. The threat\nthat the Afghan conflict may explode and spread to\nneighbouring States remains a real one. Uzbekistan has\nrepeatedly appealed to the international community from\nthis rostrum for assistance in resolving the Afghan\nproblem.\nThis goal should be served, inter alia, by our\ninitiative to impose an arms embargo on Afghanistan. The\nappeal to halt deliveries of weaponry and mat\u00e9riel to all\nparties to the conflict has been reflected in numerous\nSecurity Council resolutions and awaits the creation of an\neffective mechanism within the United Nations so that it\ncan be implemented. The Six Plus Two group, with the\nparticipation of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbouring countries, as\nwell as the United States and the Russian Federation,\nwhich was established as a result of a proposal by\nUzbekistan, is today, in our opinion, the only effective\ninternational mechanism within the United Nations\ncapable of launching the peace process. Its task is not to\ncondemn the warring factions, to criticize them or to\nsupport one of them against the others. We are united by\na common goal, which is to find a path to stability,\nsecurity and peace.\nA great deal of interest is now focused on energy\nprojects and transport communications in the region.\nHowever, the implementation of these projects should not\ncause confrontation, but should on the contrary promote\nstability and the development of mutually beneficial\ncooperation between the States of the region. Given the\nongoing hostilities in Afghanistan, the importance of the\nSix Plus Two group as a full-fledged negotiating\ninstrument is growing. Within that framework \u2014 and\nwith the cooperation of the inter-Afghan forces \u2014 it is\npossible not merely to elaborate the terms of\nreconciliation but also the necessary measures to restore\nstatehood to that country and bring about its economic\nrevival. In that connection, we fully support the decisions\nof the meeting of the Six Plus Two group held at the\nlevel of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, which took place\non 21 September of this year in New York. We also\ncommend the efforts of the Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General for Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar\nBrahimi.\nRecent developments in Afghanistan have confirmed\nthat one of the most important conditions for the\nrestoration of peace in the Islamic State of Afghanistan is\nthe achievement of consensus at the regional level and the\nelaboration, under the aegis of the United Nations, of a\n17\n\n\nsingle position to be taken by the countries that have an\ninfluence on events in that country. Cooperation with the\nAfghan factions in order to reach a speedy settlement of the\nAfghan conflict is the ultimate goal of the proposed on-site\nmeeting of the Six Plus Two group in Tashkent. We hope\nfor further support for this proposal from interested States\nand the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\nThe problems that affect the vital interests of\nUzbekistan, in particular the establishment of lasting peace\nin Tajikistan, the cessation of war in Afghanistan, the\nimposition of an arms embargo on the Afghan zone of\nconflict, the establishment of a Central Asian nuclear-\nweapon-free zone, the construction of transport\ncommunications and the revival of Aral Sea are all part of\nglobal international processes that are under way and could\nbe implemented under the aegis of the United Nations.\nI believe that the events of the last decade have\nconvinced everyone that no State can, on its own, resolve\ntransnational security problems such as illicit drug-\ntrafficking, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and of their components.\nThe Government of Uzbekistan welcomes the efforts\nof the United Nations to counter the spread of narcotic\ndrugs and to implement the Political Declaration adopted at\nthe twentieth special session of the General Assembly, held\nin New York in June 1998. Today, in some European\ncountries, up to 90 per cent of the narcotic drugs consumed\noriginate in Afghanistan. The international community is\naware of the need to take coordinated action to counter\nillegal trafficking in narcotic substances and to implement\nthe principles of international cooperation in this area on\nthe basis of mutual assistance and solidarity. However, we\nbelieve that these principles should also reflect specific\nregional aspects. In particular, once again we call for the\nelaboration of special programmes to plan for concrete,\njoint action by the States of Central Asia and the European\nUnion.\nUnfortunately, terrorist acts have become a common\noccurrence in many countries. Existing international\nmechanisms to fight terrorism, including political isolation,\neconomic sanctions and direct military intervention, are not\nachieving results. We should have no illusions about this\nphenomenon. Today we need coordinated and targeted\naction by the entire international community. In that\nconnection, we welcome discussion of one of the most\ncomplex issues in international law: the possibility of and\nneed for a new approach to the problem of terrorism. The\nimportance of resolving this whole set of problems is\nobvious.\nIn this connection, Uzbekistan has taken the\ninitiative to establish within the framework of the United\nNations a commission for the prevention of terrorist\nactivities and for fighting international terrorism. The\nmain task of such a commission would be to formulate\nrecommendations on questions relating to the fight against\ninternational terrorism. Making use of legal norms, the\nUnited Nations could prosecute the organizers and\nperpetrators of terrorist acts. If Member States support\nthis initiative, Uzbekistan will take an active part in\nbringing it to fruition.\nUzbekistan has consistently taken steps to ensure\npeace and strengthen regional security. One of these is\nUzbekistan\u2019s initiative to establish a Central Asian\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. Considerable progress has\nalready been made to implement this idea. Allow me to\ncite the closing statement of the President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko:\n\u201cIn a decision designed to further promote the\nregime of nuclear nonproliferation, the Assembly\nadopted a consensus resolution supporting the\ninitiative to establish one more nuclear-weapon-free\nzone, in Central Asia. The significance of that step\nbecame even more apparent in the light of the recent\nnuclear tests in southern Asia\u201d. (A/52/PV.92)\nHere, let me express our special gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the Under-\nSecretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha\nDhanapala, for their well-informed and strong support of\nthis initiative.\nWhen considering potential threats to national\nsecurity, we ought today to give special attention to\nproblems of ecological security and environmental\nprotection. It is common knowledge that the drying up of\nthe Aral Sea has caused many complex ecological, socio-\neconomic and demographic problems, whose origins and\ngravity are international, even global. The Aral crisis is\none of the most serious of the world\u2019s ecological and\nhumanitarian disasters. It has had a direct impact on more\nthan 35 million people who live in the Aral Sea basin.\nA number of decisions have been adopted at\ninternational and regional meetings on the problem of the\nAral Sea. But these have not been backed up by practical\n18\n\n\naction. We are obliged to say that the idea is gaining\nground in the international community that the Aral crisis\ncan be contained through humanitarian operations. That is\nnot the case. This is an extraordinary ecological problem\nthat requires the establishment within the United Nations\nsystem of a regional commission on the ecology of Aral\nSea. This initiative is justified by the need to formulate and\nimplement a specific long-term strategy and programme for\nresolving the Aral crisis on the basis of the principles of\nsustainable development, maintaining the standard of living\nof the people of the region, and ensuring a decent life for\nfuture generations.\nModern Uzbekistan is in the process of establishing a\nState based on the rule of law, a civil society and an\neffective, socially oriented market economy. It has an acute\nneed for the experience and know-how of international\nbodies. At the same time, our republic is devoting great\nattention to the question of recruiting Uzbek experts for the\nactivities of a variety of United Nations bodies. Let me\nstress that the level of training and knowledge of Uzbek\nspecialists is fully in keeping with the requirements for\nrecruitment to the bodies and specialized agencies of the\nUnited Nations system. I am confident that specialists from\nUzbekistan can and should contribute to the work of\ninternational organizations.\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress in particular that\nour relationship with the United Nations is intended not\nonly to obtain assistance and support, but primarily to\nenable us to play our full part in the successful\nimplementation of the purposes and principles of the United\nNations and to give fresh content to the activities of the\nOrganization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my sincere congratulations, Sir, on your\nelection. I am convinced that your solid academic\nbackground and valuable experience as a statesman will\nserve your country, Uruguay, well, and will strengthen\nLatin America?s image.\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General on the\nexcellent report he submitted to the General Assembly at\nthis fifty-third session. It is a document rich in profound\nanalysis and noteworthy proposals for these new times.\nI am speaking on behalf of Venezuela before the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations at a time when my\nGovernment?s term is drawing to a close, in just a few\nmonths. Venezuela?s words are candid and sincere, for we\nare ever at the ready to make our modest but solid\ncontribution to the establishment of stable friendship and an\neffective and durable peace among all the peoples of the\nworld.\nThe century that is drawing to a close has left a deep\nimprint on human history. Two gigantic wars nearly put\nan end to our civilization?s impressive progress and,\nabove all, to the respect for human rights that is\nfundamental to all progress. An unparalleled revolution\nseemed destined to change decisively the face and destiny\nof the world, and the end of that revolution was the most\nstriking and fortunate surprise the world has ever seen.\nThe world war that started in 1914 revealed to the\nhorror-stricken eyes of the world the human capacity for\nevil and destruction. But it was followed by two decades\nof lavishness and squandering that made people forget the\nroot causes of the conflagration. The attempt to create a\nLeague of Nations awakened ideals and showed the way,\nbut it disintegrated when the thunder of cannons\nannounced the outbreak of the Second World War. The\nsubsequent post-war era, enriched by the bitter lessons of\nexperience, encouraged by suffering and inspired by the\nideals of peace and liberty, lived for five decades under\nthe threat of nuclear war. The terrible catastrophe\npredicted as the inevitable result of the so-called cold war\nremained at the forefront of the world?s concerns until the\nmemorable fall of the Berlin Wall, which opened the new\nera in which humanity now finds itself.\nFor half a century peacekeeping has been a difficult\nand sometimes agonizing task. Faith in ideals was not\nenough to resolve the problems; what was needed was the\nwill and firm purpose, illuminated by experience.\nThe United Nations has undoubtedly played a very\nimportant role in this peacekeeping task, despite all the\ndeficiencies and errors it could be accused of. It has been\nthe irreplaceable forum where all countries could talk to\neach other, where all ideologies, all ethnic groups, all\npolitical systems, could meet, without losing sight of the\ngoal of encouraging and fostering freedom everywhere\nand of practising and promoting, by all legal means\npossible, the democratic system, the only system that is\ntruly compatible with respect for human rights and the\nfree competition of all to govern. The Organization has\nmanaged to keep its respected position, and today we\nhope to be able to strengthen it further so as to work\nfirmly together to confront the new problems and\nrealities, something that will require ever greater efforts.\nThe century that is coming to an end has also been\na time of incredible transformations. Air travel, which had\n10\n\n\nbeen the dream of a few visionaries, has become an\neveryday reality, and each hour thousands of people fly in\nand out of airports around the globe. The great adventure\nof space exploration has now left progress in air travel\nbehind, starting with man?s travels to the moon.\nThe very nature of the planet we live on has been the\nobject of comparisons that take us across infinite distances\nin our thoughts about the basic nature of the universe. The\nposition of our solar system and the global unity we live in,\nin relation to the whole cosmos, is a subject we are trying\nmore and more to define and penetrate.\nFurthermore, in just a few short years, compared with\nthe span of history, the communications revolution has\nmade the world more unified, more interdependent, more in\nneed of standards and systems that cannot be imposed by\nthe most powerful, but must be the result of consensus,\nwith respect for each individual?s identity and right to life.\nIn today?s society we are fully conscious of the\ninfinite presence of what is large, but we also have a\nprecise idea of the importance of what is infinitely small.\nThe technological revolution has not left an iota of\nknowledge untouched by its transforming impact. And those\nwho cultivate thought, pure science and art laboriously\nsearch for new avenues, driven by a zeal that arises from\nthe progress already achieved in changing mankind?s way\nof life.\nWe strongly favour the Secretary-General?s plans for\nreform of the Organization. We are convinced that the\nSecurity Council must be enlarged. The establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court represents an important\nstep in the juridical life of the international community. The\nfight against drug trafficking and terrorism increasingly\nrequires that the international community become its centre\nof coordination. These are delicate and demanding problems\nthat cannot be left to the individual actions of States,\nhowever powerful. The international community therefore\nfaces an arduous task.\nThe fight against poverty has been one of the most\nimportant aspects of international action in the last few\nyears. The World Summit for Social Development reflected\none of the priority concerns of the United Nations. The\nongoing activities of specialized agencies and the projects\nof the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nmark out a clear path in the search for a solution to this\nproblem, a path that must be extended over the whole\nsurface of the Earth. We know full well that peace, true\npeace, stable and permanent peace, requires justice, and that\njustice is most truly expressed in social justice. This was\nrecognized by the victorious countries in the Treaty of\nVersailles at the end of the First World War, and it was\nalso expressed in the Declaration of Philadelphia of 1944\nby the belligerents about to triumph in the Second World\nWar. The fight against poverty is ever more necessary\nand urgent, for the market economy and the current\nglobalization process cannot on their own respond to the\ndemands that social problems make on world leaders.\nIn addition to its positive aspects and the progress it\nundeniably entails, the complex phenomenon we have\ncome to call globalization can also have progressively\nnegative effects on the emerging developing countries.\nFaced with the world?s present imbalance, we must\ntherefore make a special point of emphasizing the harmful\neffects of international financial speculation. The balance\nof terror imposed by the cold war has been replaced by\na lack of financial discipline, by ruthless speculation that\nis alien to the values of solidarity and ethics that should\nprevail even in technology?s most sophisticated advances.\nThe poorest countries are the traumatized victims of this\nreality, but the whole world community may be\nthreatened by this situation that will affect even the\nadvanced countries. No one can escape the consequences\nof this situation. I therefore believe that today?s\ninternational agenda must concentrate on this critical\npoint, giving it priority over other objectives that, though\nalso important, must give way to this indispensable\nmatter.\nMy country?s delegation to the United Nations has\nset forth, first to the Group of 77 and then to the General\nAssembly, the need to call a special meeting to study the\nfinancing of developing countries. If financial assistance\nto the developing countries is not addressed on a priority\nbasis, if the necessary resources are not forthcoming from\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as\nwell as other agencies dealing with the basic aims of\ndevelopment, globalization will not be as successful as we\ncould hope it to be.\nThe effects of the Asian crisis on Latin America\nhave resulted in the weakening of some currencies, a\nsignificant downturn in the capital markets, rising internal\ninterest rates, restrictions to the obtention of external\ncredits and a rapid increase in the risk factors for many\nemerging countries.\nThe visible effects of the phenomenon of\nglobalization have demonstrated the imperfections of the\ninternational financial and monetary system, which has\n11\n\n\nrecently been characterized by, inter alia, the sharp impact\nof the participation of powerful financial groups and the\ndecisive actions of certain parties, such as the agencies that\nassess risk, certain of which have become a worse threat\nthan the terrible forces of other times. The time is ripe to\nencourage a better understanding between developed and\ndeveloping countries, all equally affected by financial\ninstability. Venezuela believes that financial and monetary\nissues must have a permanent place on the agenda of the\nUnited Nations system. To that end, the exchange of ideas\nbetween the Organization and the international financial\ninstitutions that make up the Bretton Woods system must be\nencouraged and strengthened.\nFundamentally, globalization will depend on the\nbalance between rich and poor, between the more advanced,\nthe intermediately advanced and the least developed\nnations, and on the application of equitable formulas to\nalleviate the external debt burden referred to by the\nSecretary-General in his report.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, there is no more\nimportant objective than to steer the concern of the\ninternational community in this direction. If measures are\nnot taken to put an end to the abuses of what His Holiness\nJohn Paul II called savage capitalism, which gives rise,\nwith its excessive desire for profit, to unstable situations\nthat are transmitted with vertiginous speed to all the world?s\neconomic centres, we will have replaced the fear of nuclear\nwar with the threat of an economic and social catastrophe.\nIt is my view that in today?s globalized world, one of\nthe primary commitments of the community of nations,\nworking through and coordinated by the United Nations, is\nto strengthen its resolve to prevent and correct unacceptable\nimbalances, and to ensure the awareness and capacity of the\ninternational financial mechanisms for facing contingencies.\nIn a few weeks, the people of Venezuela will go to the\npolls to elect their new leaders. For 40 consecutive years,\nat each constitutionally determined interval, the transfer of\npower stipulated by the Constitution of the Republic has\nbeen carried out. In shifting circumstances, the institution\nof democracy has remained stable in an atmosphere of full\nand absolute freedom. A difficult economic situation and\nthe winds of change that are blowing throughout the world\nand are becoming stronger on the eve of a new millennium\nhave focused Venezuela?s political debate on the idea of\nchange. I am nevertheless convinced that, despite the\nchange Venezuela envisages, its people?s love for liberty\nand democracy as the best system of government and its\ncommitment to fight for peace and understanding among\nall nations will remain unaltered.\nMay I remind the Assembly that, although our fight\nfor political independence was perhaps the bloodiest of\nthe nineteenth century, we have not had a single violent\nconflict with any other country since the birth of our\nRepublic. In international forums, Venezuela has\ndistinguished itself by its constant support for universal\npeace and has always made its modest contribution to any\ninitiative in favour of justice and peace. That is why I can\nassure the Assembly that the next Government of\nVenezuela, whatever the electorate may decide, will\ncontinue to follow the same path within the United\nNations. The Organization can rely on Venezuela for\nanything relating to service to any and all human beings,\nor to friendship, cooperation and peace among nations,\nand anything required by the fight against crime, poverty,\ndrug-trafficking, terrorism, hatred, discrimination \u2014 all\nthe evils that have beset humanity. We trust that the\nUnited Nations will always stand against those evils as a\nshield against adversity and a beacon of hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to welcome at the\noutset the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nthird session. He has assumed a difficult and important\ntask, and we have full confidence in his ability to give\nthis body the direction required at a time when many\ncomplex issues are on its agenda.\nI would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan, who has continued to represent our Organization\nin an outstanding manner and to whom we are all\nindebted for initiating a comprehensive reform process.\nHis presentation of the report on the work of the\nOrganization at the beginning of the general debate has\nprovided us with a clear picture of where the United\nNations stands today and of the major issues we must\naddress.\nWe remain committed to the reform process and\nhope that the ongoing changes will bring about the\nurgently needed improvement in the financial situation of\nthe Organization. We share the Secretary-General?s deep\nconcern at the deterioration of the security situation of\nUnited Nations personnel involved in field operations and\nthe view that determined action by the General Assembly\nis needed to address this problem, which poses a threat to\nmany core activities of the United Nations. On the\npositive side, we share the satisfaction felt at the entry\ninto force of the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-\npersonnel Mines next spring and are pleased to announce\nthat Liechtenstein will deposit its own instrument of\nratification very soon.\nAfter a series of major conferences in the first half\nof this decade, we now have to tackle the important task\nof addressing the follow-up processes to these major\nevents, in order to ensure that the relevant final\ndocuments are implemented on the national and\ninternational levels and thus translated into concrete\naction for the benefit of people worldwide.\nThis year, we celebrate both the adoption of the\nVienna Declaration and Programme of Action five years\nago and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights in 1948, which is usually referred to as the\n32\n\n\n\u201c50 plus 5\u201d anniversary. We hope this event will send a\npowerful message to the world that the United Nations and\nits Member States are aware of the need for genuine and\neffective national policies and international cooperation in\norder to achieve the standards established in this area by\nthe United Nations.\nThe Universal Declaration constitutes a milestone in\nthe history of human rights activities of the United Nations\nand the basis for the remarkable achievements made over\nthe following years and decades. Therefore, it is our view\nthat on 10 December we should reaffirm in strong and clear\nterms the contents of this Declaration, as well as our\ncommitment to fully implement its provisions, in order to\nensure that all individuals worldwide benefit from the\nstandards set out in the Declaration.\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action\nhave been a key element in the human rights deliberations\nfor half a decade now. The value and importance of this\ndocument have become very clear during this period of\ntime, while the implementation of many of its contents has\nbeen slow and not satisfactory. The Vienna document is\ncomplementary to the previously existing instruments and\nstandards in the field of human rights.\nOur main task is to ensure that these high-quality\nstandards under international law are made a reality in daily\nlife for people worldwide, since there continues to be a\nvery noticeable deep gap between these standards and their\nimplementation in practice. I am pleased to announce that\nthe Liechtenstein parliament has approved accession to the\nInternational Covenants on Human Rights, as well as to the\nprotocols to the second Covenant.\nWe fully subscribe to the principle that all human\nrights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and have\nthus to be treated on the same footing. There is, however,\none area to which we would like to give particular\nemphasis, namely, the promotion and protection of the\nrights of children, which warrant our special attention. The\nscope and number of violations of the rights of the child\nare particularly disturbing, and we are grateful to note that\nthe international community has in the recent past stepped\nup its efforts to combat some of the most outrageous forms\nof such violations. Another welcome and necessary measure\nis the appointment of a Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General on children in armed conflicts. We\npledge our full support to the activities undertaken by\nMr. Olara Otunnu and express our hope that his office will\nbe provided with the necessary human and financial\nresources to fulfil its far-reaching and complex tasks. We\nare disappointed that it has not yet been possible to adopt\nan optional protocol on children in armed conflicts, which\ncould make a major contribution in this respect.\nA very important and timely impetus to the cause of\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law was\nprovided by the adoption of the Statute of an International\nCriminal Court this summer in Rome. While the\nInternational Criminal Court is not a human rights court,\nwe consider the Rome Statute to be a very important\ncontribution to Human Rights Year. We welcome the\noutcome of the Rome Conference as an achievement of\ntruly historic dimensions and \u2014 like the Ottawa\nprocess \u2014 as an example of the fruitful role civil society\ncan play in an intergovernmental negotiating process of\nhigh complexity. While we would have preferred to give\nthe International Criminal Court more far-reaching\ncompetence, we are very satisfied and encouraged to note\nthat what seemed like a dream just a few years ago now\nhas a chance to become a reality. It is of crucial\nimportance to realize that the adoption of the statute was\nnot the end of the process, but, rather, a decisive step\nwhich requires determined follow-up and further hard\nwork from all of us. Constructive and serious work in the\nPreparatory Commission and a speedy process of\nsignature and ratification are the most important tasks for\nthe imminent future, and we hope that the General\nAssembly will send out a strong message to this end. As\na participant in the Rome Conference and as one of the\nfirst signatories of the Statute, Liechtenstein stands ready\nto make its contribution.\nOne of the most disturbing developments in the past\nyear took place in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.\nLiechtenstein continues to condemn all nuclear tests and\nhas expressed its concern at the impact of the tests\nconducted this year on political stability in the region\nconcerned. This matter touches on the very existence of\nhumankind, and thus we have to make every effort to\ncreate a non-proliferation regime which is just, effective\nand credible. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968 and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 constitute, if fully\nimplemented, two cornerstones of such a regime. Other\nmeasures will be necessary, and it is of crucial\nsignificance that all countries stand ready to make their\ncontribution to solving this issue in the interest of all of\nus.\nOur own region has been affected by the crisis in the\nformer Yugoslavia for many years now. We all welcomed\nthe conclusion of the Dayton Agreements, because they\n33\n\n\nbrought an end to the terrible suffering of the people in the\nformer Yugoslavia. We remain concerned, however, at the\nslow process of implementation, especially with regard to\nthe civilian aspects of the Agreements.\nThe year 1998 has brought about a new crisis of\nalarming dimensions: the conflict in Kosovo. Liechtenstein\ncondemns the numerous and serious violations of\ninternational humanitarian law in this conflict and remains\nvery concerned about the situation of the civilian population\nand the potential impact of the developments in Kosovo on\nregional stability. Preventing a further deterioration of the\nhumanitarian situation and finding a viable political solution\nare the two most important issues for a solution to the\nKosovo crisis, which poses a clear threat to international\npeace and security and should therefore be dealt with\nappropriately by the United Nations. It has become clear\nonce again that the capacity of our Organization to deal\nwith such challenges needs to be enhanced and improved.\nAs with other crises in the recent past, most notably the one\nin Rwanda, the outbreak of violence in Kosovo came as a\nsurprise to nobody, and yet not enough was done to prevent\nit.\nFurther developing the concept of prevention and\ntranslating it into concrete action remains, therefore, in our\nview, one of the most important issues on the agenda of the\nUnited Nations, and the increased involvement of women\nin preventive diplomacy continues to be of particular\nimportance to us. We note with gratitude the signs of an\nincreased political will to support the concept of prevention,\nwhile we believe that more concerted and determined\nefforts to this end have to be made. We are ready to make\nour contribution, and I would like to recall in this context\nonce again our initiative on the right of self-determination.\nWe are more convinced than ever that a more innovative\nand flexible application and implementation of this right has\ngreat potential to defuse tensions and prevent conflicts\nwithin States \u2014 the type of conflicts with which the\ninternational community is most commonly faced these\ndays. A genuine political dialogue between central\nGovernments and communities living within States lies at\nthe heart of our ideas, the ultimate goal of which is the\nprevention of tendencies by such communities to claim\nstatehood and attempt to achieve this goal through violent\nmeans. The Liechtenstein Research Programme on Self-\ndetermination, conducted at Princeton University, has\ncontinued and increased its activities over the past year, and\nwe have noted with great satisfaction and gratitude the\ninterest and contributions from a large number of\npermanent missions in New York. We will continue to try\nand enhance political support for our ideas, which we hope\ncan make a contribution to the effectiveness of our\nOrganization in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to sincerely congratulate\nthe President on his unanimous election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and to\nexpress confidence that under his efficient leadership the\nAssembly will cope successfully with the complex issues\nbefore it.\nI would like to express our special gratitude to\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, whose vast experience and great\nprofessionalism greatly contributed to the success of the\nprevious session, and whose work as President during the\nfifty-second session epitomized the United Nations\ncommitment to the process of transformation aimed at\nenhancing the effectiveness of the Organization.\nAll aspects of life in Azerbaijan are covered by the\nprocess of radical reform directed at creating a\ndemocratic, secular society governed by the rule of law\nand based on a market economy. In spite of the current\nobjective difficulties caused by the consequences of\narmed conflict and the problems inherent in the\ntransitional period, Azerbaijan does not see any alternative\nto the course of democratic transformation it has taken,\nand considers the strengthening of its democratic\ninstitutions a priority of its State policy.\nRespect for fundamental political and civil rights and\nfreedoms, the functioning of the multi-party system, the\nprotection of the interests of each citizen in our society\nirrespective of ethnic origin, independence of the\njudiciary, as well as the advancement of other elements of\ndemocratic society, are guaranteed by the Constitution of\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, which was adopted on 12\n13\n\n\nNovember 1995 in a national referendum. A great deal has\nbeen done to bring the legislative system of the country in\nline with relevant international standards.\nPresidential elections that are to take place in\nAzerbaijan on 11 October this year will constitute a\nmilestone in the process of further strengthening the\ndemocratic foundation of the society. Actions already\nundertaken by the leadership of the country have laid the\nfoundation for genuinely free and just elections. A new law\non presidential elections in the Republic of Azerbaijan was\nthoroughly examined by the Office for Democratic\nInstitutions and Human Rights of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nCouncil of Europe and meets the most rigorous\ninternational standards in this field.\nThe election process will be observed by 300\ninternational monitors from the OSCE, the Council of\nEurope and other international organizations, as well as\nfrom institutions of individual countries, such as the\nNational Democratic Institute for International Affairs in\nthe United States. The widest possible participation of\nnational monitors has been provided for. The leadership of\nthe country has declared its commitment to conducting free\nand just elections, considering it a significant event in the\nhistory of the Azerbaijan State.\nPositive developments resulting from current reforms\ncan also be observed in the country?s economy. At the\ninitial stage of its formation the young Azerbaijan State\nfaced internal instability, lack of a progressive legislative\nbasis for the market economy, disintegration of traditional\neconomic and trade relations, economic recession and a\nhuge budget deficit. These elements have created serious\nobstacles to economic development. Armed aggression by\nneighbouring Armenia has had the most negative impact on\nthe situation in Azerbaijan. It has resulted in the occupation\nof one fifth of its territory, the emergence of about 1\nmillion refugees and internally displaced persons and the\ncontinuance of the 10-year-old blockade of the Nakhichevan\nregion of Azerbaijan by Armenia.\nThe course of building a democratic society based on\na market economy, taken by the leadership of the country,\nhas created the prerequisites for drastic economic reforms.\nSince 1995, the Government of Azerbaijan has been\nimplementing a comprehensive programme of economic\nstabilization. Fiscal, monetary and credit policies have been\nstreamlined and structural reforms to liberalize the economy\nhave been completed. We have achieved macroeconomic\nstability, as well as stability of the national currency. In\nfact, inflation rates have practically been reduced to zero,\nand since 1996 steady growth in the gross domestic\nproduct has been restored. Internal stability achieved as a\nresult of the leadership?s consistent policy, as well as\nreforms implemented, have provided a favourable climate\nfor investments in the country.\nToday, Azerbaijan continues with the reform of its\nbanking system and privatization of State-owned\nenterprises. I would like to take this opportunity to thank\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for\ntheir support to the stabilization programme in Azerbaijan\nand for financing the structural transformations in its\neconomy. I would like to offer our assurances of the\nirreversibility of the course of economic reforms taken by\nour Government and to express the hope that these\nimportant financial institutions will increase their\nassistance to Azerbaijan.\nIn its economic policy, our country attaches the\nhighest priority to its integration into the world economy.\nSituated at the junction of Eastern and Western\ncivilization, and having been for centuries a link between\nEurope and Asia, Azerbaijan is implementing a systematic\nprogramme aimed at its smooth integration into the world\neconomy, and attaches great importance to the\ndevelopment of fruitful and mutually beneficial regional\ncooperation based on mutual respect for the sovereignty\nand interests of all States, as well as on the principle of\nnon-interference in internal affairs of other countries.\nIn this connection, the country?s leadership regards\nas strategically important the concept of creating an East-\nWest corridor, and in particular the development of the\nEurope-Caucasus-Asia transportation link. The Transport\nCorridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA)\nprogramme, established by the Commission of the\nEuropean Union in 1993, is designed to promote the\ndevelopment of interconnected national and regional\ntransportation infrastructures to enhance cooperation\nbetween countries in Europe, the Black Sea region, the\nCaucasus, the Caspian Sea region and Asia.\nImplementation of this programme will provide reliable\naccess to the trans-European and trans-Asian\ntransportation systems for the landlocked countries of the\nCaucasus and Central Asia. During the last five years\nclose interaction between the States involved in the\nprogramme and active support by the Commission of the\nEuropean Union have contributed to substantial progress\nin modernization and construction of communications, the\ndevelopment of relevant laws and codes and the\n14\n\n\nimprovement of the customs and tariff policies of\nparticipant States.\nThe results of five years of work were reviewed at the\nInternational Conference on the Restoration of the Historic\nSilk Route, held at the capital of Azerbaijan, the city of\nBaku, on 7-8 September this year. That Conference brought\ntogether delegations from 32 countries, including nine heads\nof State, and representatives of 13 international\norganizations. The major outcome of the Conference was\nthe signing of the Principal multilateral agreement on\ninternational transport for development of the corridor\nEurope-Caucasus-Asia, which is an important institutional\nmechanism for promoting the development and regulation\nof international transportation, as well as for coordinating\nand harmonizing transportation policies and legal\nframeworks in this field of transportation. The Baku\nConference has become a major cornerstone in terms of\nstrengthening and enhancing cooperation aimed at the\nfurther development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia\ntransportation corridor in the interests of the economic\nprogress of all the participating States.\nThe delegation of Azerbaijan is counting on the\nsupport of the other Member States for this programme. We\nare convinced that the restoration of the historic silk route\nand the involvement of other countries and regions in this\nproject would provide a strong impetus to the process of\nrapprochement and reciprocal enrichment of our peoples, a\nstrengthening of their independence and sovereignty, as\nwell as the successful implementation in those States of\ndemocratic and market-oriented reforms.\nCarrying out plans to deliver carbohydrate resources\nproduced by Azerbaijan and other countries of the Caspian\nbasin to world markets by means of multiple pipelines is an\nintegral part of the East-West concept, which is of\ninestimable importance for strengthening the independence\nand security of sovereign States, as well as for their\neconomic and other development. We expect international\nfinancial institutions and other investors to show due\ninterest in these projects, which can rightly be called a\nbridge to the third millennium.\nUnfortunately, however, we are obliged to admit that\nthe model of the progressive development of sovereign\nStates of the region proposed by Azerbaijan is not accepted\nby all. The position taken by Armenia in the region still\nremains a serious obstacle to this process.\nThe question of a settlement of the conflict between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan, which has lasted for more than 10\nyears now, is a key issue in Azerbaijan?s foreign policy.\nRelevant resolutions of the Security Council and the\ndecisions of the OSCE have made it possible to create a\nnecessary normative legal basis for the settlement of this\nconflict. In this context, it is necessary in particular to\nstress the codifying role and universality of the principles\ncontained in the Lisbon statement made by the Chairman-\nin-Office of the OSCE. These principles, namely,\nrecognition of the territorial integrity of Armenia and\nAzerbaijan, a high level of autonomy for Nagorny\nKarabakh within the Azerbaijan State and the provision of\nsecurity and safety for the entire population of Nagorny\nKarabakh, are fully in keeping with the principles\nenshrined in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and are\ncomprehensive in nature, which makes possible their\napplication with an equal degree of effectiveness not only\nto the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but to all\nother regional conflicts as well.\nA positive balance has recently been achieved. An\ninstitute of mediation has been created, comprising the\nMinsk Group of the OSCE and its Co-Chairmen. The\nparameters for the settlement process have been\nestablished, providing for the elimination of the\nconsequences of the armed conflict and, on this basis, a\nresolution of the political problems. As a result of\nAzerbaijan?s persistence, it was possible in October 1997\nto find points of contiguity with Armenia?s position, and\nreal opportunities for progress have emerged. The\nsubsequent internal political events in Armenia, however,\nand the resulting drastic revision of its attitudes led to a\ndecline in the dynamism of the Minsk process.\nA just and lasting settlement cannot be achieved by\nArmenia?s military pressure on Azerbaijan, by its\ncontinuing occupation of parts of the territory of the\nRepublic of Azerbaijan and by increasing its military\npotential there, by putting forward preconditions for the\nresumption of negotiations on the basis of the results of\nArmenia?s aggression, or by imposing new procedural\nframeworks on the negotiations process, in order to\nperpetuate the situation resulting from the conflict.\nIllegal transfers of arms from Russia to Armenia,\nworth more than $1 billion, and regular joint military\nexercises of those countries designed to increase the\noffensive potential of the Armenia?s armed forces not\nonly prevent a facilitation of the settlement, but also have\na direct destabilizing impact on the situation in the region.\nAzerbaijan once again states its commitment to a\npeaceful resolution of the conflict and the strict\n15\n\n\nimplementation of the ceasefire regime, until an agreement\non the settlement of the armed conflict is reached, in the\nhopes that the same approach will be taken by the\nArmenian side. Azerbaijan calls on Armenia to accept the\nproposals of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference as\na basis for negotiations within the format of the Minsk\nGroup. Today, as never before, it is important for the\ninternational community to preserve its consistency,\ndetermination and persistence in upholding its declared\nposition on the settlement of the conflict between Armenia\nand Azerbaijan.\nNobody should be in any doubt that progressive\ndevelopment of the States of the region can only be\nachieved through the establishment of just and lasting peace\nand stability in the southern Caucasian region on the basis\nof respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of its\nStates. Azerbaijan believes that international organizations,\nas well as the entire international community, should more\nactively utilize their potential to further promote the\npeaceful negotiation process and the achievement of a\npolitical settlement to the conflict.\nDuring its last session, in response to the\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General, the General\nAssembly adopted important decisions aimed at reforming\nthe Organization. Azerbaijan regards the work already done\nto this end as a solid basis for further adaptation of the\nOrganization to the quickly changing needs and imperatives\nof today?s world. We stand ready to further contribute to\nthe implementation of these decisions intended to prepare\nthe world Organization better to meet the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century.\nUndoubtedly, in this regard, the reform of the Security\nCouncil is of special importance. In our view, it is\nexpedient to adopt relevant decisions on this extremely\nsensitive issue on the basis of the broadest support of\nMember States and in accordance Article 108 of the\nCharter. Asia, Africa and Latin America should be\nrepresented in both categories of membership of the\nSecurity Council in a manner appropriate to current political\nrealities. Given the fact that the number of countries in the\nEastern European Group has doubled, we once again point\nout the need to allocate to that Group an additional non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council.\nAddressing the question of the reform of the Security\nCouncil and the enhancement of the efficiency of its work,\nwe cannot fail to draw attention to the fact that the four\nSecurity Council resolutions on the conflict between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan have still not been implemented.\nWe have repeatedly stressed that a review of the\npersonnel policy of the United Nations should be an\nintegral part of the Organization?s reform. We remain\nextremely concerned by the fact that the Republic of\nAzerbaijan is still not represented in the Secretariat.\nIt is unfortunate that emergencies arising from\nmilitary conflicts and acts of military aggression are still\na pressing issue today. Millions of people continue to lose\ntheir homes, health and property, and are becoming\ninternally displaced persons.\nThe people of my country have experienced the pain\nand misfortune of such a loss, having fallen victim to the\nArmenian aggression of which I have spoken. Every\nseventh citizen of Azerbaijan bears the burdens of the\nrefugee?s life, deprived of his home in his native land,\nsuffering from heat in summer and cold in winter in\ntemporary tent camps. In occupied Azerbaijani territory,\nhundreds of towns and villages have been destroyed,\npractically all of the houses, schools, hospitals and\nindustrial facilities have been burned down or plundered\nand ancient cultural monuments have been razed. Coping\nwith the refugee emergency and the restoration of what\nhas been lost are two of the main concerns of the\nAzerbaijan State. These problems cannot be resolved until\nthe occupying forces are withdrawn from Azerbaijani\nterritory and all the refugees and displaced persons have\nbeen returned to the places from which they were\nexpelled by force.\nThe Azerbaijan Government is doing a great deal to\nalleviate the situation. The role of the United Nations and\nits agencies in this process can scarcely be overestimated.\nIn addition to providing direct humanitarian assistance to\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, at the present\ntime a project is under way to restore a part of the Fisuli\ndistrict, which was freed from the occupying Armenian\nunits. This project is being carried out by the Government\nof Azerbaijan, the World Bank, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and\nother agencies and organizations. However, the emerging\ntrend of reduction in the volume of humanitarian\nassistance to Azerbaijan cannot fail to disturb us. While\nexpressing our most sincere gratitude to the United\nNations, its specialized agencies and donor countries for\ntheir support and concrete assistance, we call on them not\nto decrease in the future the volume of their humanitarian\naid to the people in Azerbaijan who are suffering from\naggression and who live in the most unbearable\nconditions.\n16\n\n\nI should like to advantage of this opportunity to briefly\nrefer to our cooperation with UNDP, which is playing a\nvery positive role in the social, political and economic\ndevelopment of our country. Assistance from UNDP, the\nmajor source of subsidies necessary for carrying out\ndevelopment activities, is vital to resolve a number of\nserious problems in Azerbaijan that were mentioned earlier.\nWe welcome the system of Resident Coordinators and\nhighly commend the activity of the Resident Coordinator in\nAzerbaijan, designated by the Secretary-General, who is\nacting as the leader of the United Nations team in the\ncountry. At the same time, given the difficult financial\nconstraints facing UNDP, I should like to call upon all\nMember States to increase their voluntary contributions to\nthe budget of the Programme so that the recipient countries,\nincluding Azerbaijan, can more effectively use its potential\nto their advantage.\nThe consolidation of efforts of Member States with a\nview to launching a decisive attack against crime, drugs and\nterrorism continues to be a priority. Combating these\nphenomena can be successful only if all countries truly join\nforces. Azerbaijan, which has had to confront these real\nthreats to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in\nparticular from Armenian terrorism, considers itself an\nactive participant in the fight against these evils.\nAzerbaijan welcomes the results of the Rome\nDiplomatic Conference to establish an International\nCriminal Court. We are convinced that an efficient, capable,\nindependent and authoritative court will contribute to\nstrengthening international cooperation for the effective\nprosecution and suppression of aggression, genocide and\nmilitary crimes, which are the most heinous crimes\nconstituting a threat to international peace and security. As\na State that is experiencing all the sufferings and tragedy of\naggression by Armenia, Azerbaijan is deeply interested in\nthe establishment and effective functioning of international\nlegal mechanisms for the prosecution of those responsible\nfor the aforementioned crimes.\nThere are fewer than 500 days remaining until the end\nof this century, and we have no time to relax, no right to\nrest on our laurels. Approaching the end of the historic\nnineties, the United Nations, bringing together both the\nprosperous States and those who have overcome numerous\ncalamities but have gained their independence and stability,\nmust take all necessary measures to justify the efforts\nalready made and to achieve the objectives that have been\nset. Fulfilment of the tasks at hand and finding solutions to\nthe problems we face constitute the baggage that this\nrespected Organization and its Member States will take\nwith them into the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish first to extend to the\nPresident my warm congratulations on his assumption of\nthe conduct of the current session. Uruguay has indeed a\nmajor role to play in international developments, both at\nthe regional and the international level.\nI also wish to congratulate the current President?s\npredecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for his performance during\nthe fifty-second session. My congratulations and support\nare also addressed to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\nhas deployed enormous efforts not only to keep United\nNations services running, but also to further enhance their\nefficiency through the ongoing reform process. His\npolitical skills have been demonstrated in settling disputes\nwhich threaten international peace and security.\nThe Austrian Foreign Minister delivered a statement\non behalf of the European Union to which my\nGovernment fully subscribes. I would like to elaborate\nfurther on some particular issues.\n27\n\n\nGreece consistently endeavours for peace and\nsecurity \u2014 security in political and socio-economic terms,\nsecurity through human dignity and through international\nlaw and order.\nIn that spirit, Greece welcomes the establishment by\nthe Rome Conference of an International Criminal Court.\nWe hope that the Preparatory Committee, to convene\nin the wake of the Conference, will decisively tackle the\nremaining definition aspects of the crime of aggression.\nGreece considers disarmament and non-proliferation to\nbe guarantees of international peace. In the nuclear field,\nwe welcome two significant developments: the signing of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the\ndecision reached in Geneva to negotiate a treaty banning\nthe production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and\nother explosive nuclear devices.\nMy country shares the general concern about nuclear\ntests. We also concur with the general recommendations on\nthe issue, namely, adherence to the comprehensive test ban\nand the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, as well as compliance with the international\nrules. Bacteriological and toxin weapons, known as the\nnuclear weapons of the poor, remain a threat to humanity.\nReinforcement of the relevant Convention remains an\nurgent priority.\nThe Ottawa Treaty on anti-personnel landmines made\nhistory by totally banning their use. We urge those\ncountries, particularly in the sensitive south-eastern\nEuropean area, that have yet to accede to this Treaty to\nseriously consider the humanitarian aspect of this exercise\nand act accordingly.\nPeacekeeping plays a major role in staving off crises.\nGreece has taken an active part in a wide range of United\nNations operations, such as the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\nObservation Mission, and in the Western Sahara, in\nGeorgia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in the\nUnited Nations humanitarian mission in Iraq and Operation\nALBA in Albania. Greece also provides annually a\nsignificant financial contribution to the United Nations\nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus.\nThe United Nations needs adequate resources and\nmeans in order to carry out its mandate. Greece has\nvoluntarily accepted a higher percentage in the scale of\nassessments and pays its contributions to the Organization\nin full and on time.\nCombating drugs is a high political priority for the\nGreek Government. Greece closely followed the\nproceedings of the General Assembly?s special session on\nthe international drug problem. Last June, my country?s\ncommitment in the fight against drugs was reflected in its\nchairing the regional Dublin Group formation for the\nBalkans and the near Middle East.\nFrom its establishment, the modern Greek State has\nproclaimed that no discrimination based on colour, race\nor ethnic origin would be tolerated on its territory, while\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of all\nindividuals who set foot on it would be fully protected.\nWe have made a tradition of adhering to, implementing\nand supporting compliance with the human rights norms\nset by United Nations instruments and major conventions.\nThe restructuring and new membership of the\nSecurity Council rightly elicit our attention. The\nenlargement of the Security Council should be based both\non the criteria of the United Nations Charter and on the\nongoing realities. We understand that major regional\norganizations, such as the European Union, the Non-\nAligned Movement, the Arab League, the Organization of\nAmerican States, the Organization of African Unity, the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the Southern\nAfrican Development Community, the South Pacific\nForum and other important forums have a special\nresponsibility in identifying those countries which, by\nevident commitment to principles enshrined in the\nCharter, may further subscribe and contribute to its goals.\nOn the other hand, 53 years after the signing of the\nUnited Nations Charter in San Francisco, we have to\nacknowledge the new realities, such as the collapse of the\nbipolar system and the emergence of new stabilizing\nfactors all over the world.\nThe future of this body of countries with limited\nmembership, regardless of their geographical location or\nideological orientation, calls for our consideration. We\nhope that a renewed effort of the Open-ended Working\nGroup, under your guidance, Sir, will eventually reach a\ncompromise solution.\nConcerning the world economy, I share the view that\nglobalization presents us with an array of opportunities\nand potential benefits. Nevertheless, it also entails\nincreased risks. The international community has to make\nfull use of the international financial institutions and\ninstruments to weather crises and respond to the\n28\n\n\nchallenges of globalization. No effort should be spared to\nhelp developing countries, and in particular the least\ndeveloped among them, to avoid marginalization through\nglobalization.\nTwo very important aspects of the effort to better\nintegrate developing countries into the world economy merit\nour consideration: first, the rapid and determined extension\nof debt relief, within the terms of the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative; and secondly, improved\nmarket access so that developing countries can effectively\nbenefit from the trade opportunities that the Uruguay Round\noffers. In this respect, financing for development assistance\nremains an additional element of paramount importance.\nIn the field of environment and sustainable\ndevelopment, Greece supports the work of the appropriate\nUnited Nations Commission. The significance of this forum\ninvites me to recall a grave problem: the threat to the\nenvironment resulting from the expansion of nuclear-power\nproduction plants, particularly when they are located in\nareas subject to earthquakes, neighbouring sea traffic and\ninadequate infrastructure. In addition, we are deeply\nconcerned by the increasing stockpiling of nuclear wastes\nand shipments of radioactive materials, threatening the lives\nand properties of developing countries? populations, in\nparticular those of the vast South Pacific area.\nTurning to my country?s presence in regional\norganizations, may I recall the active role played by Greece\nin the Council of Europe through the Committee of\nMinisters, which it currently chairs. Among the issues on\nits agenda, I note the European Court of Human Rights,\nwhich will enhance the protection of human rights at the\nEuropean level.\nIn the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope, Greece is involved in every effort aimed at\npromoting the notion of comprehensive security. With\nregard to activities in the human dimension, I simply\nmention my country?s contribution in the field of elections\nobservation.\nGreece was happy to attend, as a guest, the twelfth\nNon-Aligned Movement summit held recently in Durban,\nSouth Africa. Its keynote was clearly the shape and scope\nthat a movement born in a bipolar, confrontational world\ncould claim in the coming millennium, ushered in by\nglobalization. The message of the Durban declaration\ndeserves our attention and consideration.\nA year has elapsed since I expressed in this very\nforum the hope that Turkey would finally abandon its\nintransigent policies on Cyprus. It has proven to be a vain\nhope. This was a year of stagnation and frustration.\nFrustrated have been the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan and his Special Adviser, Mr. Cordovez, to\nrelaunch the intercommunal talks. Special envoys from\nseveral countries, including members of the Security\nCouncil, hoping to unblock the situation, came back\nfrustrated from Ankara and the occupied part of Cyprus.\nFrustrated remain the hopes of the European Union to\nbring the Turkish Cypriot together with the Greek Cypriot\nin a prosperous State of Cyprus that is a member of the\nEuropean family.\nThe reaction from Ankara, obediently echoed by the\nTurkish Cypriot leadership, has been one of harsh\nrejection, either in terms of a flat negation or by imposing\nconditions tantamount to cancelling what has been desired\nby the international community, prescribed by United\nNations resolutions and even accepted by the Turkish\nCypriot leadership itself.\nSuch an attitude of rejection is easily explained by\nthe notorious designs of the Turkish Government to effect\nthe partition of Cyprus. Mr. Ecevit, Deputy Prime\nMinister of Turkey, has on several occasions said that the\nCyprus question was resolved once and for all by his\ncountry?s armed forces? invasion in 1974. Twenty-four\nyears after the invasion, Cyprus remains a divided island\nand the Turkish occupation forces increase their presence\nand weaponry, even denying their victims the right to\neffectively defend themselves. Twenty-four years is\nenough. It is time for the international community to\nstrongly support the Secretary-General in fulfilling his\nmandate of bringing the two communities to the\nnegotiating table to initiate a dialogue on gradual\ndisarmament towards the complete demilitarization of the\nisland.\nGreece wishes to establish good-neighbourly\nrelations with Turkey, based on the principles of\ninternational law and respect for international treaties.\nThe International Court of Justice at The Hague,\nwhose compulsory jurisdiction has been accepted by\nGreece, is the appropriate legal forum for the settlement\nof problems in our relations. A positive response by\nTurkey to that effect would constitute a step towards the\nbeginning of a new period of mutual understanding.\n29\n\n\nGreece pursues a policy promoting stability, good-\nneighbourly relations, cooperation and economic\ndevelopment in South-Eastern Europe. We participate in\ninternational projects or take our own initiatives, in the\ncontext of bilateral or multilateral schemes. We offer troops\nand counselling, funds and food. Greece offers to its\nneighbours and the region a much needed feeling of trust\nand security.\nMy country accords a high priority to our relations\nwith Albania. We welcome the efforts of the Albanian\nGovernment to further pursue the process of normalization\nof democratic institutions and its close cooperation with the\ninternational community. Greece considers it its duty to\nstand by Albania in its efforts to overcome the serious\ndifficulties it faces.\nIn the neighbouring Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nand more particularly in the area of Kosovo, the situation\nhas reached a critical point. The vicious circle of the use of\nforce must be halted. The refugees and displaced persons\nmust be allowed to return to their homes safely, without\ndelay. Greece has sent humanitarian assistance to alleviate\nthe plight of the refugees in northern Albania. We welcome\nthe setting up of the Albanian negotiating group, and\nsupport the immediate start of negotiations with a view to\narriving, as soon as possible, at a peaceful and negotiated\nsolution on the future autonomy status of Kosovo, within\nthe internationally recognized borders of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Terrorist acts and indiscriminate\nand disproportionate repression are unacceptable. Greece\nhas actively participated, and will actively participate, in all\ninternational efforts aimed at securing a peaceful solution\nin Kosovo.\nIn Bosnia, Greece notes with satisfaction the progress\nachieved so far in the implementation of the Dayton Peace\nAgreement. We maintain close relations with the Bosnian\nparties and offer substantial contributions to efforts aimed\nat ensuring the stability and development of this country.\nGreek soldiers participate in the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\nas well as in international observer missions. Important\nprogrammes undertaken by the Greek Government in the\nframework of the donors conference, held in 1997, are\nabout to be completed.\nIn our relations with Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia and Romania, the promotion of\nmutually beneficial cooperation in all fields is of paramount\nimportance.\nIn the multilateral field, Greece is committed to, and\nactively involved in, such regional schemes as the South-\nEastern Europe cooperation process, the Royaumont\nInitiative, the South-East Europe Cooperative Initiative\nand the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. We note with\nsatisfaction that South-Eastern Europe leaders will meet\nagain this year in Antalya, Turkey, thus consolidating the\nprocess we initiated last year in Crete.\nIn the Middle East, the present stagnation underlines\nthe urgent need to reactivate the peace process. Its revival\nwill bring hope for peace and prosperity. Once more, we\nstress the need for full implementation of the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions and agreements, and we urge\nthe parties to make every effort to achieve real peace,\nwhich should be a just, lasting and global peace. Greece\nwelcomes any endeavour likely to produce positive\nresults, while supporting the initiatives undertaken by the\nEuropean Union?s special envoy in the Middle East.\nSuccessful meetings organized by the special envoy and\nthe Greek Government bring together prominent Israelis\nand Palestinians in a conciliatory spirit. These meetings\nwill, hopefully, be institutionalized as the \u201cAthens\nDialogue for Peace and Cooperation in the Middle East\u201d.\nThe Mediterranean remains our life companion. We\nhave been the pioneers for the adoption of a European\nUnion Mediterranean policy, accompanied by the Euro-\nMediterranean Partnership (MEDA) regulation, through\nwhich financial aid to the countries concerned is\nconsiderably increased.\nThe African continent is an emerging reality that\nwill affect the future of humanity. However, progress in\nthe fields of political pluralism and economic stabilization\nhas been coupled, over the course of the last year, with\nregression in the form of ruinous civil wars or border\nconflicts in a number of African countries. The\ninternational community should stand by the African\nnations and their organizations on the eve of the twenty-\nfirst century, advocating the need for good-neighbourly\nrelations and, within the countries themselves, democratic\nrule, respect for human rights and an open market\neconomy.\nGreece shares the general concern about the\ndevelopments in Asia. The financial turmoil is by no\nmeans settled. Indeed, it is still sending disturbing\nvibrations through the European and world economies.\nAsia can, however, overcome the crisis. Allowing external\nor internal tensions to drag on, with the prospect of\nescalation, obviously spells future disaster, in terms of\n30\n\n\nchasing or scaring foreign investment out of the area and of\nfunnelling precious funds to such dangerous and vain\nprojects as the production of weapons of mass destruction.\nGreece follows closely and contributes actively to the\nhistorical process of eastern European countries?\nreintegration into the European system. Our political credo\nand vision is that of a Europe without dividing lines and\nscars from the past. In this context, Greece supports the\nenlargement of the European Union with the 10 candidate\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe, together with\nCyprus, advocating the simultaneous launching of a global\nand inclusive accession process with all candidate countries.\nGreece also extends its institutional links and promotes\nits historical, economic and cultural ties with the Russian\nFederation and the Ukraine and the other newly\nindependent States in the Caucasus, Black Sea and Central\nAsia.\nOur excellent relations with the United States and\nCanada are further enhanced through political and military\ncooperation in peacemaking initiatives and peacekeeping\nactivities in South-Eastern Europe, as well as cooperation\nin preventing and eliminating terrorism. Furthermore,\nGreece, as a member of the European Union, stands for a\nbroad transatlantic dialogue and the advancement of the\nNew Trans-Atlantic Agenda.\nGreece has traditional ties of friendship with the\ncountries of Latin America, and, both bilaterally and as a\nmember of the European Union, systematically supports\nongoing, comprehensive dialogue and cooperation with\nthem.\nUntil very recently Greece had been a recipient of\ndevelopment assistance, but for three years now we have\nbeen an important contributor, equal to the standards of the\nDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We may\nnot be such a wealthy country, but we are trying to grant\neffective and qualitative assistance to those interested in it\nand in need of it, using our experience to make this as\nbeneficial as possible, supporting the struggle against\npoverty and famine and for economic and social\ndevelopment, and also trying to help promote human rights,\ndemocracy and institutions of civil society.\nI would like also to refer briefly to an issue which is\nof particular concern to my country, the Olympic Games.\nInspired by the Olympic Ideal, Greece presented on 4\nFebruary 1998 to the International Olympic Committee in\nNagano, Japan, a comprehensive proposal outlining a set\nof organizational structures and a broad range of activities\naimed at the practical realization of an Olympic Truce at\nthe Athens Games of 2004 and at the strengthening of the\nrole of the Olympic Movement. In order to support these\nimportant activities, Greece proposed the establishment of\nan international centre for the Olympic Truce, at the very\nsite of ancient Olympia.\nFurther, Greece took the initiative and proposed the\ncreation of a cultural Olympics for the first time in\ncontemporary world. This would strengthen dialogue\namong different cultures the world over. This proposal\nwas welcomed by the International Olympic Committee,\nand preparatory work has already started between the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), the International Olympic\nCommittee and the Greek Government.\nI would like to spare the delegates another pre-\nelectoral speech. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nthe Netherlands preceded me, I had to scale down my\nspeech and become very modest, but I cannot avoid\nreferring to the candidacy of Greece for the 1999-2000\nterm for one of the two non-permanent seats allocated to\nthe Group of Western European and Other States on the\nSecurity Council.\nMy Government has legitimate and justified\nambitions for requesting the support of United Nations\nmember countries to such a distinction. Our long-standing\nforeign policy is dedicated to world peace and security, to\nthe trend of decolonization and self-determination, to\nassisting developing and less developed countries and to\nrespect for international law and human rights.\nWe condemn terrorism in all its forms.\nWe are in favour of the independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of all United Nations Member\nStates and of the implementation of the provisions of the\nUnited Nations Charter, including the democratic principle\nof fair and balanced representation of all Member States\nin the various organs and agencies of the United Nations.\nI would like to draw the honourable delegates?\nattention to this last principle. In the Western European\nGroup, a situation is occurring in which very few\nmembers \u2014 five of them \u2014 have by now served during\n44 of the 52 years of this Organization?s existence. Small\nand average-sized countries should also have a chance to\nbe present on the Security Council, and I am proud to\n31\n\n\nrepresent one of those average-sized countries, as I propose\nmy country?s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am convinced that he will guide us\nwisely through the fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe world community is now confronted with\nseveral dangerous situations which threaten the existence\nof millions of people, situations which demand immediate\naction by our Organization. I would like to draw special\nattention to the plight of the people of Kosovo and the\nalarming situation in several countries in Africa, where\nwars have caused appalling suffering and directly threaten\nthe development and advancement of the whole continent.\nOur Organization is also confronted with issues of a\nuniversal nature which can determine the future of\nhumankind, such as the protection of the environment and\nthe delicate balance between economic growth and the\nconservation of natural resources. In this respect, the\nprotection of the oceans and the marine ecosystem is one\nof the most important tasks facing us today.\nThe fact that this is the International Year of the\nOcean allows me to draw the Assembly?s attention to the\nfact that the oceans are the single largest source of protein\nand a crucial part of Earth?s ecosystem. We have to come\nto grips with the reality that the ocean?s bounty is finite\nand that the ocean is not a bottomless receptacle of\nhuman waste and pollution.\nPollution of the seas from land-based sources\nremains a daunting problem. However, effective\nimplementation of the Washington Global Programme of\nAction will certainly bring about much improvement in\nthis respect. Pollution by persistent organic pollutants is\nanother major concern. Prompt completion by the year\n2000 of a legally binding instrument dealing with some of\nthese pollutants will be an important step towards\nreducing and eventually eliminating this kind of pollution.\nAccidents in which radioactive material from nuclear\nwaste treatment plants has spilled into the sea have\ndemonstrated clearly the dangers of such facilities. Under\n34\n\n\nno circumstances should such plants be allowed to operate\nnear the ocean. It is my hope that our generation will take\nthe necessary measures so that future generations inherit\nclean oceans free from contamination.\nNations with similar interests must strive for\nagreements on sharing and sensibly managing common\nstocks and fisheries on the high seas. We must ensure that\nthe harvesting of living marine resources can continue and\nthat economic development and conservation go hand in\nhand. In order to ensure a vibrant and profitable fisheries\nsector, States need to introduce the principles of private\nenterprise into the fishing industry and make its products\ncompete on the free market. In Iceland we have devised a\nmarket-driven fisheries management system which\nencompasses both conservation of our resources and their\nsustainable use.\nThe fishing stocks in the exclusive economic zone\naround Iceland have been steadily growing since a system\nof individual transferable fishing quotas was implemented\nin order both to achieve desired economic objectives and to\nprotect our resources. However, fisheries in many parts of\nthe world are overexploited. In my view, this is mainly due\nto the fisheries sector?s being inundated with government\nsubsidies, resulting in excess fishing capacity and the\ndistortion of market principles. No other single action could\nbring about such positive results, in a short time, towards\nachieving sustainable development in fisheries as the\nelimination of government subsidies.\nI would like to note that when we read United Nations\npublications dealing with the state of the world?s fisheries\nwe are continually confronted with the expression\n\u201coverfishing\u201d, not \u201cfishing\u201d. This implies, first, that\nfisheries everywhere are utilized to the hilt, and, secondly,\nthat States in general have failed in the management of the\nresources inside their economic zones. This gives a wrong\npicture of the situation.\nI wish to draw the Assembly?s attention to an\ninteresting study issued a few weeks ago by the World\nWildlife Fund on the root causes of the depletion of fish\nresources in many parts of the world. The study states that\novercapacity in fishing fleets is a key factor and that\nGovernment subsidies of this industry is another. It rightly\npoints out that one solution to this problem would be to\nissue each fishing vessel tradeable rights to a percentage of\nthe catch. It goes on to say that this system has worked\nwell in New Zealand, Australia and Iceland.\nIn the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange we stressed that the further harnessing of\nIceland?s abundant, clean and renewable energy sources\ncould contribute towards the global effort to limit\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Iceland has for decades placed\nspecial emphasis on the utilization of clean and renewable\nenergy sources, such as geothermal energy and\nhydropower. Of its own accord, and through extensive\ninvestment, Iceland has replaced fossil fuels for space\nheating and electricity generation with clean and\nrenewable energy sources. Those efforts, made prior to\n1990, have severely limited the possibilities for Iceland to\nfurther reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.\nIn our view, it must be recognized that the economy\nof some countries is dependent on few natural resources.\nThey therefore have fewer options to secure their\neconomic base by comparison with countries with diverse\neconomies. It is both illogical and unfair to deny countries\nthe right to harness and utilize clean and renewable\nenergy. Such a result would run counter to the objective\nof the Convention and be incompatible with Agenda 21.\nThis year?s substantive session of the Economic and\nSocial Council demonstrated clearly that the industrialized\ncountries must make a concentrated effort to remove\nbarriers to trade and integrate the developing countries\ninto global markets. Many developing countries now have\nflourishing private sectors, competing in world markets.\nLast month I had the pleasure of visiting some\ncountries in the southern part of Africa, of observing the\nenormous human and natural wealth of these countries\nand of learning first hand about the possibilities available\nto the people there. It is clear that peace has brought\nprosperity to those countries. My country is engaged in\ndevelopment cooperation in that area, focusing on human\ncapacity-building as well as training and education in the\nfield of fisheries. It should be stressed that, parallel to the\nprivatization of the economy, there must be increased\nfunding for building up social services, health care and\neducation. It is my firm intention that Iceland shall\nincrease its official development assistance to our partner\ncountries in Africa. This fall, I had the pleasure of\nwelcoming the first students, coming from three African\ncountries, of the new United Nations University Fisheries\nTraining Programme in Iceland. We hope that in the\nfuture students from all parts of the world will come for\ntraining in all aspects of the fishing industry.\n35\n\n\nI would especially like to draw attention to the\nimportance of strengthening the position and role of women\nin society, mainly with regard to their education and active\nparticipation in the economy. In this respect, we have to\ntackle the problem of overpopulation with comprehensive\nsolutions.\nThe volatility in the world?s financial markets has led\nto severe recession in many countries and slowed economic\ngrowth in others. Globalization is a part of the development\nof the world today, and for all countries it entails both risks\nand benefits. The risks must be borne by all, and the\nbenefits must be spread evenly and widely, especially to the\npoorest.\nOur Organization has seldom had more urgent tasks\nthan preserving peace, security and human rights. I would\nlike to express great concern over the nuclear tests recently\nconducted by two countries in South Asia, and I welcome\nrecent statements by those States that they will adhere to\nthe provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty.\nWar has visited many countries since we gathered here\nlast year. Keeping peace requires our constant vigilance. In\nseveral African countries war and ethnic tension have\nbrought death and destruction. The cruel fate of children in\nwar is more evident now than ever before. Once again the\npeople of the former Yugoslavia are confronted with a\nproblem of tragic proportions. In Kosovo thousands of\nrefugees are facing hunger and a cold winter.\nConflicts where the civilian population is targeted are\nabhorrent and leave scars that take a long time to heal. We\nnow recognize that preserving peace demands more\nintensive measures than before, such as the strengthening of\ndemocratic institutions, policing, overseeing elections,\nestablishing judiciary systems and monitoring human rights.\nIn many countries it is as though the Middle Ages had\nnever ended and the darkness of intolerance, cruelty and\nhuman rights abuses descends on people?s lives every day.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights\nshould encourage us to be stalwart in our principles. Human\nrights are universal, and the veil of religion and tradition\ncannot and will not be accepted as an excuse for tolerating\nflagrant human rights violations.\nThe international community must deal successfully\nwith problems such as terrorism and war crimes. The world\ncommunity has had to look on in horror as terrorists have,\nin cowardly fashion, targeted innocent people going about\ntheir everyday lives. We urge States to sign and ratify the\ncounter-terrorism conventions. The adoption of the Statute\nof the International Criminal Court this summer in Rome\nshows the firm commitment of the international\ncommunity to let law take precedence over lawlessness\nand justice over injustice. Once the court is firmly in\nplace it is our hope that criminals who commit atrocious\nacts, such as crimes against humanity, genocide and war\ncrimes, will have no escape from the long reach of\ninternational law. We urge all States to sign and ratify the\nStatute.\nWe look forward to the effective implementation of\nthe agreed outcome of the General Assembly?s special\nsession on drugs. Enhancing judicial cooperation and law\nenforcement cooperation is essential, as well as bearing\ndown on money-laundering worldwide. The elimination of\nillicit crops should be a high priority in the global drug\ncontrol strategy.\nWe strongly support the Norwegian and Canadian\ninitiative to control the proliferation of small arms and\nlight weapons. The huge number of these weapons should\nbe of great concern to the international community.\nOur Organization must enter the next millennium as\nan effective and reformed Organization, with lean\nmanagement, result-based budget, increased action\npotential in the most vital fields, strengthened finances\nand a clear commitment from all Member countries to\npay their contributions without conditions.\nFinally, Iceland is committed to the ideals of the\nUnited Nations. We have always been ready to shoulder\nour responsibilities in every aspect of the Organization?s\nwork because we believe that all Member countries\nshould make their mark on events shaping the world we\nlive in today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to join previous speakers in\ncongratulating Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. There is\nno doubt that his experience and wisdom will be very\nuseful in effectively guiding our work. I should also like to\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine, for his valuable contribution to the work of this\nOrganization and its reform process.\nAfter the euphoria following the end of the cold war,\na period of frustration and disillusionment set in. It has\ntherefore not always been easy to remain optimistic while\nexperiencing everyday realities. Indeed, the profound\nchanges that shook the world left it poorly prepared to deal\nwith old or new challenges.\nRecently, events that have shaken the world?s security\nenvironment and the international economic environment\nhave reminded us of the complexities of the post-bipolar\nperiod by highlighting the multiple and often detrimental\neffects of the inexorable process of globalization that is\ntaking place in all parts of the world. If we are to be in a\nposition to stem the damaging effects of this process, we\nmust strengthen multilateralism and expand international\ncooperation so as to be able to resolve the various\nproblems, often unprecedented in nature, that face\nhumankind at the threshold of the twenty-first century.\nIn this undertaking, the United Nations will be\nneither a world government nor a passive spectator. It\nwill continue to be a unique Organization with special\nresponsibilities for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. It will continue to be a global negotiating\nforum whose purpose is to set consensus-based standards\nand rules in the most diverse spheres of human activity in\norder to help us adapt to the demands of a new age.\nToday?s world is marked by disquieting\ndevelopments: bloody conflicts, terrorist acts, organized\ncrime, the resurgence of ethnic hatred, attempts to\ncircumvent or undermine non-proliferation regimes,\nhuman rights violations causing flows of refugees,\nproblems associated with narcotic drugs, a worrisome gap\nbetween the levels of economic and social development\nof the various parts of the world, environmental\ndegradation, population questions and many other issues\nand dilemmas that are truly global in nature. Despite the\nsetbacks that it will probably encounter in the future\nfulfilment of its mission, the world Organization will\ncontinue to be the centre of worldwide mobilization of\nefforts to prepare the peoples of the United Nations to\ntackle the challenges that lie before them.\nIn order to ensure the success of this operation, we\nmust all make serious and sustained efforts to give new\nimpetus to the United Nations reform process and to\nmaintain its dynamism. The difficulties encountered along\nthe way should not discourage us from the quest to\nidentify what is possible and feasible, while keeping in\nmind and striving to achieve what is desirable.\nFrom this rostrum, we wish to reaffirm our\ncommitment to promoting the revitalization of our\nOrganization and the reform of the Security Council. As\nfar as expanding the membership of the Council is\nconcerned, our position has not changed. We continue to\nadvocate expanding the Council in both categories,\npermanent and non-permanent, and the inclusion of\nGermany and Japan, among others, in the category of\npermanent members. On the subject of United Nations\nreform, I should like to add that organizational and\nstructural measures must go hand in hand with efforts to\nestablish financial stability for the Organization if they are\nto be effective.\nDomestically the historic transition that has taken\nplace in Hungary over the last decade has been a complex\n20\n\n\nand difficult experience for the country?s population. After\nliving through this arduous period and in the light of the\npromising developments in the country, our country today\nneeds to be reassured about its future. Our people wish to\nsee moral and social renewal in the country and to benefit\nfrom it. Externally, the new Hungarian Government\ncontinues to base its policy on the same principles that its\npredecessors followed starting in 1990, when a democratic\nregime was established in Hungary. It is inspired by the\nnational interests of the country and the values that it shares\nwith its partners on both sides of the Atlantic. It intends to\nremain a factor for stability and security in the Central\nEuropean region. Along with its future allies in the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and in the European\nUnion, it stands ready to contribute to the endeavours of the\ncommunity of nations to ensure respect for international\nobligations and, where necessary, to take effective measures\nto resist actions that are in defiance of its legitimate will.\nOur efforts, which are aimed at having Hungary join\nthe Euro-Atlantic consolidating structures, are motivated by\nour desire for security and economic prosperity, as well as\nby the emotional desire to see a historic reunion with the\nrest of Europe after a long, imposed separation. These\naspirations are fully in keeping with the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations. Not only do they not\nconflict with them, but they complement and enrich in a\nvery positive way our present activities in the world\nOrganization. They will serve to strengthen our specific\nparticipation in various United Nations activities.\nObviously, becoming a member of these consolidating\nstructures will not change Hungary?s place on the world\nmap. It will not be transported to some other planet. It will\nremain an integral part of our world, sharing with other\nnations great and small, rich and poor, the bright as well as\nthe gloomier aspects of globalization.\nProblems such as international crime and terrorism, the\nproliferation of weapons, drug-trafficking and questions\nassociated with migration or environmental pollution \u2014 all\nthese phenomena affect my country as they do others, and\ncall for national, regional and international action. They\nmay jeopardize the institutional structures of democracy and\nparalyse social and economic stability in a particular\ncountry and beyond its borders. The resurgence that we\nhave seen in acts of terrorism should also bolster the\ninternational community?s determination to establish\ninternational cooperation on the largest possible scale so as\nto combat this evil by the most efficient means. The centre\nof these operations should be the United Nations, which\nwill give these endeavours coherence and real universality.\nHungary attaches great importance to developing and\nexpanding regional and subregional cooperation with its\nneighbours. It has a vital interest in seeing stability and\ndemocracy flourish among its neighbours. It considers the\nvarious forms of regional and subregional cooperation to\nbe invaluable and indispensable tools for achieving these\nobjectives. It is ready to participate actively in this regard.\nIt should be noted that one of the driving forces for\nthe implementation by the countries of the region of\npositive measures for socio-economic progress is precisely\ntheir shared wish to join the structures of Euro-Atlantic\nintegration. Hungary has often spoken out in favour of\nthese aspirations and will continue to support them.\nIn this regard, we feel that respect for the rule of\nlaw and institutional guarantees of the full enjoyment of\nhuman rights, including those of national minorities, are\nnot simply key prerequisites to membership of these\nintegration structures. They are also an indispensable and\nvital factor for the establishment of social peace within\ncountries themselves.\nIn speaking of the eastern part of our continent, I\nwould emphasize that, on the one hand, it is impossible\nto transform the region, with its turbulent history of age-\nold coexistence between various ethnic communities, into\na zone of tranquillity and prosperity, and inconceivable to\nconsider healing the deep wounds inflicted by aggressive\nnationalism without taking into account the legitimate\naspirations of national minorities and their desire to\nremain intact as communities and keepers of a specific\nnational heritage, in accordance with the standards\nadopted by the competent international organizations and\nthe practice of the democratic States. On the other hand,\nwe resolutely oppose the policy of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d,\nforced separation and the creation of new kinds of ethnic\nor religious segregation in Europe at the dawn of a new\ncentury.\nHungary is deeply concerned by the deteriorating\nsituation in Kosovo. It shares the view that, without a\ndetermined international commitment, this conflict is\nlikely to spread, with unfathomable consequences for the\nregion and Europe as a whole. We therefore support the\nefforts aimed at stopping this conflict as quickly as\npossible by peaceful and political means. We believe that\nSecurity Council resolution 1199 (1998) can serve to pave\nthe way for this. Hungary hopes that substantive\nnegotiations between the parties can begin without delay\nand that they will lead to a lasting settlement granting\nbroad autonomy to Kosovo while preserving the territorial\n21\n\n\nintegrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this\nrespect, Hungary stresses the primary responsibility borne\nby the Yugoslav authorities in the quest for peace and a\ndemocratic solution.\nThe Balkans have suffered too much for the\ninternational community to permit an escalation of violence,\na return to terror and impunity for human rights violations.\nMy country is prepared, to the extent of its abilities, to\ncontribute to the international community?s action to restore\nlong-term stability and the rule of law in the region.\nWe have also followed with special attention the\ndevelopments in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our primary\nobjective is the full implementation of the Dayton\nAgreement. However, we must accept the fact that,\nfollowing years of bloodshed, savagery and intolerance, the\nprocess envisaged in the Agreement could be more\nprecarious and protracted than we believed and that the\nethnocentric and exclusionary attitudes there may prove to\nbe more entrenched than we had thought. Having said this,\nwe are participating actively in the international effort to\nassist that country in getting back on its feet and to ensure\nthat the terrible years of aggression and horrendous war\nnever return.\nThis year, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Although the\ncommemoration of the birth of that fundamental document\nis a fine occasion for festivities, it is also important that\nnew measures be taken to implement the universal\nstandards embodied in the Declaration so that the United\nNations may, in all places and at all times, not only offer\na ray of hope, but be an effective instrument in the service\nestablishment of United Nations machinery for the\ninternational protection of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms is one of the international community?s great\nachievements, emanating directly from the Universal\nDeclaration. In this context, we welcome the existence of\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights and the establishment, after much hard work,\nof the International Criminal Court.\nGrave and large-scale human rights abuses continue to\nbe committed throughout the world. We have witnessed\nassaults on the freedom of individuals and communities,\nand crude and more subtle discriminatory practices,\nincluding those based on national or religious origin. This\nprompts us to ask the fundamental question as to whether\nthe international community did all it needed to do in good\ntime to prevent these events and used all the means\navailable to it. I am afraid that the answer to these\nquestions is \u201cno\u201d.\nLinking peace to justice and reconciling political\nexpediency and moral considerations have always been\nextremely difficult challenges. Nevertheless, if peace is to\nlast and take firm root, it must be sustained and bolstered\nby democracy, the rule of law and a responsible and\ntransparent system of government. That is why we\nsupport the introduction of the human rights dimension\ninto all United Nations spheres of activity, including\npeacekeeping operations. That is why we insist that those\naccused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the\nvarious conflicts, from the Great Lakes to the former\nYugoslavia, must be brought to justice. The measures\ntaken in this regard deserve the support of all the\nMembers of our Organization.\nWe cannot allow our attention to be distracted from\nthe grave ongoing situations in many regions of our\nworld, where political upheaval, financial crisis and\nnatural disaster render human existence extremely\nprecarious and arduous. The United Nations cannot turn\nits back on these pressing problems. We welcome the\nattention rightly accorded to Africa by the Organization\nand to the search for solutions to its difficulties. Our\nworld is shrinking every day. Therefore, a heightened\nawareness of worldwide concerns and human solidarity is\nvital. For what is at stake today is the future of our\ncivilization and the quality of life of future generations on\nEarth. We must not miss the opportunity offered by the\nend of the century to decide how to improve the lot of the\nhuman race. The United Nations is the best place to\ntackle, without delay, the crucial questions facing\nmankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are\ncelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which has always been, and\ntoday remains, a milestone for democracy and for the\nsafeguard of the inalienable rights of human beings.\nThe Republic of San Marino, during the more than 16\ncenturies of its existence, has always promoted respect for\nhuman rights. Today more than ever before, the principles\ncontained in the Declaration represent the essence of a\ncivilized way of living together in modern society.\nTherefore my Government decided to finance the\nproject of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights entitled \u201cGlobal Dissemination of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\u201d. This project aims\nat making the Declaration accessible and understandable to\na wider number of people, by preparing a compendium of\ntranslations of this important text into 250 of the world\u2019s\nmost widely spoken languages. With this small but\nmeaningful gesture, San Marino wishes to celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Declaration and to make a\ncontribution to the dissemination of the fundamental\nhumanitarian principles contained therein.\nExperience has taught us, at a high cost, that where\nthere is no peace, there is no respect for human rights. I\nbelieve the United Nations should play an active role in the\nmaintenance of peace, especially where it is weakest and\nmost precarious. This is vitally important. It should be the\npersonal responsibility of every human being to carry out\nhis or her own duty in the context of the international\ncommunity.\nSadly, we have recently once again confronted\nanother dramatic issue: the problem of terrorism. We\nmust all cooperate to prevent it from spreading any\nfarther. We must combat terrorism and condemn it,\nalways and by all possible means.\nNuclear tests in the Asian region are a new and\nworrying problem, one that is going to be characteristic\nour era. This problem could represent the beginning of a\nnew season of anxiety and danger for all mankind if the\ninternational community, and the United Nations in\nparticular, is unable to prevent it. The Republic of San\nMarino, like many other States, is against any initiative\naimed at provoking an escalation of the nuclear threat and\nwill do all in its power to prevent this from happening.\nOur generation, and the ones to come, must not know\nthese fears or the destructive ambitions that could\nannihilate our entire planet.\nUnfortunately, in our opinion the present\ninternational legal instruments have proven insufficient to\nfight the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This\nproliferation has taken on a new profile because of the\nwill to acquire a more influential and prestigious position\nat the national and international levels, while the peaceful\nand constructive uses of this energy are forgotten or\ndeliberately denied.\nMy country deems that the United Nations must lead\nthe international community to strengthen those\ninstruments capable of preventing and repressing\ninternational crimes which until now have merely been\nthe object of moral condemnation. With this in mind, our\nRepublic took part in the Diplomatic Conference on the\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court in Rome\nlast June and July. San Marino contributed to the work of\nthe Conference because it is convinced that such a court\ncould represent an effective and strong deterrent to crimes\nagainst peoples or any ethnic group. The court established\nby this Conference will represent not only a hope for but\nalso an instrument of protection for the victims of\noppression, as well as a point of reference for all those\nwho believe in the absolute value of justice and in respect\nfor human beings.\nSan Marino follows with particular attention the\ndebate on the death penalty. Our civil and cultural\nconsciousness entitles us to do so. In 1865, San Marino\nbecame the first country in Europe to abolish capital\npunishment, though in fact it had not been applied for\ncenturies. The Government and people of San Marino\ndeeply believe that death imposed by law cannot represent\n19\n\n\na valid protection for society, nor can it be a deterrent to\ncrime.\nOur criminal code, in which sanctions have a\nrehabilitative as well as a punitive function, rejects capital\npunishment, defining it as \u201ca residual of vindictive justice\u201d.\nFor these reasons, I wish to express the support of the\nRepublic of San Marino for all initiatives that, like the\nresolution adopted this year by the Commission on Human\nRights, aim at the abolition or limitation of the death\npenalty.\nThe nations of the world differ geographically,\nethnically, economically and culturally, but all of them have\na common substantial and undeniable responsibility towards\nyoung people. If we are not able today to put an end to\nwars and poverty, future generations will have to fight\narduous and complex battles arising from the degeneration\nand wounds that currently afflict humanity, as it moves\ntowards the third millennium.\nIt is a question not only of doing away with age-old\ngeopolitical imbalances but, and primarily, of rediscovering\nvalues and principles that are capable of offering all people\nof the world, and especially young people, the cultural\nmeans to fight for freedom, development and mutual\nunderstanding. That is a challenge based on solidarity and\npersonal values. Given that perspective, San Marino\nconsiders the moral and professional growth of young\npeople to be a priority. Our school system is based on\npersonal development, focuses on the job market and\nrespect for environment and encourages young people to\ntake part in the social lives of their communities.\nThe need for reform in the United Nations is a\nconcept widely shared by all Members of this Organization,\nthanks in particular to the input of the Secretary-General,\nwho started a slow but irreversible process which will lead\nto the rationalization and updating of all its principal\norgans. Some of those reforms, such as the reform of the\nSecurity Council, must, because of their significance, be\napproved by consensus only \u2014 a consensus that sadly is\nyet to be reached. We have confidence in the steadfast\ncommitment of the President of the General Assembly and\nin his substantial role in leading the Working Group on the\nreform of the Security Council to an equitable and\nunanimous solution that fully respects the principles of the\nCharter.\nSan Marino is among those countries that are strongly\nconvinced of the need for reform so as to guarantee for the\nUnited Nations the functions and the role that form the\nbasis of its nature and its existence. We are absolutely\naware of how important it is for the Organization to\nstrengthen its presence and its prestige, which derive from\nmore than 50 years of activity in the service of peace and\nthe protection of human rights. We are moreover\nconvinced that this noble mandate has today its own\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre, and that it must be supported with\ndetermination, consistency and loyalty. We should also\nhave the courage and humility to be able to give up\nsomething in the name of the higher interest of all\ncountries and all peoples who form part of the\ninternational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am convinced that with the effective\ncooperation of the elected members of his Bureau, he will\nspare no effort to ensure the success of our work.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the skill with\nwhich he so honourably discharged his weighty\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session.\nThe fifty-third session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place at a time when my country, the Democratic\n24\n\n\nRepublic of the Congo, is the victim of armed aggression\nby its neighbours, Rwanda and Uganda, that has been\ntaking place since 2 August. The seriousness of the actions\nof these two invading countries, which are States parties to\nthe noble ideals of the charters of the United Nations and\nof the Organization of African Unity (OUA), obliges me to\ndwell at length on this dispute in the hope of helping the\nAssembly understand better the drama that is currently\ntaking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, my\ndear homeland.\nIn order to enable the Assembly better to understand\nthis war and all of its consequences, a brief reminder of the\nfacts is necessary.\nOn 27 July 1998, the President of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Mzee Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, after\nconsultations with his Rwandan and Ugandan counterparts\ntook the sovereign decision to terminate Rwanda\u2019s military\nand technical cooperation and to put an end to the presence\nof foreign troops throughout the national territory.\nWhen Rwanda\u2019s troops left Congolese territory, it was\nnoticed that certain Tutsis of Rwandan origin, called\nBanyamulenge, followed suit.\nA week later, Congolese towns bordering on\nRwanda \u2014 Goma, Bukavu and Uvira \u2014 were seized by\narmed elements that came from that neighbouring country.\nOn 6 August, aircraft started shuttling between Goma\nand Kitona, in the west of the country, via Kigali, over a\ndistance of more than 2000 kilometres. After one of the\ncivilian pilots was killed for refusing to carry out orders,\nthese aircraft were diverted from Goma airport to transport\ntroops and mat\u00e9riel the west, under the direction of Mr.\nJames Kabarehe, the ex-Chief of Staff of the Congo.\nAt the same time, columns of armoured vehicles and\nother military equipment crossed the border from Uganda\nunder the pretext of defending Ugandan interests in the\nCongo.\nDespite the protests of the Congolese Government,\nwhich demanded their immediate withdrawal, Ugandan\ntroops surrounded the town of Bunia in the eastern part of\nthe country on 13 August 1998.\nOn the same day, the Inga hydroelectric dam was\noccupied by the Rwandan-Ugandan coalition forces. They\nsabotaged the installations in order to deprive the capital,\nKinshasa, of electricity and drinking water.\nOn 23 August 1998, Ugandan troops attacked\nKisangani, in the north-eastern part of the country, and\nlater occupied it.\nThese facts, and these acts of violence \u2014 confirmed\nby independent sources \u2014 provide ample proof of the\naggressive involvement of Kigali and Kampala in the\nhuge plot to Balkanize the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, all in defiance of international law and the\nprinciple of the inviolability of borders inherited from the\ncolonial period, pursuant to the Charter of the\nOrganization of African Unity.\nIndeed, one of the two aggressor countries, Uganda,\nmade no bones about admitting publicly that its troops\noccupied certain positions in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo.\nAs can be seen, what some media sources wrongly\ndescribed as a rebellion from the east was simply a\nshameful plot to destabilize my country politically and\neconomically, and the covetous intentions of Rwanda and\nUganda regarding my country\u2019s many natural resources\nwere barely concealed.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is once again\npaying a high price for this war imposed on it from the\noutside. Among the countless examples are the massacres\nof thousands of innocent Congolese, including members\nof religious orders, women, children and elderly people in\nthe east and in the west. These sordid crimes remind us\nof the killing of Hutu refugees by elements of the same\nRwandan Patriotic Army. Further examples include the\nmassive deportations from Kivu towards Rwanda of\npeople whose fate remains unknown; the summary\nexecutions of prisoners of war; the dismantling, sabotage\nand destruction of the industrial, shipping and economic\ninfrastructure of the country, damage which, to date, has\nbeen estimated at about $3 billion for Matadi alone; the\nmore than three-week cut in the provision of electric\npower and water to the capital, Kinshasa, a city of more\nthan 6 million people, which was a real humanitarian\ntragedy, as is illustrated by the fact that large stocks of\nfresh foodstuffs were declared unfit for consumption;\nreports of countless deaths in the hospitals because\ndoctors were unable to work in the conditions required by\ntheir noble profession; and the postponement, sine die, of\nthe polio vaccination campaign mandated by the World\nHealth Organization, with untold consequences on the\nlives of our children, which gravely compromises the\nfuture of our country.\n25\n\n\nDespite the situation of aggression, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, which is a peace-loving nation that\nrespects international conventions reaffirms its commitment\nto the principles of the Charter and its unshakeable faith in\nthe promotion of a culture of peace in the Great Lakes\nregion.\nThe first manifestation of this ideal was demonstrated\nby the Government when it appealed to the Security\nCouncil and the Secretary-General to obtain the immediate\nand unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces.\nUnfortunately, the reaction of the international\ncommunity did not match the gravity of the situation in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Even one of the most\nimportant bodies in the United Nations system \u2014 the\nSecurity Council \u2014 after much procrastination, merely\nissued a few ambiguous statements calling for a ceasefire\nand the withdrawal of foreign troops without, unfortunately,\nspecifying them by name. On the other hand, in similar\ncases \u2014 in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in Kuwait \u2014 the\nSecurity Council dealt with the situation promptly and\npractically to restore peace. Why was there this silence\nfrom the international community, particularly from\nSecurity Council? The Council\u2019s policy of double standards\non this issue could set an unfortunate precedent that could\nseriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations\nand wipe out the reform efforts under way.\nGiven this situation that does no credit to our\ncommunity, the Government of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, mindful of its heavy responsibilities to\nguarantee the territorial integrity of the country, was\nobliged to resort to an armed response to put an end to the\ninvasion. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo appealed to its allies to\ndeal with Ugandan-Rwandan aggression.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank member\ncountries of the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC), in particular, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe,\nwhich responded to our appeal. I would also like to pay\ntribute to the valiant Congolese people, who undertook to\ndefend their homeland when it was under attack. I am also\ngrateful to Belgium, which had the courage to publicly\ncondemn a country in the Great Lakes region that was\ninvolved in this act of aggression, and to Ms. Colette\nBraeckman, who had the courage to denounce the plot\nagainst my country, as well as Chad, Gabon and many\nother African countries that publicly demonstrated their\nsupport and denounced this aggression.\nThe Assembly will agree with me that no honourable\nnation can allow its sovereignty and territorial integrity to\nbe called into question. The Congolese people will never\naccept subjugation, oppression or the imposition of\nperverse values such as a cultural genocide, which is so\nblithely tolerated by certain States.\nThe International Criminal Court whose Statute was\nsigned recently in Rome should get down to work and\nimmediately prosecute those who seek the destruction of\nhuman beings but who cover up their actions by making\ninnocent people take the blame.\nThe failure of the various appeals for a ceasefire\ncannot be blamed on the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. It is rather the result of the obstinacy, bad faith\nand cynicism of Rwanda and Uganda during the\nnegotiations held in Victoria Falls and in Addis Ababa.\nSince the first summit, held at Victoria Falls last\nAugust, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has\nindicated that implementation of the ceasefire was\ncontingent on the immediate, unconditional withdrawal\nfrom our national territory of foreign troops not invited by\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. I believe that the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council are obligated properly to implement the\nrelevant provisions of the Charter, in particular those of\nChapter VII, which envision action by the world\nOrganization with respect to threats to the peace, breaches\nof the peace, and acts of aggression.\nDespite the situation in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, our Government continues to abide by the\ntimetable leading to the democratization of our political\nlife. In that connection, I wish to inform the Assembly\nthat on 22 September 1998 our head of State signed Law\n122, relating to the organization and exercise of power in\nmy country. The new law grants the Constitutional\nCommission prerogatives allocated to the Constituent\nAssembly, finalizing the draft constitution to be the\nsubject of a referendum that will be organized early in\n1999.\nI reassure the international community that my\ncountry has noble aspirations and to date has granted no\nmaterial or military support whatsoever to the former\nRwandese Armed Forces, to the Interahamwe extremists,\nor much less to the Front pour la d\u00e9fense de la\nd\u00e9mocratie, contrary to the campaign of slander and\nincitement waged by aggressors wishing to absolve\n26\n\n\nthemselves of the massacre of more than a thousand people\nin and around Kasika.\nI cannot conclude without speaking of the rebuilding\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular and\nof the need for socio-economic development in Africa in\ngeneral; the continent continues to face crises of all kinds\nand is trying in vain to meet the challenge of recovery. In\nthis context, the role of the United Nations should not be\nlimited to accompanying Africa in implementing measures\nthat have been or will be adopted. Through capacity-\nbuilding, the United Nations system must translate into\nfact the organic partnership between itself and the\nOrganization of African Unity.\nIn the case of my country, the war imposed upon it\nby its neighbours has destroyed what remained of its\neconomic fabric, which had long suffered from the\neconomic mismanagement of the former dictatorship. That\nis why I appeal urgently to the United Nations and more\nspecifically to the \u201cFriends of the Congo\u201d \u2014 which at the\nBrussels conference decided to provide the assistance\nneeded to rebuild the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\u2014 to contribute to the trust fund established for that\npurpose, with a view to helping in the economic recovery\nand the rebuilding of my country.\nI wish in conclusion to say that my country would\nappreciate enormously any action that the United Nations\nmight consider to prevail upon the Rwandese Republic to\nsign the non-aggression pact among the members of the\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa, and to establish democracy in Rwanda and\nUganda. For all my country\u2019s problems are repercussions\nof the policy of non-democratization in Rwanda and in\nUganda. The international community would thus be\nperforming a useful task."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines, I extend my warmest congratulations\nto Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. His acumen,\nscholarship and leadership skills are well known in our\nregion through his distinguished participation in various\nhigh-level hemispheric forums over the years.\nI also wish to express my delegation?s sincere\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko\nof the Ukraine, who presided over the work of the fifty-\nsecond session with great distinction.\nOur esteemed Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.\nKofi Annan, has continued to provide outstanding\nleadership in the discharge of his duties. My delegation\ncommends the Secretary-General for his reform initiatives\ndesigned to make the United Nations a more efficient\norganization, capable of responding to the many\nchallenges it faces, and for his untiring efforts in the\npursuit of world peace and security, long-lasting\nprosperity and international cooperation. Our own\nUniversity of the West Indies, acting on behalf of the\nregion, has honoured him appropriately for his work in\nthis regard.\nSince the signing of the Charter some 53 years ago,\nthe world can celebrate numerous progressive changes in\nwhich the United Nations has played a significant part.\nUnited Nations peacekeepers have been instrumental in\npreserving peace and stability in troubled areas of the\nglobe, and the Organization?s humanitarian missions have\nbeen effective in alleviating suffering among many people\nthroughout the world.\nAt the same time, there remains a massive gap\nbetween aspiration and accomplishment. Despite the\nunprecedented prosperity that technological advances and\nthe globalization of production and finance have brought\nto many countries, especially in the developed world, the\nmajority of mankind is yet under the yoke of persistent\npoverty.\nThe eradication of poverty remains a priority for\ndeveloping countries. The Government of Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines is committed to the uplifting of the lot\nof the poor and disadvantaged sections of our society. In\nthis regard, my Government?s specific policy and\n17\n\n\nprogramme objectives over the medium and long term are\ndesigned to promote sustained economic growth and\ndevelopment in ways that expand employment, raise\nincomes, improve living standards, increase productive\ncapacity and reduce poverty. We therefore call for the\ncreation of a supportive international environment. We also\ncall on the developed countries to fulfil the commitments\nundertaken for the provision of additional financial\nresources in combating world poverty, that social\nmalignancy which is seminal many of the other problems\nthat plague developing countries.\nIt would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity\nto thank the European Union for its unwavering support and\nmost recent decision on the banana regime for African,\nCaribbean and Pacific countries, within the framework of\nthe Lom\u00e9 Convention on economic cooperation, trade and\ndevelopment. The new arrangements are compatible with\nthe rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and will\nallow this important regional industry to achieve a\nsustainable level of growth. These new arrangements also\ncreate an appropriate environment for the survival of a\nrestructured and competitive banana industry. It is therefore\nquite alarming to learn that the United States of America\nand some of our hemispheric friends in Latin America are\nabout to challenge the new arrangements.\nSuch actions force us to revisit the Charters of\nregional and international organizations of which we are a\npart and question the efficaciousness of our membership.\nThese incomprehensible stratagems on the part of friendly\ncountries nurture a pervasive cynicism among our peoples,\nwho chastise Governments for cooperating with those who\nsay one thing and then act in a totally contrary manner that\nis injurious to our best interests.\nMy delegation is amazed by the blind and apathetic\nposition of the United States of America on the issue. We\nare told that no harm is meant to Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines and other Caribbean banana-producing\ncountries, while efforts are made to undermine our social\nstability, which is facilitated by the export of our bananas\nunder the provisions of the Lom\u00e9 Convention.\nHow can we convince our citizens of the need to\ncombat the production, use and trade in illicit drugs if our\nbanana industry is destroyed? Is it really possible that our\nfriends, especially the United States, want to see the\nproliferation of instability, insecurity and extreme poverty\nin a region which has made steady socio-economic\nprogress since the widespread social turbulence of the\n1930s?\nIn spite of the special difficulties faced by small\nisland developing countries like Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, we are meeting all our international\nobligations and have acceded to several bilateral and\nmultilateral programmes on the eradication of illicit drugs.\nWe have the will to fight this scourge in the international\ncommunity, but friendly nations should also understand\nour vulnerabilities.\nMy Government is scrupulously committed to the\ndefense and enhancement of the democratic process which\nhas emerged in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and\nother countries of the Caribbean Community since the\nmid-1940s with the attainment of universal adult suffrage.\nOur democracies are based on respect for human rights,\non recognition, in policy and practice, that the distribution\nof national resources is disparate and that all our people\naspire to a decent standard of living, on the creation of\neconomic and other opportunities for personal\ndevelopment and on the observance of free and fair\nelections under our Constitution.\nAfter the fourth consecutive election victory of 15\nJune 1998, the New Democratic Party (NDP) Government\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, under the pragmatic\nand visionary leadership of the Rt. Honourable Sir James\nF. Mitchell, reiterates its commitment to these principles,\nas we join with the international community in building\na better life for our people in the twenty-first century.\nMy delegation strongly condemns the recent acts of\nterrorism which occurred in Kenya, Tanzania, Northern\nIreland and Cape Town, South Africa. Violence should\nnever be the way to settle disputes. The deaths of so\nmany innocent people in such outrageous acts can never\nbe justified. My delegation therefore urges that all parties\ninvolved must review their policies, settle their disputes\npeacefully and use reason instead of the bomb. My\nGovernment fully supports the Good Friday Agreement\nbrokered by the United States in Northern Ireland. It\nprovides an acceptable framework for the resolution of\ndeep-seated, historic differences in that part of the world.\nMy delegation is very concerned about the illicit\ntransfer and proliferation of small arms and light weapons\nand their accumulation in many countries. These activities\nconstitute a real threat to national and regional security\nand can contribute to the destabilization of States. We\n18\n\n\nurge Member States to cooperate in taking steps to deal\neffectively with this increasing problem. My country was\npleased to sign the Inter-American Convention Against the\nIllicit Production and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition,\nExplosives and Other Related Materials, at the Organization\nof American States in November 1997. My Government\nwishes to express its appreciation for the adoption in 1996,\nby the Disarmament Commission, of guidelines in\nresolution 46/36 H of 6 December 1991. However, we feel\nthat there is need for greater urgency in advancing\ninitiatives to deal with this issue at a global level.\nThe end of the cold war rekindled aspirations for\nlasting peace and prosperity. The dismantling of the Berlin\nWall heightened expectations for a peace dividend.\nUnfortunately, the United Nations has to continue utilizing\nmost of its resources in managing or containing conflicts of\nvarying origins and intensity in many parts of the world.\nThe role of the United Nations in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security has become even more\nrelevant than before. The situations in Angola, Burundi, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes region,\nthe Western Sahara and the Middle East, among many\nothers countries, continue to occupy the attention of this\nOrganization.\nWe are dismayed that, in spite of the end of cold-war\nrivalry, the unfortunate people of Cyprus must continue to\naccommodate the division imposed on their country.\nAs we approach the new millennium, our world is still\nthreatened by the existence of nuclear weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction and the potential for their\nfurther proliferation. The time has come for all countries to\ncommit themselves to the goal of complete eradication of\nweapons of mass destruction. I call for universal support for\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction. The Convention is clear on the total ban\non anti-personnel mines, which have taken the lives of so\nmany innocent civilians, mostly women and children.\nIn the nation-States of the Caribbean Community, the\ndawn of a new millennium challenges us to assert our\nindependence and demonstrate our maturity by crafting\ncreative constitutional arrangements, suited to our particular\nhistorical, cultural and political evolution. We have come\nthus far with constitutions moulded for us by colonial\nmasters. In the era of independence, we have experienced\nthe shortcomings of these original instruments. Many of our\nsister countries have already embarked on this mission, and\nthe Government and people of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines are beginning the process of forging a new\nconstitution for the governance of the country in the\ntwenty-first century.\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the\nInternational Year for Human Rights, we call on Member\nStates to remember the rights of the 21 million people in\nTaiwan. The Republic of China on Taiwan, both\nprosperous and democratic, deserves to be readmitted as\na member of the United Nations, even as it pursues the\ngoal of reunification. It is necessary that the United\nNations provide the forum for discussion that will provide\nthe framework for the peaceful reunification of both sides\nof the Taiwan Strait.\nMy delegation congratulates the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO), for its recent success in obtaining\nadditional rights and privileges, such as the right to\nparticipate in the debate of the General Assembly and the\nright of reply. We hope that this new status will serve to\nenhance, rather than adversely affect, the peace talks\nbetween the PLO and Israel. Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines strongly supports the Middle East peace\nprocess and the negotiations which seek the full\nimplementation of the Oslo accords.\nWith the changing world environment, the\nOrganization has assumed new prominence, and there is\nrenewed hope and high expectations for, as well as new\nideas on, the functioning of the General Assembly and, in\nparticular, the reform of the Security Council. Let us not\nlose momentum in our common quest to give new life to\nthis Organization.\nWe repeat our call, made during the Assembly?s\nfifty-second session, for an increase in both the permanent\nand non-permanent membership of the Security Council.\nJapan and Germany deserve their seats as permanent\nmembers, but Latin American and the Caribbean, Africa\nand Asia must be given permanent seats, which should be\nrotated among aspiring countries in those regions.\nThere has been much debate on whether new\npermanent members should have the same rights as the\nold permanent members. There must be no discrimination,\nand no two classes of permanent members. As regards the\nveto currently held by permanent members, in the opinion\nof my delegation, it is time for its abolition. We must be\nguided by the key word, \u201cdemocracy\u201d, as we move to\nreform the United Nations.\n19\n\n\nAs a member of the Alliance of Small Island States,\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines fully supports initiatives\nto protect the environment. The effects of global warming\nare of grave concern to small islands like ours, whose\ncoastal areas may become submerged, and whose protective\ncoral reefs are at risk of total destruction. Meteorologists\ntell us that July 1998 was the hottest month since reliable\nrecords have been kept. We in the Caribbean can hardly\ndoubt this, given the exceptional heat wave and humidity\nwhich we have experienced this year. Our region also\ncontinues to be battered by more frequent and stronger\nhurricanes, as evidenced this year again.\nHurricane Georges has devastated several islands in\nthe Caribbean, leaving over 300 dead and hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in damage to infrastructure, homes and\nutilities in its wake. The Gulf coast of the United States\nmainland has also suffered from the effects of that\nhurricane, providing us with a stark reminder that the forces\nof nature respect no borders. I take this opportunity to\nextend condolences and solidarity to all those who have lost\nrelatives and loved ones, and to the Governments of the\naffected countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, with\nits limited resources, has already embarked on a programme\nof assistance to our sister countries in the Caribbean, where\nwe know that each one of us is our brother?s keeper.\nThe ecologically vulnerable islands and low-lying\ncoastal States of the Caribbean are subject to all the acute\nconsequences of urbanization and resource exploitation. We\nare exposed to the danger of waste being dumped in our\nseas and a rise in sea level as well as other effects of\nclimate change. There must be a strong commitment to the\nreduction in greenhouse emissions. We must carry the\nmomentum to combat climate change well into the twenty-\nfirst century in order to reduce the danger posed to our\nStates.\nThe issue of the sustainable development of small\nisland developing States involves much more than beaches\nand coral reefs. It is about the existence of effective\npartnerships between peoples and Governments, and\nbetween developed and developing countries.\nIt is against this backdrop that we look forward to the\nspecial session to review the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, which is scheduled for 1999. We expect the review\nto result in concrete and practical outcomes, and to foster\nthe requisite political commitment to the process.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small but\nbeautiful plural country, striving to maintain its\nagricultural, tourism and other service industries in this\nera of globalization. We, like so many developing\ncountries today, suffer from the problems related to\nunemployment. We will continue to identify new and\nnon-traditional areas, such as informatics and financial\nservices, in order to create opportunities for our people,\nparticularly our youth.\nWe must express concern about Draconian\nimmigration laws and regulations being adopted by an\nincreasing number of countries. As a region where\nemigration has been of historic importance, the Caribbean\ncould be severely affected by these restrictions. These\nstringent immigration policies have led to massive and\nsummary deportations of immigrants from our region and\nother developing countries. Some people face\ndehumanizing abuse and death as they try to escape from\npoverty by seeking refuge in more developed countries.\nI need not emphasize how serious a threat these actions\npose to the social and economic well-being of the peoples\nof the Caribbean region.\nThe United Nations stands at the threshold of a new\nmillennium. We pray that it continues to perform its\nrightful role in addressing the many issues that occupy us\nin our everyday lives. We believe that the reforms that we\nall desire will build on progress already made in areas of\ninternational cooperation.\nLet us work together and give meaning to our\nCharter, to save succeeding generations from the scourges\nof war, poverty and hunger. Let us reaffirm our faith in\nfundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the\nhuman person and particularly the equal rights of man\nand woman, and of nations large and small.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset I would\nlike to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tribute\nto his own admirable diplomatic skills and also a vote of\nconfidence in his country, Uruguay. My delegation\nintends to cooperate fully with him as he guides the work\nof this Assembly.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our\nsincere appreciation to his predecessor, our friend\nHennadiy Udovenko, of the Republic of Ukraine, for the\nable and exemplary manner in which he presided over the\nwork of the fifty-second session.\nIn the same vein, we would like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose style of work\nand vigorous response to the various crises that have\nbeset the international community we deeply appreciate.\nWe want to reiterate our confidence in his work and\ncontinued support for his leadership.\nFollowing the United Nations fiftieth anniversary\ncelebrations, we, the Member States, reaffirmed our\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\nOrganization as enshrined in the Charter and further took\non the responsibility of charting an institutional\n9\n\n\nframework and operational parameters that would enhance\nthe Organization\u00e2s relevance and effectiveness in the\ntwenty-first century. The reform proposals made by the\nSecretary-General in 1997 attempted to articulate a vision\nof the future for a United Nations Organization that is more\nfocused and coherent and one that better reflects the new\ngeopolitical realities of the post-cold-war era.\nWe are encouraged that the first phase of the reform\nof the United Nations system was launched when the\nSecretary-General began to implement those measures that\nfall within his sphere of competence as chief administrative\nofficer of our Organization. My Government has taken full\ncognizance of those measures, as well as of proposals for\nreform, and is carefully considering them in detail.\nThe proposal to convene a Millennium Assembly to\narticulate a vision for the United Nations in the new century\nhas our full support. All Member States must actively\nparticipate in the preparations for and holding of the\nMillennium Assembly in order to come up with a\nconsensus document to guide the Organization into the next\ncentury. However, we believe that the proposed sunset\nprovisions, which are to effect cut-off mechanisms for some\nissues on the United Nations agenda, need to be carefully\nconsidered. My Government will lend its support to any\ndevelopment dividend that channels savings generated by\nadministrative efficiency into a Development Account,\nespecially if it benefits developing countries. We must\ncontinue to search for a general agreement on the proper\nand efficient utilization of the Development Account.\nWhen the reform process was first initiated, my\nGovernment alluded to the need for us, the Member States,\nto formulate a mechanism to deal with the financial crisis,\nwhich, much to our chagrin, continues to worsen. I reiterate\nonce again that it is we, the Member States, who have to\npay our dues promptly, in full and unconditionally or risk\nbeing an ineffective Organization that is incapable of\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nStill on the process of reform, my Government is\ndisappointed by the excruciatingly slow progress being\nmade in the Open-ended Working Group on the Question\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\nRelated to the Security Council. The key issue of the\nexpansion still preoccupies the Working Group and a\nsolution continues to elude that Group. Africa, for its part,\nremains steadfast in its just demand for two permanent\nseats \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to be shared on a rotational basis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as for\nthree non-permanent seats. The system of rotation is an\ninnovation that Africa is proposing in the name of\ndemocracy and sovereign equality of Member States. It\nmay not suit other regions, and we have stated that we\nare preparing it for the Africa region alone. I take this\nopportunity once more to urge our friends outside the\nAfrica region to support our just demand, as it is intended\nto enhance the representative nature and authority of the\nSecurity Council.\nIt has also become apparent that the impasse in the\ndeliberations of the Working Group is a result of the\nnonacceptance by a handful of powerful countries of the\nsacrosanct principles of equitable representation,\ndemocracy and transparency. We hold that the\ndemocratization of the United Nations system is integral\nto its continued legitimacy and efficacy. Conversely, the\nincreasing inefficiencies and lack of efficacy that we\nwitness today on the part of the Security Council are in\nlarge measure the consequence of its lack of moral\nauthority, itself the result of the unrepresentative and\nundemocratic nature of the Council as it is presently\nconstituted.\nIn the name of human rights, pressure has been\nbrought to bear especially on developing countries to\ndemocratize their national political systems and to become\nmore transparent, and most of them have done so. We\ntherefore insist that the same processes of democratization\nand transparency should characterize international\nrelations, particularly the reform of the United Nations\nsystem.\nLet me recall that the Movement of Non-Aligned\nCountries has on several occasions spoken against the\nanachronistic and undemocratic nature of the power of the\nveto. The Movement has proposed the restriction of the\nscope of the veto to matters pertaining to Chapter VII of\nthe Charter, with a view to its eventual abolition. But\nwhile the veto exists we insist that all new permanent\nmembers should, in accordance with the principle of\nsovereign equality of Member States, equally wield the\npower of the veto.\nAfrica has witnessed a dramatic broadening of\nrelative peace and stability with the return of democracy\nto Liberia and Sierra Leone. The return of the legitimate\nGovernment of Sierra Leone is of particular significance\nto the African continent, as it came about as a result of\nresolute action by the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States to reverse the military coup in that country.\nThis was in conformity with an Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) watershed resolution taken at the Harare\n10\n\n\nsummit in 1997 in response to the coup in Sierra Leone to\nthe effect that henceforth Africa will not accept the change\nof a legitimate Government on the continent by military\nmeans.\nAnother example of the positive political developments\nin Africa has been the various steps taken by the present\nGovernment of Nigeria to return that key country to\ndemocratic governance. It is only fair that those who have\nbeen critical of events in that country in the past should\nnow openly welcome the recent positive developments.\nBut the situation in Africa has not been without its\ndisappointments. The deteriorating situation in Angola\ndeserves our urgent attention. The achievement of peace\nand stability in that country continues to be obstructed by\nUNITA\u00e2s constant and deliberate non-compliance with the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol or with relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council. We\nurge the UNITA leadership to heed to the voice of reason\nand give peace a chance in Angola. We equally urge those\nmembers of the international community who have\ninfluence on the UNITA leader to persuade him. In the\nmeantime, we ask the international community to join\nAngola and the countries of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) in their decision to work\nwith those positive elements in UNITA who have\ncommitted themselves to continue with the peace process in\nAngola.\nSovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of\nStates are age-old principles of international law, and\nrespect for them is the bedrock of inter-State relations.\nThese fundamental principles are at the core of the United\nNations Charter, to which we all subscribe. They are held\nequally sacrosanct in the Non-Aligned Movement, the OAU\nand many other international organizations. Therefore any\nviolation of these principles cannot and must not be taken\nlightly, as it poses a serious threat to international peace\nand security.\nSadly, in our subregion, the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo has recently fallen victim to such flagrant\nviolations of international law. In August this year, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo found itself under siege\nby rebels supported by foreign troops. Realizing that the\nfall of Kinshasa was imminent, the legitimate Government\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance\nwith Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, appealed for\nassistance from Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) member States to enable it to defend its\nsovereignty and territorial integrity.\nThe presence in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo of allied forces from the SADC States of Angola,\nNamibia and Zimbabwe is a response to this call and has\nthe objective of upholding the fundamental provisions of\nthe Charters of the United Nations and of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on the inviolability\nof the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence\nof member States. It is also in line with the OAU\nresolution approved at the Harare summit of 1997\ncondemning the change of legitimate Governments by\nmilitary means, as well as in compliance with a 1995\nresolution of the SADC Inter-State Defence and Security\nCommittee in which SADC member States agreed to take\ncollective action in cases of attempted coups to remove\nlegitimate Governments by military means in the\nsubregion. It is in conformity with that very decision\ntaken by SADC that, as I speak, troops from the Republic\nof South Africa and the Republic of Botswana, two\nSADC countries, are involved in upholding the authority\nof the legal Government of Lesotho against army\nmutineers.\nMy country remains committed to the search for a\nnegotiated settlement to the crisis in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo in accordance with the relevant\nprovisions of the Charters of the United Nations, the\nOAU and of SADC. It will be recalled that since the\noutbreak of the conflict, Zimbabwe has hosted two\nsummits with a view to finding durable peace and\nstability in the Great Lakes region. The second Victoria\nFalls summit, held from 7 to 8 September 1998, called\nfor a ceasefire in the conflict in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo. Zimbabwe remains committed to this\nprocess. We appeal to the international community to\nsupport Africa\u00e2s various initiatives aimed at establishing\ndurable peace in the Great Lakes region.\nMy country is concerned about the situation in the\nHorn of Africa, where fraternal forces of the Federal\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and Eritrea are facing\neach other, ready to go to war. We appeal to these\nbrotherly countries to continue cooperating with the OAU\nin the search for a peaceful resolution to the border\nconflict. In Western Sahara, we urge the parties to\ncomplete the Houston accords peace process by holding\nthe proposed referendum.\nWe condemn the recent killings of innocent people\nin the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi\nand Dar-es-Salaam. We are disappointed by the stalemate\nin the Middle East peace process. We urge the\nGovernment of Israel to show flexibility in carrying\n11\n\n\nforward the peace process. The killing of Iranian diplomats\nin Afghanistan is regrettable and unacceptable in inter-State\nrelations. We urge the parties to the Lockerbie affair to\nseize the present opportunity to resolve this sad, long-\nstanding issue. We ask for good faith on all sides in order\nto carry the process forward.\nThe African continent continues to face a multitude of\nproblems as it settles into the new world order. African\ncountries are implementing painful political, social and\neconomic adjustments to existing structures in order to\nrespond to the twin processes of liberalization and\nglobalization. We have embarked on structural adjustment\nprogrammes, often at the behest of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions. These programmes have had a severely adverse\nimpact on the social welfare of the African countries. The\ncurtailment of expenditure on social programmes,\nparticularly health and educational facilities, in the absence\nof the requisite safety nets, has worsened the living\nconditions of the majority of the African peoples and in\nsome cases this has heightened instability and insecurity in\nour countries.\nFor many developing countries, the issue of resource\nflows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debt\nproblem. Figures continue to indicate that the overall debt\nof developing countries is still on the increase. We believe\nthat new, comprehensive and coordinated approaches to the\ndebt and debt-servicing problem have to be adopted,\nincluding outright forgiveness.\nThe critical economic situation in Africa, the least\ndeveloped and most marginalized of all regions, has to be\naddressed if global economic growth and interdependence\nare to have any meaning at all. Apart from the excruciating\nand debilitating debt, there is need for an increased flow of\nresources in the form of both official development\nassistance and foreign direct investment.\nI wish to conclude my remarks on economic matters\nby mentioning an issue that is of vital importance to the\nquestion of sustainable development: the World Solar\nProgramme 1996-2005, which was adopted by the World\nSolar Commission. The promotion and popularization of\nsolar energy technologies can be a major contribution to\nsolving the world\u00e2s energy crisis and ensuring the\navailability of a clean and inexhaustible source of energy\nfor sustainable development. I urge all Member States to\nsupport the draft resolution on the World Solar Programme,\nwhich will be presented at this session.\nIn the field of disarmament, the much vaunted peace\ndividend did not materialize at the end of the cold war.\nOn the contrary, it appears that an arms race is still with\nus, and it is my Government\u00e2s strong conviction that the\ninternational community must continue to work\npurposefully for nuclear disarmament, as well as for the\ntotal removal from the face of our planet of other\nweapons of mass destruction and for stricter control over\nthe production, sale and movement of small arms. My\ndelegation was deeply disappointed that the United\nNations Disarmament Commission this year concluded its\nsubstantive session without reaching an agreement on the\nneed for, or the agenda of, the fourth special session of\nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We owe\nit to posterity to lay the foundations of a third millennium\nfree from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nMy Government welcomes the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings,\nadopted at the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly, and the recently adopted Statute of the\nproposed International Criminal Court. The international\ncommunity has long witnessed how ill-equipped Member\nStates of the United Nations have been in dealing with\ninternational terrorism, and for us in Africa the recent\nterrorist bombings of the United States embassies in\nNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, which together claimed about\n260 lives, brought home to us the vulnerability of\ndeveloping countries to the sophistication of modern\nterrorism.\nThe Statute of the International Criminal Court has\nforged the missing link in the international legal order and\nis a genuine step forward in the field of human rights\nlaw. It has created new inter-State relationships and\ncomplementarity between national and international law.\nAs we come to the close of the Decade of International\nLaw, in 1999, we hope that the United Nations, especially\nthe Security Council, will also take decisions that will\nresult in the advancement of the primacy of the rule of\nlaw in international relations in the next century.\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to make a brief\ncomment on the contemporary realities of the\ninternational situation. Our balance sheet leaves much to\nbe desired. On the credit side, we have seen a modest\nmeasure of success. We have witnessed a return to\ndemocracy and peace in some countries where once there\nwas military despotism and armed conflict. We have\nsuccessfully paved the way for the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court and forged new partnerships\n12\n\n\nbetween our regional organizations and the United Nations.\nYet we still have a daunting debit side. Conflicts still rage\nin many parts of the world. Poverty, inequality and\nunderdevelopment still remain the order of the day for 90\nper cent of the world\u00e2s population. The AIDS pandemic\nthreatens to reverse the socio-economic gains made in most\nof our countries over the years. The ongoing financial crisis\nwhich engulfed South-East Asia and now threatens the\nentire world reminds us that current efforts at a new\narchitecture both for controlling the free flow of money and\nushering in a new discipline in the financial institutions\nshould be brought about without delay. We have to\nconfront and reduce world poverty with determination at a\ntime when some within the Organization itself are still\nresisting the democratic changes that are necessary for\nenhancing the image and authority of the Organization and\nmaking it effective in addressing these problems. Zimbabwe\nbelieves that the time for change is here and now and that\nMember States have a moral obligation to muster the\npolitical will to make those changes.\nLet the fifty-third session of the General Assembly be\none of qualitative and meaningful change for the people of\nthe world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "As previous speakers have done, I would like to\nconvey to the President my sincerest congratulations on\nhis election to the presidency at the fifty-third session of\nthe General Assembly. I am convinced that our Assembly\nwill benefit greatly from his sense of authority and\nleadership. I also wish to express my gratitude to his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his\ncommitment and perseverance in conducting our work\nduring the fifty-second session.\nThe Secretary-General of our Organization is\ndevoting tireless energy to opening up new avenues for\nour common efforts. He has emphasized the crucial\nimportance of good communications to ensure that the\nUnited Nations will be a catalyst both for those directly\ninvolved in international life and for our peoples. We\nshare that belief with him and encourage him in that\nrespect.\nLast Tuesday, members heard the statement of\nMr. Sch\u00fcssel, President of the Council of the European\nUnion. He spoke on behalf of all of the countries of the\nEuropean Union, and Luxembourg fully supports the\nviews expressed.\n19\n\n\nThe presence of representatives of 185 States in this\nHall reflects our common concern to ensure balance and\nsecurity among nations, but also within our societies. Our\nconcern is to ensure the permanence of values to which we\nare all committed in an ever-evolving world. In the context\nof its mandate to preserve international peace and security,\nour Organization regularly asks whether it has the means to\nensure that the general interest, as perceived by our\ncitizens, prevails. Surely, we must not be overly ambitious.\nWe are aware of the complexity and the magnitude of the\nsituations we face, and that these impose limits on our\naction. Therefore we must focus our operations and provide\nan appropriate framework for them. It is also our duty to\nacquire the means to act effectively whenever our\nineffectiveness or slow response would seem to negatively\naffect the weakest among us.\nLuxembourg supports the efforts under way to provide\nour Organization with permanent structures and to make\navailable to it forces prepared for rapid and effective\nintervention whenever the Security Council, guarantor of\nthe preservation of peace and security, deems it necessary.\nOur common efforts to make our world safer suffered\na serious setback following the nuclear tests recently carried\nout by two major countries in South Asia. We noted with\nsatisfaction that the representatives of India and Pakistan\nhave just announced from this rostrum that their countries\nare prepared to join the international community by\nacceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWe invite them to proceed in that direction as quickly as\npossible.\nWill these efforts appear absurd, given the endless\npursuit of the tragic discussion about the disarmament of\nIraq? This spring the Security Council endorsed the\nmemorandum of understanding submitted to it following the\nSecretary-General?s visit to Baghdad. Since then, such\ncooperation has been called into question. Such abrupt\nchanges generate concern and discouragement and call into\nquestion the credibility of our Organization. It is the\nSecurity Council?s responsibility to take the necessary steps\nto ensure that its decisions in this area are fully respected.\nOur Organization is pursuing conflict prevention and\npeacekeeping. At the recent meeting between the United\nNations and the representatives of regional organizations,\nthe proposal for development of a culture of prevention was\nput forward. Progress has been made in the concept of\nmutually supportive institutions and on support for the\ninitiatives taken at the regional and subregional level.\nWhile it is desirable to support such initiatives and\nefforts, we must remember that the Charter confers\nprinciple responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security on the Security Council\nand that the Council must fully play its role. We welcome\nthe fact that in 1998 the Council once again authorized\ntwo peacekeeping operations, one in Sierra Leone and the\nother in the Central African Republic.\nThe Ottowa conference on the prohibition of anti-\npersonnel mines was undeniably an invigorating success\nin an area which constantly creates innocent victims. This\ntreaty, which has just entered into force, will make it\npossible to save many human lives. The news that anti-\npersonnel mines are again being sown in Angola and\nalong the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nis terrifying. Such action, if confirmed, must be\ncondemned vigorously.\nIn Kosovo, the violence directed against the civilian\npopulation must end. It proves that the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia continues to follow paths which cannot but\ncompromise progress in its integration into international\nand European structures. Armed action conducted by\nAlbanian groups in Kosovo must also end. The scorn for\nhuman suffering displayed by the Serbian leaders and the\nextremists in Kosovo is incomprehensible.\nA new status for Kosovo must emerge. It is\ninconceivable that such a status can emerge under the\nsway of threat or, even worse, cold-hearted implacable\nviolence, which would merely drive the wedge deeper to\nthe point where the very idea of understanding would be\nabsurd. As Security Council resolution 1199 (1998)\nrequires, a political solution must be negotiated between\nthe parties under the aegis of the international community.\nFirm cohesion between Europe, the United States and the\nRussian Federation should enable those in the region, as\nwas the case previously, to address their future in a more\nrational and orderly way.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the extremist tendencies\nare on the decline. This political progress was rapidly\nreflected in concrete results achieved in the field, and\ntoday this war-torn country is engaged in reconstruction.\nIt is comforting to note that a growing number of\nindividuals charged with war crimes have been sent to the\nTribunal at The Hague. The establishment and the\n20\n\n\nfunctioning of the structures decided on in the context of\nthe peace process are today becoming a reality.\nThe recent elections have confirmed this new realism.\nIt is up to the international community to consolidate this\ntrend, as it still appears to be fragile, and to ensure, in\nparticular, the return of refugees and displaced persons.\nThis latter question is particularly acute in Croatia and\nAlbania.\nAnother key element for opening the way to a brighter\nfuture is a firm, unequivocal commitment by the regional\nparties and the international community. I refer to the peace\nprocess in the Middle East. Five years after the Oslo\nagreements, we must note the stagnation of the peace\nprocess, whose logic \u2014 the principle of land for peace \u2014\nthe current Israeli Government never really accepted.\nThe archaic and paralysing philosophy of refusal has\nunfortunately returned to the foreground; it is reflected in\nmany initiatives which only increase tension, thus nullifying\nthe efforts of those who advocate peace. The political\nleaders involved must reverse this trend so as to return to\nthe good faith implementation of all the provisions of the\nOslo agreements.\nOur action, in that region and in others, must focus on\nconvincing the parties involved that there is no alternative\nto peace.\nIt is regrettable that this central concept is also being\ncalled into question in a number of African regions. Tribal\nrivalries and resentments continue to supplant\nclearsightedness and the desire for good governance. In no\ncase should the political leaders involved in the different\nflashpoints feel that their only choice is between submitting\nto events and shirking their responsibilities.\nThe struggles for influence and the war in and around\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo are on the verge of\ndegenerating into a regional conflict and bringing about a\nhumanitarian catastrophe there too.\nThe causes of conflicts and the promotion of peace\nand sustainable development in Africa call for a united\nresponse. The debate at ministerial level that the Security\nCouncil has just held on these topics was very helpful. The\nGeneral Assembly will have occasion to consider this\nquestion over the course of its fifty-third session, with a\nview to a discussion on possible measures. While the future\nof Africa depends first of all on the efforts of Africans\nthemselves, the international community must be actively\ninvolved in order to ensure respect for international law,\nand in order to carry out its duty of solidarity.\nRecent events, with the terrible bombings perpetrated\nin Africa and Northern Ireland, remind us once again of\nthe intolerable nature of terrorism. It is up to the\ninternational community to acquire an effective means of\ncombating this scourge on an international level, and to\nensure that the perpetrators of such acts answer for their\ncrimes before the competent courts. We owe it to\nourselves to put a definitive end to the culture of\nimpunity in connection with terrorism.\nAnother priority for our General Assembly is reform\nof the Organization. We welcome the fact that some\nprogress was made during the fifty-second session. But\nreform cannot be an isolated event; it must become a\nprocess that underlies all of our action. We pledge to\ncontinue actively supporting the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, and to add our efforts to his, with a view to\ngiving the United Nations the capacity to respond in a\nflexible and evolving way to the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century.\nAny in-depth reform of the system will remain\nfragile so long as the Organization lacks sound and\nreliable financial resources. The grave financial crisis\nwhich the Organization has experienced for a number of\nyears must be considered as a threat to the effectiveness\nof the whole. Our proposed reforms will be consolidated\nonly when all Member States have agreed fully to meet\ntheir obligations under the Charter by paying their arrears\nto the United Nations, and by paying on time and\nunconditionally the full amount of their obligatory\ncontributions, both to the Organization?s regular budget\nand to the peacekeeping budget.\nThe maintenance of security and peace in the world\ncannot be dissociated from the international community?s\nefforts on behalf of development.\nWhen we see entire regions, even subcontinents,\nexperiencing poverty and malnutrition, there is a shocking\nimbalance which will soon pose a threat to the security of\nthe States concerned and to respect for the fundamental\nrights of the human individual.\nWhen we see that generations of young people can\nhope for no future but unemployment or a frustrating\ninactivity, there exists a flagrant and unjust imbalance\nwhich will be a source of conflict.\n21\n\n\nWhen we see social categories permanently deprived\nof education and health care, that, too, is an imbalance to\nwhich we cannot be indifferent.\nThe economic, financial and social crisis currently\nbesetting South-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has\nexacerbated this trend. Rationally, the international\ncommunity must acknowledge that the means of\nintervention traditionally, and almost mechanically,\nemployed to overcome economic crises have proved\nineffective this time.\nIn his work Civilisation mat\u00e9rielle, \u00e9conomie et\ncapitalisme, Fernand Braudel pointed out the profound\nsource of this crisis:\n\u201cthe emergence of a savage capitalism, as distinct\nfrom what we consider to be a market economy\u201d.\nA market economy, and particularly a social market\neconomy, cannot do without a stable State capable of\nregulating competition and protecting the weak.\nThe strengthening or restoration of a democratic,\nworking State in the countries in crisis seems to me to be\nan absolute priority.\nThe international community cannot shirk the\nobligation to shoulder its responsibilities and lend a strong\nhand. It will do this not only because of its duty of\nsolidarity, but because the interests of one and all are\nlinked.\nAnother area in which the interdependence of our\nobjectives is particularly visible and tangible is that of the\nmanagement of the world?s natural resources. It is clear that\nwe need to be ambitious when it comes to the long-term\nmanagement of our environment.\nLast year we met here in special session to undertake\nan initial evaluation of the implementation of the\ncommitments undertaken at the Conference on Environment\nand Development a little over six years ago. At Rio de\nJaneiro and during last year?s evaluation session we defined\nthe concept of a world partnership for sustainable\ndevelopment, a partnership respecting the fact that the\nprotection of the environment cannot be dissociated from\nthe economic and social development process.\nUndeniable progress has been made in recent years:\nthe entry into force of the Framework Convention on\nClimate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity\nand the Convention to Combat Desertification. But it must\nbe acknowledged that the world environment has\ncontinued to deteriorate.\nAccordingly, it is essential to accelerate the\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the programme of action\nadopted in Rio de Janeiro.\nLuxembourg intends to shoulder its share of this\nresponsibility. Accordingly, we have undertaken, in the\ncontext of the commitments made by the European Union\nat the Kyoto Conference, to reduce our emissions of six\ngreenhouse gases to 28 per cent below 1990 levels by the\nyear 2012.\nIn the context of the Biodiversity Convention, we\nalso plan to establish a national network of protected\nareas covering 10 per cent of our national territory.\nThe goal of managing the world?s material resources\nas a good parent would reflect an atavistic concern, that\nof guaranteeing security through careful preparation for\nthe future, in particular through suitable education.\nThe recent Lisbon Conference devoted to the\nproblems faced by young people rightly emphasized the\nneed to provide training that is suited to the job market so\nas to prevent unemployment and marginalization. Such\ntraining must include education about responsibility. We\ntherefore welcome the fact that the Lisbon Declaration\ncommits Governments to ensuring the participation of\nyoung people in programmes that concern them. In that\nway we can come closer to democratic civic education\nbased on the rights and responsibilities of citizens and on\nthe participation of young people in civil society.\nLuxembourg has undertaken a long-term effort to\nmake its own contribution to providing funds for\ndevelopment. Our efforts are aimed at attaining the target\nset by the United Nations of 0.7 per cent of gross national\nproduct for official development assistance before the end\nof the millennium. Our efforts occupy an important place\nin the struggle against poverty, which is one of the main\nobstacles to development. At present our contribution is\n0.56 per cent of gross national product and is equivalent\nto official development assistance of $195 per capita.\nAccording to those criteria, Luxembourg is fifth among\ndonor countries in the Development Assistance\nCommittee.\nFifty years ago our Organization adopted the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. For the first\n22\n\n\ntime, a universal organization declared its determination to\nplace respect for human rights at the heart of international\nrelations. Since then, we have made considerable progress\ntowards ensuring recognition for the universal value of such\nrights and their effective enjoyment.\nSeveral international instruments have been added to\nthe Universal Declaration so as to focus more precisely on\nwhat human rights represent and to ensure that the citizens\nof all countries of the world effectively enjoy these rights.\nOur Organization has established the post of High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and concern for human\nrights now underlies all of its activities. This progress leads\nus to believe that human rights will find the central and\npermanent home at the heart of international life that they\ndeserve.\nWe also note that the Criminal Tribunals established\nby the United Nations to bring to trial those accused of\ncrimes committed during recent wars in the former\nYugoslavia and Rwanda have recently been able to\nstrengthen their authority and the scope of their action. This\naffirmation of their importance played a considerable role\nin the preparation of the Statute of the International\nCriminal Court. I sincerely welcome the positive conclusion\nof the work of the recent Rome Conference. At the same\ntime, I should like to emphasize the fact that the entire\ninternational community has given that new institution\nstrong and constant support.\nThe end of the culture of impunity represents a\ndecisive turning point in international relations at the end of\nthis century. But this turning point will be convincing only\nif the Members of our Organization display a commitment\nto provide the new Court with the necessary credibility.\nIn this commemorative year, we must ensure that our\nachievements are assessed in depth and that we avoid\ncomplacency in the field of human rights. Only in this way\nwill it be possible to expand the base on which we can\nbuild the values that the international community has so\noften said it is prepared to ensure for humankind as a\nwhole.\nI am confident that the United Nations will remain\ncapable of steadfastly pursuing the attainment of the great\nobjectives it has set itself: to serve men and women, ensure\nrespect for their rights, preserve them from the scourge of\nwar and lead them towards development and fulfilment.\nLuxembourg?s support will certainly not be lacking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me start by\ncongratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.\nIn the same breath, I thank his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the able manner in\nwhich he conducted the work of the fifty-second session. I\nalso wish to express my delegation?s sincere appreciation to\nour brother, the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his wise leadership of the United Nations and\nfor his exceptional report on the work of the Organization.\nWe are gathered here once again to review the\ninternational situation. The fifty-second session of the\nAssembly had before it the document submitted by the\nSecretary-General entitled \u201cRenewing the United Nations:\na programme for reform\u201d. The debate on that item was as\nserious as it was animated. It became clear that the United\nNations in its present form is unable to respond to the\nrealities of the present world order, much less to the\nexigencies of the new millennium. For the United Nations\nto do so, it must reinvent itself, and become more\ndemocratic, efficient and, of course, financially stable. This\nwould befit an Organization created to serve the demanding\nneeds of humankind through its impact on economic and\nsocial development, especially in the developing countries.\nZambia would like to reiterate that the development\nmandate of the United Nations must be given priority and\nprominence in the reform process.\nFurthermore, after the issue of reform was debated last\nyear, it was made clear that the critical financial situation\nof the United Nations was itself a major stumbling block to\nthe Organization?s efforts not only to reform itself, but to\naddress the priorities it has set itself to accomplish. We\ntherefore reiterate our call for arrears owed to the United\nNations to be paid in full, on time and without\npreconditions.\nThe reform of the Security Council is without doubt\nthe core issue which must be addressed, with a view to\nmaking the Council more democratic. Essentially, the\nCouncil must be enlarged to enhance its credibility and at\nthe same time to reflect the universal character of the\nUnited Nations; this would remove the imbalances that\ncharacterize the present composition of the Council. To\nthis end, the Zambian delegation wishes to reiterate the\ncall made at the twelfth Summit of the Countries of the\nNon-Aligned Movement, held in Durban, in neighbouring\nSouth Africa, that expansion of the Security Council\nshould be by no less than 11 new seats, based on the\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution and, of\ncourse, bearing in mind the sovereign equality of Member\nStates.\nZambia further reiterates its support for the demand\nthat the regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America and\nthe Caribbean should now have permanent seats on an\nexpanded Security Council.\nWith specific regard to Africa, my delegation wishes\nto reaffirm the decision taken at the summit of heads of\nState of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in\nHarare in 1997 that five seats, of which two permanent,\nshould be allocated to the African continent and that, in\na 26-member Security Council, the African seats should\nbe rotated in accordance with the agreed criteria of the\nAfrican Group. My delegation further wishes to reiterate\nthe common view that the veto power in the Security\nCouncil is a mere anachronism. It must be restricted and\nultimately eliminated.\nIn the field of international peace and security, the\nneed for disarmament in all its aspects is as urgent as\never. To be sure, the lure of nuclear-weapons possession\nhas become even stronger and the use of conventional\nweapons, particularly small arms, is prevalent in the\nworld today.\nTo put an end to nuclear-weapons proliferation, the\nnuclear-weapon States have a major responsibility to lead\nthe international community towards nuclear disarmament,\nparticularly in the Conference on Disarmament. The\nConference must establish an ad hoc committee to begin\nnegotiations on a phased programme for the complete\nelimination of nuclear weapons within a specified time-\n27\n\n\nframe. The nuclear-weapon States should also lead the\ninternational community in sustained efforts to conclude a\nnuclear weapons convention.\nFurthermore, Zambia believes that the time is now\noverdue for the convening of the fourth special session of\nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which\nwould offer an opportunity for a thorough review and\nassessment of the implementation of the provisions of the\nFinal Document of the first special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament, held in 1978.\nAllow me at this juncture to turn to the situation in\nour region, with specific reference to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola and, of course, Lesotho.\nWith regard to the situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, I want to confirm that Zambia,\nthrough its President, Mr. Frederick Chiluba, has been\nactively involved in the search by all regional leaders for a\nlasting and peaceful solution. The leaders of the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), under the able\nleadership of President Mandela of South Africa and other\nregional leaders, have done a commendable job in this\nregard \u2014 of course, under very difficult circumstances.\nAs we are all well aware, the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security is the primary responsibility\nof no other body than this Organization and its Security\nCouncil. There is no doubt, therefore, that the situation in\nthe neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, if\nunresolved, could pose a threat not only to the region, but\nalso to international peace and security. The mediation\nefforts of SADC and other regional leaders therefore\ndeserve the support of the international community in order\nto forestall the threat to international peace and security\nwhich the crisis poses.\nThe situation in Angola has continued to worsen,\ndespite the patience and efforts of the international\ncommunity to bring Africa?s oldest civil war to an end.\nZambia, as a neighbouring country and as host to the peace\ntalks which finally resulted in the signing of the Lusaka\nProtocol in November 1994, is extremely concerned about\nthe regression in the Angolan peace process. While the\nanger and disappointment of the international community\nare understandable and justified, it would not be advisable\nfor us, at this moment, to abandon the peace process in\nAngola. We have come this far after long and painstaking\nefforts and invested a great amount of resources in the\nAngolan peace process. We cannot afford now to abandon\nthe Angolan people, who have suffered so much and whose\nhopes were pinned on the Lusaka Protocol. We hope,\ntherefore, that in spite of the setbacks, the international\ncommunity, through this body, will reassert its authority\nand use its immense wisdom to put the Angolan peace\nprocess back on track.\nZambia wishes to recognize the very noble and\nprofessional efforts of our brother, the late Alioune\nBlondin Beye, in this process. He died without seeing his\nefforts result in peace and stability in Angola. May his\nsoul rest in peace. It is important, however, to ensure that\nhis efforts were not in vain by working harder ultimately\nto bring durable peace to Angola.\nMy country is also concerned about recent\ndevelopments in Lesotho. As a member of SADC,\nZambia is fully in support of the role which that\norganization is playing in trying to bring about a peaceful\nsettlement. In this regard, we wish to appeal to the\ninternational community to give necessary support to the\nSADC efforts, spearheaded by Botswana, Mozambique,\nSouth Africa and Zimbabwe.\nIt is now common knowledge that Africa as a whole\nhas begun to make significant economic and political\nprogress in recent years. However, in many parts of the\ncontinent, progress remains threatened or, indeed,\nimpeded by conflict. United Nations records show that,\nsince 1970, more than 30 wars have been fought in Africa\nalone, the vast majority of them intra-State in origin.\nIn this regard, my delegation wishes once again to\ncongratulate our brother, Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nfor his excellent report to the Security Council last April\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\npeace and sustainable development in Africa, which is\nessentially a blueprint for resolving Africa?s numerous\nand complex woes by charting a course for peace and\ndevelopment.\nIn the area of peacekeeping, Africa has already put\nin place the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution to resolve its own conflicts\non the continent. We salute the efforts of Mr. Salim\nAhmed Salim, Secretary-General of the OAU, in this\ndirection. We urge the international community and the\nGeneral Assembly to support the Mechanism in order for\nit to function effectively and to the benefit of Africa.\nThe spectre of international terrorism has assumed a\ndangerous momentum of its own. It does not discriminate\nbetween combatants and non-combatants. The brunt of it\n28\n\n\nall is in fact borne more by innocent bystanders. The acts\nof terrorism that rocked our sister republics of Kenya,\nTanzania and South Africa, and the subsequent retaliatory\naction on Sudan and Afghanistan, have struck a cord in all\nof us, without exception. At issue is the unnecessary loss of\nhuman life. To protect human life, the international\ncommunity should seriously address itself to the root causes\nof terrorism. The hour has now come for the full\nimplementation of the General Assembly Declaration on\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained in\nresolution 49/60, and the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings adopted at the fifty-\nsecond session. This Assembly must waste no time in its\nurgent conclusion and effective implementation of a\ncomprehensive international convention on combating\nterrorism.\nWe are happy to note that the United Nations\nDiplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, which\nwas held in Rome, Italy, this year, adopted the Court?s\nStatute. This is a powerful instrument of justice that the\ninternational community has given to itself and generations\nto come. My delegation is pleased that the crime of\naggression falls within the jurisdiction of the Court,\nalthough the Court shall only have jurisdiction over the\ncrime once a definition and the conditions under which the\nCourt shall do its work are agreed upon. In this regard, we\nlook forward to a quick resolution of this matter, since\nresolution 3314 (XXIX) contains most of the elements for\ndefinition of the crime of aggression.\nConsidering what the world has witnessed in our sister\nrepublic of Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia, we\nwelcome the inclusion, under war crimes, of cases of armed\nconflict not of an international character.\nLet me now, on behalf of my delegation, turn to the\nworld economy, which is becoming more integrated.\nGlobalization and liberalization are indeed the current\neconomic wave, and will continue in years to come. They\nhave, however, far-reaching implications, in particular for\nthe developing countries, as reflected in the current\ninternational financial confusion or turmoil. The United\nNations faces the great challenge of coming up with\ninitiatives to manage globalization and liberalization in such\na manner that they benefit the entire community of nations,\nwithout exception. Processes of globalization and\nliberalization that undermine development are not in the\ninterests of the international community.\nThe external debt problem is yet another issue that\nimpacts negatively on the economic and social\ndevelopment of many developing countries, Zambia\nincluded. We can recall a number of initiatives put in\nplace to resolve this particular problem, but so far none\nseem to be effective, including the present Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, which\nnot only has targeted too few developing countries but\nalso has a long transition period before eligibility is\ngranted.\nIt would, however, be a grave oversight to fail to\nacknowledge the commendable efforts of our brother, the\nSecretary-General, in this area. Zambia welcomes the\nuniform and strong endorsement by the Development\nAssistance Committee of the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development of the Secretary-General?s\nproposals to liberalize and assess the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative and convert all remaining\nofficial debt owed by the poorest African countries,\nZambia included, into grants. We also welcome his other\nproposals which received similar endorsement by the\nDevelopment Assistance Committee.\nAdverse weather patterns continue to bring into\nsharp focus how fragile the global environment is. The\nrecent destruction of life and property by Hurricane\nGeorges in some countries of the Caribbean and four\nStates in the United States of America adds to the ravages\nof flooding in China and Bangladesh this year. This\nAssembly will recall that a year earlier Europe faced\nsimilar flooding, while certain parts of Eastern and\nSouthern Africa faced a combination of flooding and\ndrought. All these are reminders to the international\ncommunity to meet the challenges caused by climate\nchange and other adverse environmental factors and we\nreiterate our call to the international community to\npromote environmental sustainability with renewed\ncommitment.\nTransnational deflationary forces are threatening\nglobal economic stability. In this uncertain outlook, the\nfortunes of many countries are under constant threat. For\nAfrica, which is just emerging from the lost decade of the\n1980s, the emerging global economic turmoil will add\nnew strains to the process of promoting economic growth\nand development. Indeed, it is already clear that concern\nabout the emerging global economic turmoil neglects the\nchallenges facing Africa, as if to reaffirm its\nmarginalization in the world economy.\n29\n\n\nIn a spirit of interdependence, we in Africa call upon\nthe international community not to overlook and forget the\nchallenges of Africa. Africa needs a conducive international\nenvironment that will contribute to resolving the continent?s\nexternal debt crisis, growing poverty, slow export growth\nand other impediments to its development.\nIn this regard, we are pleased to note that Japan will\nsoon be convening the Second Tokyo International\nConference on African Development. We salute Japan. And\nwe hope this forum will offer an opportunity to relaunch\nthe dialogue on African development.\nZambia, like many other developing countries, has\nbeen implementing a very painful structural adjustment\nprogramme anchored on macroeconomic stabilization,\nprivatization and, of course, commercialization. The policies\nwe have undertaken have been critical to boosting and\nsustaining economic growth and development. Over the past\nfew years Zambia has undergone a remarkable\ntransformation. We have an open economy driven by the\nprivate sector. In the second generation of economic\nreforms that we are embarking upon our major focus is on\nthe reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by the year 2004.\nWe invite the international community to come and play a\nrole in our economic programme.\nLet me conclude by stating that Zambia believes that,\nas we stand on the threshold of the new millennium, we all\nhave a collective responsibility in this community of nations\nto chart a new course to strengthen our Organization. We\nneed a strong United Nations to meet the exacting demands\nof the future. By strengthening it, we all strengthen\nourselves. Zambia pledges to be a positive partner in this\nnoble endeavour.\nI thank the Assembly for listening to me. I thank those\nrepresentatives \u2014 most of those present \u2014 who nodded\ntheir heads in appreciation. I thank my brothers and sisters\nfrom the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) for being with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all,\npermit me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay, on his election to the post of\nPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like to\naddress words of gratitude to Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko\nfor the dynamic and competent manner in which he carried\nout his duties as President of the previous session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe have very attentively studied the report of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization and\nhave a very positive opinion of it. The quiet revolution\nbegun by the Secretary-General one year ago \u2014 the\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations \u2014 has become an\nirreversible process tied to the rapidly changing conditions\nof our new era. One of the major problems confronting the\ncommunity of nations is how to better understand emerging\nsocio-economic forces and the modalities of globalization,\nand how to channel them towards the fulfilment of our\nrequirements.\nActing within the framework of the United Nations,\nTurkmenistan is expanding the scope of its responsibilities\nwithin the world community of nations. I have the honour\nto inform the Assembly that yesterday, here at United\nNations Headquarters, Turkmenistan signed the Kyoto\nProtocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change. Furthermore, today, during my meeting\nwith the Secretary-General, I handed him the instrument\nof Turkmenistan?s accession to the Convention on the\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,\nsigned by the President of Turkmenistan. Although we\nknow that accession by several countries more is still\nlacking for the Convention?s entry into force,\nTurkmenistan by its example would like to call on other\nStates Members of the Organization to join the\nConvention, adding their voices in its support \u2014 or rather\nin support of their citizens working for the United\nNations.\nThe Secretary-General?s proposal concerning real\npartnerships between the United Nations and multilateral\nregional organizations seems to be highly relevant,\nbecause regional organizations are especially effective in\nearly warning and preventive diplomacy, as well as in\nfinding optimal ways to carry out globalization.\nThe proposal on the establishment of a special unit\nto combat crime, terrorism, drug and weapons trafficking\nand money-laundering is very timely. A recent wave of\nterrorist acts around the world, including the bombings in\nTanzania and Kenya and the killing of Iranian diplomats\nin Afghanistan, requires consolidation of efforts by the\nworld community and decisive action. Turkmenistan\nresolutely fights against those negative phenomena and is\nprepared to contribute to the implementation of special\nUnited Nations programmes aimed at eradicating these\nevils.\nTurkmenistan welcomes the strengthening of the\nframework mechanism for interaction among all\norganizations of the United Nations system. I would like\nto take this opportunity to express on behalf of the\nGovernment of Turkmenistan our gratitude to the\nmissions of the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF),\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other United Nations agencies,\nthe positive results of whose work in Turkmenistan\ncannot be overestimated. Turkmenistan also expresses its\ngratitude to the donor countries supporting those\nprogrammes in our country.\n28\n\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the continuing armed\nconflict in Afghanistan because it has a negative impact on\nthe stability of the region and on its economic development.\nIts impact also bears on Turkmenistan, which has one of\nthe longest borders with Afghanistan, stretching for nearly\n1,000 kilometres. Turkmenistan shares the opinion that\nthere is no alternative to a peaceful, negotiated settlement\nin that country and that violence gives birth to violence and\nwill only lead the process to a dead end. That is why we in\nTurkmenistan believe that the road to peace in that long-\nsuffering nation lies through political negotiations among all\nparties to the conflict under the auspices of the United\nNations. Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of the\nUnited Nations, its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and\nhis Special Envoy, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and joint steps\nundertaken within the framework of the 6 + 2 mechanism.\nTurkmenistan?s President, Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov,\nmaintains constant contacts regarding this matter with the\nSecretary-General and with the leaders of neighbouring\nStates. Turkmenistan will continue to cooperate closely with\nthe United Nations in this regard. Interaction among\nAfghanistan?s neighbouring countries, the United Nations,\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and all the\nparties concerned should lead to the termination of one of\nthe most protracted and violent conflicts of this century.\nIn view of the global changes that are taking place in\nthe sphere of international relations, Turkmenistan believes\nthat development of the Central Asian region objectively\ndeserves the attention of the world. The States of that\nregion have opened to the world a huge geopolitical and\ngeoeconomic potential, enormous natural wealth, and\ngeographical and transport opportunities. Turkmenistan is\nvigorously seeking alternative routes for delivery of its\nenergy resources to international markets. In developing a\nstrategy for the implementation of pipeline construction\nprojects, we have proceeded and continue to proceed on the\nbasis of various options. Pipeline infrastructure based on a\nvariety of options will ensure an increased volume and\ngreater diversification of energy deliveries, and will enable\nus to stabilize and guarantee their international distribution.\nThere is one more issue that I would like to dwell\nupon in this context. It concerns inter-State pipeline routes.\nThe problem of international pipeline routes can well be\ncompared to that of international sea straits, which was one\nof the most complex political and diplomatic challenges at\nthe turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today\nsuch straits ensure freedom of navigation, including for\nlandlocked States. Their international legal recognition is\ncalled for by the economic and political interests of the\nworld community in developing mutual relations. The\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\nadopted in 1982, reaffirmed the importance of\nmaintaining freedom of navigation through straits and\npassages in archipelago waters and the need to do so.\nFreedom of navigation, which existed in the past as an\ninternational custom, was legally codified as one of the\nmost important principles of international law.\nIn this context, of great interest are modern problems\nrelating to the transportation of energy resources to\ninternational markets. It so happens that these enormous\nresources are located far away from the world markets.\nUsually it is landlocked nations that possess such\nresources, and the choice of delivery routes and the\nlocation of transnational pipelines has turned into a major\nproblem of our times. The resolution of this problem lies\nat the centre of the geopolitical and geoeconomic interests\nof the States that own the resources, the transit States and\nthe consumer countries.\nIn this respect, Turkmenistan promotes the initiative\nof security guarantees and unimpeded transit of energy\nresources along international pipelines. This initiative has\nalready been discussed with a number of State leaders, as\nwell as with the United Nations Secretary-General. We\nadvocate the establishment of an international legal\nmechanism designed to protect the interests of the\nproducers, transit countries and the consumers. It is\nnecessary to fully preclude the possibility of pipelines\nbeing used as a means of political pressure and economic\ndomination. The process of globalization in international\neconomic relations calls for the elaboration of an\ninternational convention that will govern the regime of\ninter-State pipelines and guarantee their functioning.\nTurkmenistan regards this matter as one of the most\nimportant challenges of the coming twenty-first century\nand is prepared to sponsor a document on this matter in\nthe United Nations.\nA change in the geopolitical situation has brought\nabout a new correlation of interests in the Caspian Sea\nregion, thus making it necessary to elaborate new\napproaches for the determination of the status of the\nCaspian Sea. The uncertainty that exists today with\nrespect to this issue hampers rational use of the enormous\npotential of the Sea by the littoral States. A majority of\nthe Caspian Sea States today favour the option of dividing\nthe Caspian Sea into different sectors. Turkmenistan also\nsupports this approach, just as it had previously supported\nthe concept of condominium.\n29\n\n\nWhat is most important to us under either of the two\napproaches is that the interests of all littoral States should\nbe fully taken into consideration and that cooperation in the\nCaspian Sea region should be built on the basis of mutual\nrespect, equality and mutual benefit. The Caspian Sea\nshould be a sea of accord, and its wealth should be a\ncommon heritage of all littoral States, with each of them\nhaving a right to a corresponding national share of the sea.\nTurkmenistan believes that the search for a new legal status\nof the Caspian Sea, which would require all littoral States\nto look for reasonable compromises and display readiness\nto have an appropriate perception of new realities, should\nbe ensured by means of monitoring by the United Nations.\nToday the process of establishing a new international\nlegal status of the Caspian Sea confronts a number of\ndifficulties fraught with very negative consequences for\nregional stability. Under these conditions we consider that\nUnited Nations involvement would be highly appropriate.\nWe are happy to see that today there is a growing\ntendency towards restraint with respect to the attempts\naimed at associating extremism and other negative\nphenomena with the world of Islam. The Muslim world is\nmultifaceted and diverse. It faces a great range of universal\nand global problems of development. In this context, there\nemerges an objective need for mutual understanding and\ndialogue among various religious trends, a need for restraint\nand tolerance. The President of the United States, the\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Prime\nMinister of Turkey and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\nGermany and Russia have expressed very wise and\npolitically promising ideas and statements during the current\nsession. In this respect, we find of great interest the idea\nvoiced by the President of Iran, Mr. Khatami, on declaring\nthe year 2001 the year of dialogue between civilizations.\nThe point is that the resolution of today?s global challenges\nis inconceivable without a meaningful dialogue, an\nexchange of opinions and a search for ways to resolve the\nmost pressing problems.\nIt is already three years since Turkmenistan began\npursuing its policy as a State of permanent neutrality.\nTurkmenistan?s neutrality is not a shell that protects it from\ndangers and tribulations of the outside world. On the\ncontrary, it is a position of strength that allows us to\nactively influence the situation in our region and the world\nas a whole and to develop effective international\ncooperation. We seek to maintain equal and equitable\nrelations with all nations, and our national interests are\npursued through economic openness and political\nimpartiality. Proceeding from this position, Turkmenistan\nattaches great importance to the United Nations role as a\nunique international institution in which all countries of\nour planet have equal access to international debate and\nthe resolution of problems that concern them.\nTurkmenistan believes that on the eve of the twenty-\nfirst century the United Nations should acquire additional\npowers and responsibilities, and strengthen its current\nones, by becoming a major factor in establishing a\nclimate of mutual respect and trust both in separate\nregions and the world as a whole.\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall a proposal made\nby the Secretary-General regarding the holding of the\nGeneral Assembly session in the year 2000 in the form of\nthe Millennium Assembly. That Assembly would give all\nthe Member States of the United Nations a unique\nopportunity to take a look into the future, to ponder how\nthey perceive the United Nations of today and to\nspeculate on what kind of United Nations they will\nsupport in the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nthird session. I am convinced that under your guidance this\nsession will be crowned with success. I should also like to\nexpress my sincere gratitude to your predecessor, the\nrepresentative of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the\nskill with which he led this body during his term of office.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express our\ndeepest appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his efforts to promote the reform of the\nOrganization for the benefit of the entire international\ncommunity.\nI have the honour and the privilege of addressing the\nGeneral Assembly for the first time. From this lofty\nrostrum I should like to underline the importance the\nRepublic of Moldova attaches to the role of the United\nNations in the world.\nIn the new world structure, the United Nations is, for\nthe Republic of Moldova, as it is for other States, the body\nthat allows them to express their national identity and their\nown points of view in a framework with the largest\npossible audience and resonance. This is why my country\ntakes an active part in debates on issues of importance to\nthe international community, pertaining to the maintenance\nof peace and international security, to social and economic\ndevelopment, to the expansion of international and regional\ncooperation, to fighting terrorism and to increasing the\nrole and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nThe far-reaching changes in international life at the\nend of this century have left their imprint on the activities\nof the United Nations. That is why we must strengthen\nand further improve the United Nations system so as to\nrenew and adapt the Organization to the increased\ndemands of international cooperation. Today, more than\na year after the new initiatives were launched by the\nSecretary-General, we observe that his proposals,\nrecommendations and specific measures for reforming the\nUnited Nations correspond to a large extent to these\ndemands.\nMy delegation welcomes the progress achieved in\nthe reform process of the United Nations, particularly in\nthe economic and social spheres, and supports the\nmeasures to streamline and make more efficient the\nactivities of the Organization. We believe that the\nmerging of some structures, as well as decentralization\nand the transfer of authority to field offices will make an\nessential contribution to adapting the United Nations to\nnew requirements. We believe that the debates during this\nsession on proposals and measures for the restructuring of\nthe entire United Nations system will have an impact on\nother areas of the Organization?s activities.\nThe increase in the number of Security Council\nmembers is the crux of the overall reform of the United\nNations. Since, thus far, we have not found generally\nacceptable solutions pertaining to the various aspects of\nthe issue of reforming the Security Council, we believe\nthat during this session Member States should show the\nsame spirit of compromise as that shown by the Working\nGroup on the Security Council question.\nWhile taking into account the need to ensure better\nrepresentation of Member States in the Security Council,\nthe Republic of Moldova, as at previous sessions,\ncontinues to be in favour of a moderate expansion in the\nnumber of Council members. New permanent seats should\nbe granted to developed countries such as Germany and\nJapan, as the Republic of Moldova has advocated at\nseveral previous sessions of the General Assembly, and\npossibly to developing countries as well.\nRegarding the number of non-permanent seats, the\nRepublic of Moldova is in favour of a reasonable increase\nin accordance with the principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation so as to reflect the interests of all regional\ngroups. To our mind, an increase in the number of the\n4\n\n\nmembers of the Security Council in that category should\ntake into account the legitimate interest of States of Central\nand Eastern Europe in having an additional, non-permanent\nseat since in recent years the number of States in that\nregion has doubled.\nChanges that have taken place in recent years in States\nwith transitional economies, including the Republic of\nMoldova, have shown that political and economic changes\ninvolve risks and difficulties that affect several areas of\nsociety. Major problems, such as a decline in production,\nare too complex to be solved only with one?s own\nresources.\nIn such circumstances, the role of the United Nations\nsystem in the economic and social spheres takes on a new\ndimension. The United Nations must remain the framework\nfor international cooperation for all nations. This, in fact, is\nan absolute necessity in the current situation, in which\nfinancial crises have affected the economies of several\ncountries, thereby jeopardizing their political and economic\nreforms.\nCommitted to the path of democracy, the Republic of\nMoldova is steadily striving to create basic institutions for\nthe rule of law and the legislative framework necessary for\ntransition to a market economy. As a result, we have been\nable to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and have\nreduced the annual inflation rate to 12 per cent.\nMy country takes an active part in international\ncooperation within the framework of the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation, the South-East European\nCooperative Initiative, the Central European Initiative and\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\nSimilarly, the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation\nAgreement with the European Union has considerably\ndiversified economic relations for the Republic of Moldova.\nMy country also attaches crucial importance to its\nforthcoming adherence to the World Trade Organization.\nLike other Member States, including those with\neconomies in transition, the Republic of Moldova has taken\npart in United Nations projects in the economic and social\nsphere and is benefiting from the assistance and support of\nthe United Nations to promote economic reform. This is\nwhy we greatly appreciate the activities of the United\nNations Development Programme.\nThe economic decline in Asia has engendered a world\neconomic crisis with devastating consequences. As the\nSecretary-General has said, the world economic crisis has\nbeen felt in Russia, in North America and in Europe.\nToday, major economies are increasingly feeling the\nimpact of events taking place in less developed areas of\nthe world.\nIn the process of the globalization of the world\neconomy, the United Nations could serve as a\ncoordinating centre for creating an international financial\nstructure.\nManaging the crisis and the effects of globalization\nalso has particular importance for countries with\neconomies in transition. Those States find themselves at\nthe stage of moving towards a market economy, which\nrequires the achievement of a whole set of objectives,\nsuch as macroeconomic stabilization, reform of price-\nsetting mechanisms, restructuring of the major sectors of\nthe economy, reduction of inflation, creation of new jobs\nand, last but not least, integration into the world economy.\nFinally, it is important in our view that, in seeking\nsolutions to the problems facing States with economies in\ntransition, we should take into account first and foremost\nthe specific characteristics of each country. We must take\ninto consideration the fact that economic recovery in this\ncategory of countries is a complex problem because of the\nparticularities of each State.\nWe hope that the United Nations will enhance its\npresence in States with economies in transition through\nregional economic commissions, as well as through funds\nand specialized agencies. We also deem it useful in this\nregard to consider the question of the integration of the\neconomies of countries in transition into the world\neconomy.\nIn the context of the debate on reform in the\neconomic sphere, I wish to note that my country supports\ndecisions adopted by the General Assembly and by the\nEconomic and Social Council regarding an increase in\ndevelopment assistance and effective coordination of\nactivities of the regional commissions with other bodies\nof the United Nations system.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights is yet another\nreason to intensify efforts to promote and protect human\nrights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world.\nThe Republic of Moldova greatly appreciates United\nNations human rights activities and supports the reform\nmeasures that have been adopted, in particular those\n5\n\n\npertaining to strengthening the role of the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nMy country attaches special importance to the\npromotion and protection of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms. The Republic of Moldova has acceded to the\nmajor international legal instruments on human rights\nadopted within the framework of the United Nations, the\nCouncil of Europe and the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Our Parliament has ratified\na series of international conventions such as the\nInternational Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural\nRights and on Civil and Political Rights. The Parliament of\nthe Republic of Moldova has adopted more than 20 laws\ndealing expressly with human rights. Respect for and\nprotection of human rights in my country are also\nsafeguarded by the Constitutional Court, which has the final\nsay on the Constitution, by the principle of the separation\nof powers, and by the responsibility of the State towards its\ncitizens.\nThe major events of the past decade have had a\nconsiderable impact on the situation in various parts of the\nworld. Sometimes these events have been complicated by\nsocial tension and by serious violations of human rights,\nand have even given rise to armed conflicts.\nIt is known that the conflict in the eastern part of the\nRepublic of Moldova in the summer of 1992 was caused by\nthe dismantling of the USSR and that it was supported by\nforces wishing to preserve the old political system.\nUnfortunately, we were unable to avoid that tragic situation.\nEven though the conflict has ceased, its consequences\nremain. There has been no final settlement of the conflict,\nand to some extent this is an obstacle to the process of the\ndemocratization of society and to the promotion of\ndemocratic reforms. Serious human rights violations\ncontinue in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova.\nMembers of the Ilascu group have not yet been released; in\nthe meantime, Prisoner Ilascu has actually been elected as\na Deputy in the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova.\nThe efforts of the Republic of Moldova to settle this\nconflict peacefully, and my country?s readiness to grant that\nregion special status with broad authority, on the condition\nthat it respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the\nRepublic of Moldova, are well known.\nBut I have to recall that we are still facing difficulties\nin the negotiating process that took place with the\ncooperation of the OSCE and representatives of the Russian\nFederation and of Ukraine as mediators. The irreconcilable\nposition of the separatist leaders has blocked the full\nimplementation of agreements signed with the help of the\nmediators, which were intended to be interim documents\nthat could help renew negotiations and increase trust\namong the parties. The situation is further aggravated by\nthe presence in the region of vast quantities of weapons\nand ammunition and vast numbers of foreign troops.\nHowever, on 21 October 1994 the Republic of\nMoldova and the Russian Federation signed an agreement\non the withdrawal of armaments and military personnel.\nUnfortunately the Russians have yet to ratify that\nagreement. Implementation of the agreement would be in\nline with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of the\nRepublic of Moldova, which stipulates the neutrality of\nour State and bans the deployment of foreign troops on\nour territory.\nWe believe that the immediate withdrawal of these\nvast quantities of weapons and ammunition would\nconsiderably strengthen stability in the region while\nfacilitating the process of settling the crisis. In that\ncontext, we hope that the OSCE mission in the Republic\nof Moldova and the mediator States, the Russian\nFederation and Ukraine, will intensify their efforts to\nbring about the resumption of negotiations in conformity\nwith the principle of respect for the independence,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of\nMoldova, and that they will contribute to the withdrawal\nof the weapons, ammunition and troops. This would\ndefuse the conflict and would create conditions propitious\nfor its final settlement. Finally, I state solemnly that the\nRepublic of Moldova remains open to dialogue and will\ncontinue to try to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\nWe hope that common sense will prevail.\nThe problems facing humankind as we come to the\nend of this century are many and complex. Although the\nthreat of another world war has been diminished,\nhumanity must face a multitude of conflicts and tensions\nthat jeopardize peace and stability in many parts of the\nworld.\nI believe that we must make use of all our\nexperience, and focus all our efforts to resolve current\ncrises and to prevent conflicts. In my view, we can face\ntoday?s challenges and ensure world peace and security\nonly through joint action by the international community.\nAt this stage of ongoing globalization, the United Nations,\nwith its universal mission, remains the principal forum in\nwhich to find solutions to crucial issues. My country is\nready to cooperate with all other Member States to\n6\n\n\nstrengthen the Organization?s capacity better to meet the\nchallenges of the coming millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The urgency of the\nalarming situation in Afghanistan, particularly given the\nevents of the past few months, requires me to explain why\nand how that situation continues to pose major threats to\nthe peace and security of the world.\nThere is an evil triangle that is haunting our region.\nThis evil triangle has imprisoned and terrorized an entire\nnation. It has almost engulfed our region in a major\nconfrontation. The spread of this evil triangle like a plague\nis about to contaminate the entire area, setting off alarm\nbells from the Far East to the Far West, even echoing in\nfaraway capitals of the world. The evil triangle I am\nreferring to is one between: first, the Pakistani military\nInter-Service Intelligence (ISI); secondly, branches of\ninternational terrorism and drug traffickers operating from\nAfghanistan; and thirdly, the infamous Taliban militia.\nOn 7 August 1998, two African capitals suffered\nmajor explosions, sending a shock wave of international\nterrorism throughout the world. The following day, nine\nIranian diplomats and a journalist were ferociously\ngunned down inside the Consulate-General of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran in Mazar-i-Sharif. According to Amnesty\nInternational, from 8 to 10 August thousands of ethnic\nHazara civilians were killed in Mazar-i-Sharif. On 21\nAugust 1998, Lieutenant-Colonel Carmine Calo, Military\nAdviser to the United Nations Special Mission to\nAfghanistan, an Italian national, was brutally murdered by\ntwo Pakistani terrorists on assignment in Kabul. All of\nthese shocking events have one thing in common: the\nimplementation of an anachronistic socio-political agenda\nby means of destructive force and violence and the\nadventurous hegemony of the Pakistani army in the\nregion. These things pose a direct threat to regional peace\nand security.\nThree major concerns \u2014 namely, terrorism, drugs\nand the violation of human rights \u2014 are originating in the\nTaliban-held areas of Afghanistan, but they are being\ninstigated from across the border. During the twelfth\nsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement, on 3 September\n1998 in Durban, South Africa, President Burhanuddin\nRabbani brought these issues to the attention of the\nsummit. In its paragraphs on terrorism the Final\nDocument of the summit says it is imperative that no\nState organize, assist or participate in terrorist acts in the\nterritories of other States or encourage activities directed\ntowards such acts, including permitting the use of national\nterritory or the soil of a neighbouring country for\nplanning and training for such a purpose and or the\nfinancing of terrorist activities. Paragraph 153 of the Final\nDocument states that the heads of State or Government\nsolemnly reaffirmed their unequivocal condemnation of\nany political, diplomatic, moral or material support for\nterrorism. We fully agree with the generally expressed\nview that the global phenomenon of terrorism requires a\ncollective and concerted response.\nAfghanistan, along with other members of the Non-\nAligned Movement, also condemns the practice of\nrecruiting, financing, training, using or supporting\nmercenaries as a violation of the purposes and principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Let us make it clear\nonce again here that the Taliban are Pakistani\nmercenaries.\n26\n\n\nOn 28 August 1998, pursuant to the deterioration of\nthe situation stemming from a whole new series of military\nactivities evidently directed by the cross-border ISI officers,\nthe Security Council adopted an important resolution, 1193\n(1998), for which President Rabbani voiced his firm support\nat the Durban summit. However, the response of the\nTaliban mercenaries and their cross-border patrons to the\nresolution \u2014 a major assault on Bamyan valley on 14\nSeptember, during which the most atrocious acts were\ncommitted against the civilian population of the valley \u2014\nwas yet another vow to continue their military agenda.\nPresently, the only country that takes pride in\nrecognizing the Taliban and in fact urges others to do the\nsame remains Pakistan. The Pakistani meddling in\nAfghanistan \u2014 which has direct consequences for Pakistan\nitself and the entire region \u2014 has best been summarized in\nthe Pakistani daily The News on 25 September 1998. I\nquote:\n\u201cNorth-West Asia is in great trouble and the Taliban\nare the catalyst behind it. The Taliban have not just\ndragged Iran and the Central Asian republics into the\nconflict, they have also pushed Pakistan into a tense\nrelationship with all its Muslim neighbours. What was\nsupposed to provide Pakistan with strategic depth'\nhas turned into a quagmire. Islamabad is now faced\nwith yet another critical choice between either cutting\nTaliban to size or siding with them against friendly\nneighbours.\u201d\nThe article continues, and I quote,\n\u201cIf somebody thinks that with the Taliban victory\na lasting peace will be restored in Afghanistan and\npeace dividends will start flowing in, he is sadly\nmistaken.\u201d\nHeadlines such as \u201cCrises push Pakistan to the brink\nof disaster\u201d in the Washington Post of 26 September are\nearly warnings about a state of affairs that will affect the\nentire region. In fact, when a fragile and vulnerable country\nlike Pakistan involves itself in a great game, as the Afghani\npeople say, it digs its own grave.\nArticle 1 of the United Nations Charter calls for\neffective and collective measures for the prevention and\nremoval of threats to peace. Consistent with this, the\nIslamic State of Afghanistan, over the past three years, has\nrepeatedly warned the international community of the\nmounting threat to regional peace and security posed by the\nPakistani Government?s military intelligence service, (ISI),\nand its mercenaries, the Taliban, in Afghanistan.\nUnfortunately, these early warnings have all gone\nunheard.\nToday, the exacerbated situation in Afghanistan and\nits menacing implications for the region and beyond are\nexactly what we deserve. The international community\nmust admit that it has done too little in the face of the\nincreasingly bold and aggressive ISI policy towards\nAfghanistan and has gone too far with its policy of\nappeasement towards the Taliban in their fight against the\nrest of the world. The Security Council must determine\nthe existence of this threat to peace, breach of the peace\nand act of aggression by Pakistan, and should take\nappropriate measures against the perpetrators in\nconformity with Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter. The\nalarming situation in Afghanistan requires definitive\naction by the Security Council. It is time that the presence\nof about 28,000 armed Pakistanis in Afghanistan was\ndealt with in accordance with Article 39 of the United\nNations Charter.\nThe Taliban?s obstinately rejectionist and\nintransigent attitude towards peace and human rights is\nwell known to the international community. Let us recall\nonce again how the Taliban?s retrograde militia, helped\nand patronized by their cross-border allies, visualize and\nconceive the events in Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban have their own answer to every issue\nraised by the United Nations and the international\ncommunity. When asked to establish a broad-based\nrepresentative Government, the Taliban reply that they\nhave brought many parts of Afghanistan under their\nmilitary domination and that this is a broad-based\nrepresentative Government. When requested to hold\nelections in Afghanistan, the Taliban state that elections\nare unIslamic. They say that other Muslim countries\nwhich adhere to the principle of elections have\noverlooked the true teachings of Islam. When told to\nrespect human rights, the Taliban reply that they have\ntheir own standards for human rights. They say that\nhuman rights in other Muslim countries are not based on\nIslam.\nIn response to constant appeals to respect the human\nrights of women and reopen girls? schools, the Taliban,\nquoted in The Washington Post of 25 September 1998,\nsay that\n27\n\n\n\u201cthe countries that shout about freedom for women\nwant to use them only for prostitution and\nentertainment until they get old and useless\u201d.\nThe Taliban say they know best what to do with women\nand girls.\nWhen asked to put an end to drug production and\ntrafficking, the Taliban say that, though produced in\nAfghanistan, narcotics are consumed overseas. They also\nsay that drug production and smuggling, operations which\nthe Taliban and some Pakistani military officers jointly\nmaintain, earn them profits. When asked to hold\nnegotiations with the parties to the conflict, the Taliban,\nagain quoted in The Washington Post, say that their first\npriority has been to disarm the opposition and that\nnegotiations will follow only then.\nPeace has no place on the Taliban agenda. Even when\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, the Secretary-General?s Special\nEnvoy, urged them to attend the face-to-face talks with us,\nheld in Ashgabat on 5 April 1998, they did not participate.\nOn 25 April 1998, the negotiations between both sides in\nIslamabad \u2014 under the supervision of the United Nations\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) \u2014\nwere unilaterally abandoned by the Taliban and the\nceasefire observed at the request of the United Nations and\nthe United States was pre-emptively broken by a major\nTaliban offensive north of Kabul. Because of the failure of\nthe Taliban?s military offensive, they returned the following\nday, 26 April, for further negotiations, but soon unilaterally\nand definitively abandoned the negotiations once more, as\nnoted by the Secretary-General.\nIn essence, the Taliban?s intransigence stems from\ntheir firm and stubborn conviction that the only solution is\na military solution. This conviction is also indicative of the\nideas of their Pakistani mentors, who are determined to\ndominate Afghanistan. Thus, any and all efforts to reach a\npeaceful solution have been intentionally thwarted. It came\nas a surprise to no one that the Taliban not only refused to\nattend the intra-Afghan gathering on 18 July 1998 in Bonn,\nGermany, which sought to initiate what was hoped would\nbe the traditional grand assembly, or Loya jirgah, but also,\none week earlier, condemned the all-Afghan gathering and\nlaunched major military operations, supported by the\nPakistani air force, in northern Afghanistan.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan strongly confirms the\nviews that have been expressed in this Assembly for years\nthat there is no military solution to the conflict in\nAfghanistan. The withdrawal of foreign military and\narmed personnel and the return of the opposition to the\nnegotiating table for a political dialogue aimed at\nachieving a lasting political settlement of the conflict,\nalong with the formation of a fully representative, broad-\nbased, multi-ethnic Government, are the main points that\ncould ensure an environment of peace in Afghanistan and\nthe entire region.\nWe are proposing such an intra-Afghan dialogue\nwithout delay or precondition, on the basis of the\nfollowing principles, which emanate from our national\nplatform and international commitment to Article 2,\nparagraph 2 of the United Nations Charter, as well to as\nour tenets and culture.\nFirst, concerning the principles of Islam, the Islamic\ntenets and teachings are guidelines of supreme value, in\ncompliance with which the future political system, the\nconstitution and other laws shall be founded.\nSecondly, the principle of democracy and pluralism\nshall constitute the mainspring of the future political\nsystem to be formed in Afghanistan.\nThirdly, concerning the principle of human rights,\nthe observation of and respect for human rights \u2014\nincluding the rights of women and girls to education,\nwork and beneficial coexistence in harmony with the\nprovisions of human rights instruments \u2014 are among the\nprinciples that shall be integral parts of any peace\nagreement. This shows our commitment as a member of\nthe international community.\nFourthly, the principle of elections and the\ndelegation of authority to local government shall be\nincorporated into any peace agreement as urgent and\nnecessary elements of confidence-building and as the\nrealization of the will of the people. Local administrations\nand their leaders, including the members of provincial\ncouncils, shall all be elected. The central representative\nGovernment, to be equitably accommodating to all ethnic\ngroups and segments of Afghan society, shall function\nconstitutionally.\nFifthly, as to the principles of permanent neutrality\nand independence, countries of the region and the\ninternational community shall recognize the permanent\nneutrality of Afghanistan. Afghanistan will never enter\ninto any political or military alliance against any State\nand Afghan soil will not be used as a base for hostilities\nagainst another State. International relations shall be\n28\n\n\nconducted independently, in a manner consistent with the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nAfghanistan shall actively participate in the processes of\nregional economic cooperation, transit and transport of\ntrade. It shall be a good partner in the community of\nnations.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the\nmeeting of the \u201cSix plus Two\u201d group, held at the level of\nForeign Ministers in New York on 21 September 1998.\nAfghanistan fully agrees with the points of common\nunderstanding and expresses its firm support for the\nSecretary-General?s decision to send his Special Envoy,\nAmbassador Lakhdar Brahimi, to the region. Afghanistan\nremains committed to giving his mission its full\ncooperation.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan firmly supports the\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations, rightly referred\nto as a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d by the Secretary-General.\nSimilarly, the establishment of a Development Account and\nthe United Nations Fund for International Partnerships,\namong other innovations, deserve the support of Member\nStates. However, the least developed countries and in\nparticular those stricken by war, have to be given priority\nattention in this field.\nIn their Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations, Member States\npromised to\n\u201cgive to the twenty-first century a United Nations\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively\nthe peoples in whose name it was established\u201d.\n(resolution 50/6)\nThis has to include the institutional framework of the\nOrganization, namely, a Security Council with working\nmethods and a composition that better reflect today?s needs\nand realities.\nThe Working Group that has been mandated to\nexamine this question will soon start its sixth year of\nintensive discussions. These discussions cannot go on\nindefinitely. It is time to set a concrete agenda and to act if\nwe want to meet the challenges of the next millennium.\nAfghanistan therefore supports an overall reform which\nwould make the Security Council?s work more transparent\nand its composition more representative. This would mean\npermanent seats for the developing and the developed\nworld, the latter to include global economic players such as\nGermany and Japan. At the same time, a sufficient number\nof non-permanent seats should be added to take into\naccount the interests of smaller and medium-sized\ncountries. The Charter therefore must be amended in\norder drastically to reduce the use of the right of veto,\nwhich is most undemocratic. The coming century requires\na Security Council that conforms with the new landscape\nof the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I would also like to\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for\nhis important contribution during the last session.\nIn addition, may I also thank the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous efforts to transform\nour United Nations into a more effective instrument for\npromoting peace and enhancing the well-being of the\npeople of the world as we move into a new millennium.\n\nThe restructuring of the Security Council with a\nview to properly reflecting the present international\neconomic and political reality and to meeting the new\nchallenges of the next millennium is of fundamental\nimportance. My delegation believes that the discussions\nshould not be limited to the mere expansion of the\nCouncil, but should rather address the improvement of its\neffectiveness and its adherence to the principle of our\nCharter that all States are equal. We would like to\nemphasize that my delegation fully underscores the\nposition taken by the Non-Aligned Movement, most\nrecently at its twelfth summit meeting in Durban, South\nAfrica.\nSuriname is pleased with the call by the Secretary-\nGeneral for greater cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations in preventing conflicts.\nIn the western hemisphere, it is mainly the Organization\nof American States and the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) which have often demonstrated their\ncapabilities of overcoming seemingly insurmountable\nhurdles by preventing or ending conflicts between and\nwithin member States.\nAllow me to raise some matters of equally serious\ninternational concern that require urgent attention. A\ndisturbing and despicable phenomenon, which we all must\ncondemn in the strongest terms, is the senseless attacks\non and even killing of international civil servants,\nincluding United Nations field officers. Since these heroic\nmen and women are contributing to the cause of\nhumanity, crimes committed against them must be treated\nas crimes against humanity and punished accordingly.\nRecent terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe and elsewhere\nhave once more shocked the international community and\nhave left us in a state of dismay.\n5\n\n\nThe Republic of Suriname condemns international\nterrorism and welcomes the conclusion of regional\nagreements and mutually agreed declarations to combat and\neliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nMy Government deeply deplores the fact that the\nprocess for durable peace and reconciliation in the Middle\nEast has again been stalled and the current situation\ncontinues the great suffering of the Palestinian people and\nuncertainty for the people of Israel. We call upon all sides\nto re-establish mutual confidence and call on the\ninternational community to exert every influence on the\nparties concerned to save the peace process.\nIt is recognized that the phenomenon of globalization\npresents a challenge for the Caribbean region, and requires\nfundamental changes in our economies and in the\ndevelopmental process of the region, while increasing the\nrisk of marginalization for all vulnerable economies.\nIn this regard, we share the view that the small\nCaribbean States should be granted a reasonable period for\nadjustment to the changing international environment, in\norder to enable us to improve our competitiveness, and a\nnon-reciprocal preferential system must be maintained\nduring that transition period. This will allow for a more\nrealistic transition, which will eventually facilitate better\nadaptation of our economies.\nMore than ever, the interdependence of States has\nbecome clear, now that the negative consequences of\nglobalization have recently manifested themselves in a\ndramatic manner for many of our member States. I\ntherefore make an urgent appeal to all responsible actors\ninvolved in the world economy, including the international\nfinancial institutions and monetary authorities, to adjust\ntheir relevant policies so as to redress the structural,\nfinancial and economic imbalances and adverse effects that\nhave risen.\nWe call upon all nuclear-weapon States to accede to\nand fully implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. We are convinced that the new Department for\nDisarmament and Arms Regulation will bolster the capacity\nof the United Nations to pursue these objectives, bearing in\nmind the ruling by the International Court of Justice in July\n1996 that the use of, or the threat to use, nuclear weapons\nis contrary to international humanitarian law.\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, Suriname wishes\nto reiterate its commitment to these rights. At the same\ntime, my Government holds the view that it is equally\nimportant not to focus our attention solely on the\nfulfilment of civil and political rights; we should also\nfocus on the fulfilment of the social and economic rights\nof our peoples.\nIt is in this respect that Suriname believes that the\nimplementation of the \u201cRight of Development\u201d, in\nparticular for peoples in the developing world, must be\ngiven equal attention by the international community.\nWhat should be stressed in this context is that human\nrights and sustainable human development are\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. The promotion\nof human rights is, indeed, of particular relevance in a\nglobalized world, with its potential to marginalize the\nweak and small States, particularly those with limited\nresources.\nSuriname takes part in the General Assembly debate\nwith a sense of pride, since it has demonstrated to the\nworld its acceptance of responsibility for the protection of\nthe environment by preserving one of the most pristine\nforests on this globe for conservation purposes. My\ncountry has recently created the Central Suriname Nature\nReserve, comprising 1.6 million hectares and 12 per cent\nof the territory of the Republic of Suriname. This nature\nreserve, one of the largest nature reserves in South\nAmerica and possibly the single most pristine tropical\narea on Earth, is our gift to humankind for eternity. I\nconsider this gift a special contribution to, among other\nthings, the safeguarding of one of the fundamental human\nrights of the world population, namely, the right to life.\nWe hope that other nations will follow this example and\ncommit themselves to the protection of the forests of our\nworld.\nThe information superhighway facilitates the\nexchange of information and can also contribute to the\ndevelopment and the promotion of public awareness\nworldwide. However, I must also express my sincere\nconcern about the possible negative consequences of the\nmisuse of this form of technology, which could have\nadverse effects on all strata of our communities, including\nour youth. It deserves serious consideration to develop\nand implement legislative measures to prevent any form\nof misuse of this form of technology, without in any\nrespect jeopardizing the fundamental right of free\nexpression.\nAs a result of the twentieth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to the world drug problem,\n6\n\n\nSuriname is now in the final stage of organizing a\nsubregional conference on the drug problem, the aim of\nwhich is to establish a plan of action in cooperation with\nGuyana, Venezuela, Brazil and France, in order to\neffectively combat this form of organized crime.\nFinally, I am pleased to conclude that since our last\nAssembly reform of our Organization has been well on its\nway, with a renewed emphasis on economic, social and\ndevelopment activities, and the need to implement its\nmission of peace, development and human rights in a more\neffective manner.\nWe must continue to revitalize the United Nations,\nsince it is our universal instrument for concerted action in\nthe pursuit of our noble aim of the betterment of\nhumankind. It bears repeating, again and again, that the\nmajority of the key conflicts in the world, and the threats\nto the world community, can only be solved or averted\nthrough the strengthening of our multilateral mechanism.\nThe United Nations must be that mechanism. Our\ncombined political will should be its new life; a new life\nfor the challenges of the new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Uruguay comes to the Assembly today with happiness,\npride and even excitement at seeing you, Sir, a\ncountryman of ours, representing Uruguay, as President\nof the Assembly. Uruguay was a founding Member of the\nUnited Nations and has been one of the its most active\nparticipants ever since, in all its endeavours. It has even\ncontributed its best soldiers, who put their lives on the\nline every day in the difficult peacekeeping operations of\nthe United Nations.\nOur country came to this Organization at the time of\nits founding with the hopes and dreams of a world that\nwas being rebuilt in order to usher in a time of peace,\n19\n\n\nprosperity and stability. It certainly did not come here with\nany dreams of power, which could have had no place in our\ncountry given its small land area and relatively small\neconomy. But we did harbour the dream that has inspired\nall our great statesmen \u2014 that of being a small, model\ncountry which in the past century made secular education\nuniversal, free and compulsory and built a State of well-\nbeing with a solid middle class as the foundation of its\npolitical democracy. Thus did our country feel that it was\na fundamental part of the democratic development of\nnations.\nUnfortunately, we were not exempt from the upheavals\nand consequences of the cold war. As the Assembly knows,\nthe cold war was bloody and fierce in Latin America. The\nhemispheres were locked in a state of conflict over\npositions: here guerrilla wars and there coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, both\nmanifestations themselves as part of a hellish dialectic in\nwhich democracies were wounded and sometimes fell.\nThe last few years have shown Uruguay to be a\ncountry which is making strides in its economy and\nprosperity and which, as the recently published United\nNations Human Development Index states, is once again\nmaking progress. It ranks third among developing countries,\nand we can say that we have attained the best improvement\nin the hemisphere with regard to poverty indicators.\nHowever, we come to this session not only with the\nconcerns about its institutions and peace which always\npermeate the spirit of the Assembly; we come here also\nhaving seen the spectre of a crisis which began as an Asian\nfinancial crisis and which today is a global economic crisis\nthat touches all of us. This undoubtedly deserves particular\nconcern. When we see stock markets carried away by a\nmicroclimate of psychosis, and when we see so many\nirrational phenomena spread, we feel like Anatole France,\nwho saw life as a struggle among various forces, of which\nwe are not always able to know which is the strongest. At\ntimes it seems that science and intelligence predominate. At\nother times it seems that lunacy and fear prevail. This is\nalso part of this phenomenon that started as a financial\ncrisis and then became a very peculiar psychological\nphenomenon. The point is that, both as Latin Americans\nand as a member State of the international community, we\nmust once again face this situation.\nShakespeare, who is often quoted in connection with\nmajor tragedies, said that fate dealt the cards but we were\nthe players. That is our challenge today: how to play our\ncards in this crisis which could even affect not just finances\nand economies but also the democratic stability of our\ncountries, our social peace and the fundamental values\nwhich inspire us.\nIn the 1980s Latin America went through very\ndifficult economic years. This is referred to \u2014 mistakenly\nin my judgement \u2014 as the lost decade, for those were\nalso the years in which we consolidated the strongest\nprocess of democratization in our continent, which today\nallows it to have more democracies and freedoms than\never before. Countries which had never before known\ndemocracy are now building republics and institutions and\ndeveloping their societies.\nThe fact is that after that crisis our countries made\nenormous efforts at transformation. They lowered their\nrates of inflation, opened up their economies and began\nstrong processes of integration \u2014 in the Andean area, in\nMexico to the north and with us in the south, Argentina,\nBrazil and Uruguay, and now with Bolivia and Chile as\nassociate partners, to the south. All of this meant that we\nhad a Latin America which was growing again and which\nwould once again be a place for investments; a Latin\nAmerica which was able to harmonize the return of\ndemocracy and peace with economic growth.\nWe now find ourselves faced with the new crisis.\nWhat should we do? In our view, the first thing to do is\nto consolidate and support the Organization and the\ninternational community. We should do that here, in this\ninstitution, which is a hymn to internationalism, as well\nas in the economic area. The International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank \u2014 which is the main source of\nfinancing for our hemisphere \u2014 are the tools we rely on\ntoday. We must strengthen them.\nIndeed, this crisis will leave behind consequences\nonce it is over. Somehow the debate that took place\nbetween Lord Keynes and Harry White, at the time of the\nestablishment of the International Monetary Fund at\nBretton Woods, hangs over the world today. The British\neconomist held the view that it was necessary to have a\ncentral bank of central banks. I shall not bring in that\ndebate here today, but I think that it will nevertheless\nhave to take place once the crucial moments of this crisis\nare over, because of the need for prevention and for a\nmarket economy which actually works.\nWe must all feel and know that the origins of this\ncrisis have been identified. First, there has been excessive\nspeculation, which has been clearly reflected in stock\nmarkets. It also stems from macroeconomic imbalances in\n20\n\n\nmany States, which have not been able to correct those\nimbalances, mainly their fiscal gaps, that have been\nfundamental causes of this situation.\nFortunately, the North American economy and the\nEuropean economy still appear to be solid. Japan is the\ncountry of which we are all hoping for a recovery so that\nthe measures under way today will allow us to view much\nmore calmly the future of this situation, which could very\nwell continue for a long time. As the Brazilian Foreign\nMinister said today, the magnitude and the duration of this\ncrisis are unpredictable, but what should not be\nunpredictable is the behaviour of States.\nTherefore, it is essential that we act to bring to an end\nthose financial imbalances and avoid the mistakes and\ntemptations related to such crises. First, we should not\nbelieve that by isolating ourselves in neo-protectionism we\nwill find a way out of the crisis.\nIn Latin America in the 1980s we had an external debt\ncrisis. There were those who advocated not repaying the\ndebt and returning in some way to more protected\neconomies. There were those of us, on the other hand, who\nthought that the debt should be refinanced and that we\nshould join the international community more actively and\nin that way grow again. Only by growing our economies\ncould the external debt be made manageable in the future.\nThe former, unfortunately, were not lucky and the latter,\nfortunately, were. In that way, we were able to refinance\nthe external debt and return to investment, and growth\nenabled us to pay off the debt effectively and thus achieve\nbetter living conditions for our peoples.\nTurmoil and speculation are not what are most needed\nfor the prosperity of needy peoples. To the contrary, profit-\nmaking opportunities for speculators come at the expense\nof the majority.\nThat is the path that we see clearly defined today for\nthis situation, and we must all redouble our efforts in that\ndirection. We will also have to strengthen anew the\ninternational financial community so that there can exist a\nreal international safety net that will allow us to work in\npeace.\nOf course, the leading economic countries have a great\nresponsibility. President Clinton said last week that this was\nthe most important economic and financial crisis of the\nsecond half of the century, and no doubt it is. That is all\nthe more reason for the major economies to assume their\nresponsibilities and for smaller economies, such as ours,\nwhich basically seeks more and more equitable living\nconditions, to try not to bring bad news to the world,\neven while lacking the capacity and opportunity to be\nthose who can offer the world good news.\nWe should thus protect ourselves from a dangerous\nneo-protectionism and continue to fight for increasingly\nopen and transparent markets, from which the persistent\nsubsidies in the large States disappear \u2014 subsidies in the\nUnited States and the European Community, agricultural\nsubsidies which undoubtedly are a troublesome factor in\ninternational economic activities and must be left behind.\nIf the crisis teaches us anything, it is that we must find\nbalance, and balance will not be found on the basis of\nsubsidies which continue to promote opportunity for\nartificial economic sectors.\nWe must also protect ourselves from messianic\ndemagoguery, which is the political dimension of this\ncrisis. For that reason, warding off and resolving the crisis\nthrough international cooperation and concrete measures\nare also very important in a democratic context. When\nsuch instabilities occur, messianic demagogues appear, all\nthose pyrotechnists of prosperity who have always led\npeoples to misfortune and to whom we should not offer,\nthrough instability, another opportunity.\nThis is therefore a financial and economic crisis, and\nultimately a crisis in political democracy. It is the\nfundamental chapter through which we must continue to\nwork here.\nOur world is living in disconcerting times. In 1989,\nit seemed, with the market economy triumphant over the\nsocialist economy and liberal democracy triumphant over\nthe Communist world, that we were entering an era of\npeace and stability in which the old Hegelian dialectics\nwould yield to a world of synthesis \u2014 what was termed\nthe end of history, what others called the pens\u00e9e unique.\nUndoubtedly, that was an oversimplification.\nToday it would also be an oversimplification to\nbelieve that we have once again entered the crisis of\ncapitalism. In my long political career, I have been\ninvited many times to the funeral of capitalism. Times\nhave definitely shown that the market economy, with its\ndynamics and its spirit of initiative, once again recovered,\nand this will happen again now because no one is\npointing to a better alternative.\nTherefore, we must not fall into another\noversimplification. At one point we believed that the\n21\n\n\nsimple freeing of markets would bring about the miraculous\nresult of achieving growth and equity; we cannot now\nreturn to the past and believe that through closed\neconomies, through stronger protectionist measures or even\nthrough authoritarianism we will be able to resolve a\nsituation that, now more than ever, must be addressed with\nthe guidance of democratic principles.\nNo one has a clear road map. Thus, there is all the\nmore reason to reaffirm the basic principles, the first one\nbeing political democracy, which calls on us, as President\nClinton said earlier, to fight against terrorism, which\nthrough violence attacks democracy, in all its forms, from\nthe outside; and to fight against the enemies which\ndemocracy generates from within. At times we have\nsuffered from excessive political passion, which sometimes\nleads to divisions within countries, intolerance, racial\nhatred, abuse of economic power and abuse of the media;\nall of these factors are part of a democracy, but when used\nwithout ethical limits they may weaken it.\nWe also have a right to ask the citizen to participate.\nIt is not through an alienated or indifferent citizenry that\ndemocracy will be strengthened. Democracy will be closely\nrelated to an efficient State, for only an efficient State can\nstand united if the objective is to improve the lives of our\npeople, only a State which is not a mechanism for waste,\nbut rather a strong instrument to promote the forces of\nsociety; to a market economy and increasingly open trade\nbased on standards that protect us from unfair competition;\nand to a process of integration such as those being carried\nout in the Latin American countries to enable us to join the\nworld with suitable economies to improve our production.\nWe must also think of the basic values of our\nsocieties, such as the family, which is the historic nucleus\nof our civilization. The weakening of the family has come\nat a high price. Today, the drug trade reflects the spiritual\nscourge of societies which, in their economic development,\nhave lost sight of spiritual values. Such societies have\nweakened the family in a world where images, emptiness\nand passing trends have caused a vacuum that in turn\ncauses the phenomenon of the search for artificial paradises\nthat aim to replace a meaningful life. We must enhance\nspiritual factors to give democracies genuine content.\nWe must, of course, be pragmatical in economic\nmatters, but pragmatism alone will not keep alive the hopes\nof peoples. We must strengthen family values, human\ndignity and the universality of human rights, as our friend\nPresident Mandela has said. We must all respect ethnic\nindividuality; in the final analysis we are all the same. We\nmust all fight against racial discrimination; we must all\nrespect and be very mindful of cultural diversity. But no\nethnic or cultural diversity can sanction the enslavement\nof women or the killing of men: we are speaking here of\nuniversal values that are essential to the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and that we must not only\nproclaim but must also practice.\nAs Toynbee said, \u201cCivilization is a movement and\nnot a condition, a voyage and not a harbour\u201d (Readers\nDigest, October 1958). We must therefore clearly identify\nthe stars that will guide us on that voyage. It is in those\nstars that Uruguay believes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This constitutes a recognition not only of his\noutstanding ability and merits, but also of the brotherly\ncountry of Uruguay, whose well-known international\ncalling makes it an outstanding Member and\nrepresentative of Latin America in this important\ninternational body.\nWe are also grateful to his illustrious predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his efforts to contribute to\nthe Organization\u00e2s modernization.\nAt the end of June, during the absence of the\nPresident of the General Assembly, Panama, as Vice-\nPresident, occupied the presidency of the General\nAssembly and had the honour of cooperating in the\nadoption of important measures on science, technology\nand computers.\nOur gratitude goes also to the seventh Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, with the long experience\nhe has gained over more than 30 years devoted to the\nOrganization, is promoting reforms that will be of great\nbenefit to the United Nations.\n18\n\n\nOn Security Council reform, we endorse the\nrecommendation of the Open-ended Working Group on the\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\nRelated to the Security Council that consideration of this\nitem should continue during the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly on the basis of the work carried out in\nprevious sessions.\nPanama recalls with gratitude that the holding of a\nSecurity Council meeting in Panama a quarter of a century\nago and the support of the international community were\nextremely valuable to the Panamanian people in the\nfulfilment of its aspirations regarding the Canal.\nPanama attaches great importance to discussions\nrelating to economic issues, particularly those addressing\nsustainable economic development in order to eradicate\npoverty. We feel that by improving our education, our\ncountries will better be able to focus on processes of\nreform, which must be undertaken gradually.\nWith regard to the globalization of the economy, the\nRepublic of Panama congratulates the Secretary-General for\nhaving held on the 17 and 18 September a high-level\ndialogue on the social and economic impact of globalization\nand the interdependence of its political consequences.\nPanama feels that the matters before the Fifth\nCommittee relating to the process of adopting the budget\nare of great importance to the Organization, and we hope\nthat Member States will faithfully comply with its\nsuggestions.\nMy delegation believes that we should give full\nsupport to measures that will persuade Member States to\npay on time and in full their obligations to the United\nNations.\nIn our judgment, the most important tasks to be\naccomplished in order to neutralize the present economic\ncrisis are the restoration of trust in the markets; the\nstabilization of the financial markets; the support of growth;\nallocation of the necessary means to the international\nfinancial institutions; and the immediate protection of the\nmost vulnerable.\nThe financial markets and their problems are of global\nscope, yet the governmental efforts to resolve those\nproblems have a strictly local range. This disparity is at the\nroot of many problems we are now facing.\nEconomic globalization makes it necessary to\nstrengthen the links of the United Nations with the World\nBank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nChildren\u00e2s Fund (UNICEF) and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank (IADB).\nThe need to create an even playing field in the\ninternational system for economic cooperation is urgent\nand justifies the major efforts ongoing within the United\nNations to restructure what has been called the\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153architecture\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the system.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u00e2s repeated calls\nfor more vigorous action towards some way of alleviating\nthe enormous debts that are suffocating many countries\nand that they simply cannot carry. It seems to us that\neconomic, social and environmental policy dimensions\nmust be integrated in such a way that none of them is\nsacrificed for the sake of the others.\nWe were deeply impressed by the wise counsel on\npoverty given to us yesterday by President Mandela.\nWe urge the Secretary-General and the community\nof the United Nations to continue our efforts to ensure\nthat the obvious benefits of globalization and its resultant\ninterdependence do not serve to make the rich richer and\nthe poor poorer. This could be done by establishing\nmechanisms that redirect part of the wealth generated to\nthe praiseworthy goals of creating more hospitals, more\nmodern schools and a higher standard of living for all\npeople.\nPanama has contributed to the cause of sustainable\neconomic development by complying with Agenda 21 and\nthe mandates of the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development. The concrete result of\nthis was the adoption of Law 41 of July 1998, an overall\nenvironmental law for the Republic of Panama, which\nestablishes the basic principles and regulations for\nprotecting, preserving and restoring the environment.\nAnother result is the preparation of an environmental\nstrategy for the country within the framework of a process\nin which the whole of Panamanian society is\nparticipating; actions are concerted, and each sector is\ncommitted to holding up its end.\nWe must have a clear vision of the future where\nanything related to the environment is concerned, and we\n19\n\n\nare sure that the Secretary-General will also make this clear\nin his plans for the future.\nPanama has followed with great interest the events\nrelating to peace in the Middle East and the problems of\nthe war-torn former Yugoslavia. We support the\ncomprehensive policy that must be pursued in Africa in\norder to move beyond the causes of conflict and promote\nlasting peace and sustainable development in the region.\nSimilarly, we have followed with great interest the\nSecretary-General\u00e2s efforts to advance the negotiations\ntowards just and lasting peace in Cyprus so that the\nunification process can quickly be consolidated. We see\nserious dangers in the situation in Afghanistan.\nAt the Conference in Rome, my country agreed with\nall that was said in favour of the establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court, and we are prepared, along\nwith other Member States in the General Assembly, to\nmake every effort necessary so that this court can bring to\njustice those who have committed serious crimes that are of\nconcern to the international community.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, we recall with\nrespect and admiration the work carried out by the great\nPanamanian internationalist Mr. Ricardo J. Alfaro, who was\ninstrumental in the drafting of this document that is so\nimportant to humanity.\nWe will always be attentive to the need for United\nNations programmes and policies to express the concern we\nfeel over the violations of human rights that still occur in\ncertain places.\nWith the establishment of its Ministry for Youth,\nWomen, Children and the Family, the Republic of Panama\nhas taken a very active part in protecting the rights of\nchildren in the workplace and is vigorously combating all\naspects of prostitution and child pornography. We therefore\napplaud the work being carried out by the Committee on\nthe Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and we\nnote with great satisfaction the effective work being done\nin this area by the Office of the First Lady of Panama.\nWe noted with concern the nuclear tests conducted by\nIndia and Pakistan, and condemned them at the time, since\nthey run counter to the principles of non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons. At the same time, we would like to see\nimplemented all the agreements included in the chemical\nand biological weapons conventions.\nPanama continues to take an interest in the ban on\nanti-personnel landmines, and we are ever vigilant to\nensure that our territory is free of these extremely\ndangerous mines.\nThe recent acts of terrorism in Africa and Europe are\nserious and unjustifiable crimes. They show clearly the\nneed to further strengthen the legal and political\nframework to combat this scourge. We share the concerns\nexpressed here yesterday regarding the dangers of\nterrorism.\nAs we stated at the recent Summit of Heads of State\nand Government of the Rio Group, which was held in our\ncountry, we reaffirm the importance of strengthening\ncooperation to combat terrorism at both the bilateral and\nmultilateral levels, with full respect for the sovereignty\nand jurisdiction of each State.\nInternationally, we reiterate our commitment to and\nsupport for efforts by the international community to\ncombat terrorism, since terrorist activities, whatever their\npurpose and motivation, are, in addition to being a\nviolation of human rights, immoral criminal acts, extreme\nacts of fanaticism that attack freedom, human life and the\ndevelopment of peoples.\nRegarding drug-trafficking, we are convinced that\nthe most effective way to make progress in combating\ndrugs would be to see it as a multilateral problem, always\nbearing in mind respect for the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of each country. Panama therefore firmly\nsupports the tasks and commitments established at the\ntwentieth special session of the General Assembly, which\nwas devoted to the common struggle against the world\ndrug problem, as well as the principles and\nresponsibilities established by the Organization of\nAmerican States in this matter.\nFrom 4 to 6 September, just a few days ago, a\nmeeting of the heads of State and Government of the Rio\nGroup was held in Panama, this year\u00e2s Secretariat of the\nRio Group, a consultative body for political harmony\ncomprising 14 Latin American countries. The Latin\nAmerican community is increasingly convinced that with\nsolid cooperation resulting from political consensus of the\nRio Group member States we can make greater strides at\nboth the national and international levels.\nThrough the annual meetings of the heads of State\nand Government and the Foreign Ministers of the region\nwe have established common objectives and\n20\n\n\ncommitments, which cover strengthening our democracies,\nquestions of international peace and security, drug-\ntrafficking, terrorism, human rights, combating poverty,\nsustainable development and international trade, as well as\nnew issues, such as the year 2000 computer problem and\nthe international financial crisis.\nAt the Rio Group meeting held in Quito in 1995, the\nRepublic of Panama offered its territory as the headquarters\nfor a forum where countries of the region could join in\nconsidering policies and measures aimed to eradicate\ntrafficking in narcotics and other illicit substances, as well\nas in coordinating anti-drug measures and training\nprogrammes, which effectively support our efforts to\ncombat drug-trafficking in the region.\nThe Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, meeting\nin our capital from 7 to 10 September 1997, clearly showed\nthe need for contact with the international maritime\ncommunity, the users and clients of the Canal, and\nconsidered creating an advisory board of the Canal\nAuthority, in order to make use of the experience and\nwisdom of men and women throughout the world.\nWe reiterate our pledge that the Panama Canal will\nalways be a public service, international in character and\nefficient and safe, without any form of discrimination. We\nare ready to assume full management of the Panama Canal\non 31 December 1999, thus consolidating our territory\nunder a single flag.\nThis is an appropriate occasion to reaffirm to the\ninternational community that after 31 December 1999\nPanama will never again renounce control of the Canal,\nwhich is in our territory; it will be a symbol of the\naspirations of many generations of Panamanians who have\nwanted this Canal to be an integral part of our territory in\na free, independent and sovereign nation.\nIn conclusion, I believe it is fitting to recall here the\nfollowing words of the President of Panama, Dr. Ernesto\nP\u00c3\u00a9rez Balladares, to our Legislative Assembly on 1\nSeptember:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wish to reiterate once again my commitment\nto democracy and my commitment to prepare for the\ntransfer of the Canal without exclusions and without\npolitical sectarianism. The elections on 2 May 1999\nwill determine who will lead the country into the\ntwenty-first century and who will close once and for\nall this historic era for our territory. For my part, I am\ncertain that on 1 September 1999 there will be a\nPresident and a Legislative Assembly elected\nthrough transparent and democratic elections; that\nour nation is now prepared to assume full control of\nthe Canal and its adjacent areas; and that, above all,\nthe country will be reconciled, in peace and prepared\nto enter the next millennium without the presence of\nforeign military bases and with a modern,\nprosperous economy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We therefore hope that the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Ad Hoc Committee\nof Seven on the Question of the Comorian Island of\nMayotte, presided over by His Excellency Mr. Omar\nBongo, President of the Republic of Gabon, will resume\nits work and re-establish the dialogue between the\nComoros and France on this question.\nFinally, we appeal to the wisdom and goodwill\nbeyond our continent, so that the Comoros can return\nonce and for all to the path of peace, security and hope.\nI should like solemnly to appeal to this Assembly for\nassistance to my country so that a solution to the problem\ncaused by its dismemberment can be found and my\ncountry can enter the twenty-first century as a reunited\ncountry.\nThe people, Government and head of State whom I\nam honoured and privileged to represent here today would\nlike to express, through my delegation, their gratitude and\nacknowledgement to the Secretary-General of our\nuniversal Organization for the clarity and lucidity of his\nanalysis of the causes of conflict on the African continent\nand for his courageous initiatives in the search for peace\nand sustainable development in Africa and throughout the\nworld. In this context, we urge the United Nations system\nand its specialized agencies to do all in their power to\nensure the rapid and complete implementation of all of\nthe recommendations provided by the Secretary-General\nin his report to the Security Council which he presented\nlast April.\n4\n\n\nMy Government urgently appeals to the international\ncommunity for cooperation to effectively combat terrorism\nin all its forms. Only international determination, with\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, will\nmake it possible to put an end to horrendous terrorist acts.\nTerrorism spares no part of the world and no stratum of\nsociety. Who can forget the murderous acts committed this\nsummer in Omagh, Ireland; Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam;\nCape Town, South Africa; and Luxor, Egypt? For our part,\nmy Government is cooperating openly and fully with the\nAmerican authorities to shed light on the suspected\nparticipation of a national of my country in the abhorrent\ncrimes committed in East Africa.\nSince my country is a telling example of the hotbeds\nof tension which are now mobilizing the resources of the\ninternational community, I should like to recall that for a\nyear and a half now the Organization of African Unity has\ntaken up \u2014 in close cooperation with the League of Arab\nStates, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and,\nvery recently, the Non-Aligned Movement \u2014 the separatist\ncrisis on the Comorian island of Anjouan and the links to\nbe established with the dismemberment of our archipelago\nState by the island of Mayotte\u2019s continuing to be under\nforeign administration.\nThe efforts and commitments of the Secretary-General\nof the OAU, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and his Special\nEnvoys, Ambassador Pierre Y\u00e9r\u00e9 and Mr. Mamoudou Kane,\nsince the beginning of the crisis, as well as the efforts of\nthe Governments involved in regional coordination to\nresolve the crisis in the Comoros, namely, Kenya, Tanzania,\nMozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius and the\nSeychelles, have been recognized and deserve admiration\nand support.\nMy country\u2019s people, Government and head of State\nwould like to convey through my delegation to the entire\ninternational community their commitment to peace and\nunity and reconciliation between the community of islands\nwhich make up the nation of the Comoros.\nSpecial mention should be made here of the most\nrespected statesman of our world, President Nelson\nMandela, who, in his dual capacity as head of State\nentrusted with regional coordination to resolve the crisis in\nthe Comoros, mandated by the OAU, and Chairman of the\nNon-Aligned Movement, has agreed to bring to bear his full\nauthority and his personal prestige throughout the world to\ncall upon the parties in conflict in the Comoros to conclude\na peace of the brave, in which there is neither victor nor\nvanquished, peace brought about for the greatest possible\nbenefit of the inhabitants of our archipelago State.\nIn the light of the claims and the rights\nacknowledged by our institutions, traditions, conventions\nand customs in a multi-island society, El Hadj Mohamed\nTaki Abdoulkarim, President of the Islamic Federal\nRepublic of the Comoros, declared after the OAU summit\nin Ouagadougo, and again recently in Durban during the\nNAM summit, that he was ready to work in a spirit of\nopenness and reconciliation for greater decentralization\nand autonomy for each of the four islands making up our\narchipelago State. Thus each of our islands will be able\nto elect a governor and a local legislative assembly to\ndeal with all matters relating to the immediate and\nparticular concerns of each of our communities of the\nislands of the archipelago State. An inter-island\ncommission will work for the equitable and proportional\ndistribution of the international community\u2019s resources\nand investments.\nHere I quote what El Hadj Mohamed Taki\nAbdoulkarim has rightly said, as follows:\n\u201cThis is an issue of bringing the administration\ncloser to its subjects, promoting the responsibility\nwithin a single citizenry and restoring the federal\nbodies of a united State their fundamental roles of\norganization, arbitration and the management of\ninternational sovereignty.\n\u201cThe future of our country will only be ensured\nwhen all opinions and all trends, in an atmosphere\nof greater tolerance, are accepted and fulfilled.\u201d\n(spoke in Arabic)\n\u201cThus have We made of you\nAn Unmat justly balanced.\nThat ye might be witnesses\nOver the nations,\nAnd the Messenger a witness\nOver yourselves\u201d.

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of\nYemen, I have great pleasure in expressing to Mr. Opertti\n38\n\n\nour heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of\nthe present session of the General Assembly. We are\nconfident that his competence and experience will enable\nhim to guide the session\u00e2s deliberations and achieve its\nobjectives.\nAt the same time, I should like to express our\nrecognition of the good offices of Mr. Kofi Annan,\nSecretary-General of the Organization, and of his great\nsuccess in serving peace within the framework of\npreventive diplomacy in order to defuse international crises\nbefore they flare up and to protect innocent victims. I also\nhave great pleasure in noting the intellectual and\norganizational efforts that are being made to revitalize\nUnited Nations activities in order to keep abreast of\ndevelopments at the end of the present century and meet\nthe demands of the next. We wish Mr. Annan every success\nin carrying out his future tasks.\nThe Republic of Yemen, its Government and people,\nhas made consistent endeavours to strengthen democratic\npractices based on political pluralism, freedom of the press,\nguarantees of public freedom and the protection of human\nrights.\nThe Republic of Yemen has realized the vital\nimportance of carrying out political, economic, financial\nand administrative reforms, together with a programme of\nstabilization and restructuring. When the due historical\nprocess brought about the unity of the country, Yemen\ninherited two political and economic systems based on\ndifferent organizational, cultural and ideological structures.\nThe Republic of Yemen, which represents the united\nYemen, has therefore launched a process of radical political\nand institutional reform intended to bring about national,\nsocial and political integration, making democratic practices\nmore deeply entrenched and increasing society\u00e2s\nparticipation in the political decision-making process. This\nincludes increasing the social role of Yemeni women,\nliberating them from all constraints on their participation\nand encouraging their integration in development.\nNaturally, bringing about economic and administrative\nreforms based on an open and liberal economy, free trade\nand the increased participation of the private sector requires\nnew legal and administrative mechanisms which may have\na negative impact on segments of society with limited\nincome and on the unemployed. Undoubtedly, this provides\nan incentive for the provision of assistance for all the\ncountries engaged in this experience, including Yemen, in\norder to achieve the concrete economic and financial results\nthat can alleviate the negative impact of such changes on\nthe social sectors that are unable to respond to the process\nof economic and financial adjustment and appropriate\nrestructuring in a natural and appropriate way. That is\nwhy it is imperative for the economic reform process to\nbe accompanied by a social safety net to ensure social\nand economic equilibrium and alleviate the impact of\nchange affecting the poor, unemployed and limited-\nincome groups, with regard to their simple lives and\nsubsistence existence.\nThis is a task which makes it incumbent upon the\ninternational financial institutions to recognize their\nresponsibilities in those areas and to intensify their\ndevelopment programmes with social, demographic and\nenvironmental dimensions. The flow of investments and\nassistance from rich countries to the less developed\ncountries have to be increased in order to bridge the\nstructural gap and enable our society to integrate and\nincrease its positive partnership in sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe world today is based on integration and\ncomplementarity. It aspires to globalization based on free\ntrade, free exchange and open markets. However, these\ncan only be achieved by regional cooperation of\ngovernment and private sectors of the countries of each\nregion. Thus our transition to globalization can be\nachieved through the bridges of regional cooperation,\nenabling us to make gains and achieve the common\ninterests of our peoples without disregarding specificities\nor neglecting elements of harmony and regional\nintegration. This approach would undoubtedly help in\nmaking concrete the spirit of fraternity, interdependence\nand integration, and would provide an opportunity to\nensure that the fundamental factors for peace and\nacceptable coexistence exist, with respect to all regional\nparties, which will assist in ensuring a balanced and\ncomprehensive world peace.\nIn this context, we demand that help and assistance\nbe provided to the developing countries and the least\ndeveloped countries, in order to enable them to minimize\nthe negative impact of the globalization of the world\neconomy on their national economies and to achieve\nlevels enabling them to participate with the developed\ncountries through competitiveness in producing high\nquality commodities at competitive prices. This could be\naccomplished once they have made reasonable progress in\nthe context of regional integration.\nDemocracy, social justice, human rights, economic\nand political reforms and serious regional cooperation can\n39\n\n\nonly be achieved when there is peace, stability and full\nsecurity. Today, given the unstable nature of peace in our\nregion, we are again apprehensive lest the situation explode.\nThis is due to Israeli intransigence and continuous disregard\nof the resolutions of international legitimacy. It is also due\nnot only to the Netanyahu Administration\u00e2s continued\nrejection of international resolutions obliging Israel to\nwithdraw from the Palestinian occupied territories, the\noccupied Golan Heights and South Lebanon, but also of the\nundertakings of the previous Administration of the late\nYitzhak Rabin at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo\naccords.\nThe current construction of new settlements; the\nchanging of the historical heritage of East Jerusalem,\nincluding the attempts to obliterate its Arab identity; the\nchanging of historical realities and demography: all this\ntestifies to the present Israel Government\u00e2s flagrant\nobstinacy and arrogance. We therefore demand that these\npractices, which present further obstacles to the peace\nprocess, be halted forthwith.\nIn order to prevent the region being plunged back into\nthe cycle of conflict, tension and bloodshed, we appeal to\nthe international community to take the necessary measures\nto compel Israel to honour its international obligations,\npursuant to the resolutions of international legitimacy and\nall other relevant obligations and agreements.\nIt has become clear that the policy of starvation,\ndeprivation and economic sanctions imposed on States,\nwhether individually or collectively, is of no avail as an\neffective means to the realization of certain political goals,\nespecially in an era in which freedom, democracy, and\nenhanced respect for human rights and the right to self-\ndetermination are reaffirmed. Consequently, the victims of\nthis policy are the most vulnerable sectors of the targeted\nStates. That is why we must reconsider the policy of\nimposing sanctions, and must reassess their impact,\nreaffirming the importance of humanitarian values and\nensuring that the real interests of peoples are not arbitrarily\nviolated or threatened for reasons of which these peoples\nare innocent. As we have already said, sanctions are no\nlonger a useful tool for the realization of political\nobjectives. We must engage in peaceful dialogue, and\ndefine a time framework and agreed criteria for the\nsanctions before they are imposed and put into effect. We\nmust also ensure that the people and the poorest social\nsectors are not the first and direct victims, as is currently\nthe case in Iraq and Libya.\nWhile reaffirming respect for international\nresolutions, we reiterate the need to lift the sanctions from\nIraq and Libya. These have caused serious damage and\nsevere human suffering in these fraternal countries.\nChildren, old people and women have been particularly\naffected.\nTerrorism has become an international phenomenon,\nand its effects and repercussions are not confined to any\none country, people or ideology. It concerns all nations\nand peoples, and there is a pressing need for the\ninternational community to respond immediately to the\ndemand to establish a political, intellectual and\ninstitutional system at the international and regional levels\nin order to combat it and eradicate the causes of this\nuncivilized and inhuman phenomenon, and to deal with its\nnegative consequences.\nIn this regard, the Republic of Yemen has absolutely\nrejected all forms of terrorism. Yemen shares the feelings\nof every member of the international community: fear and\nconcern at the continuation and increase of this anti-\ncivilizational phenomenon which goes counter to all\nhuman values. We therefore call for genuine cooperation\nto combat this phenomenon collectively and responsibly.\nMy country pays particular attention to developments\nin fraternal Somalia. We hope that the international\ncommunity will help to resolve the conflict between the\nvarious warring factions and political groupings. But at\nthe same time we would like to remind our brothers in\nSomalia that there can be no solution without the\ncooperation of the Somalis themselves primarily with\nregard to the solutions offered to them from abroad.\nOur concern for the situation in Somalia is a result\nof our feelings of fraternal responsibility, in addition to\nbeing a duty dictated by neighbourliness, especially since\nwe are the only country in the region that has received\nwaves of refugees from Somalia and other countries\nfleeing either national conflicts or purely economic\ncircumstances. The Republic of Yemen has paid a high\nprice and has sustained heavy suffering for its proximity\nto the Horn of Africa.\nOur modest potentialities are not adequate to deal\nwith this human influx into our country. We already have\ndifficulty meeting the needs of our own population. The\nrefugees have exacerbated our difficulties, and represent\nan intolerable economic and social burden. The provisions\nmade by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees are insufficient to meet the\n40\n\n\nneeds of the refugees in our country. We therefore request\nthe international community to provide us forthwith with\nassistance in carrying out our humanitarian responsibilities\ntowards our refugee brothers. We further call upon all\nparties in the Horn of Africa and the concerned Arab\nparties to cooperate in reaching realistic solutions to this\nprotracted crisis.\nMany years have elapsed since the issue of reforming\nthe United Nations was first raised, especially with regard\nto equitable geographical representation on the Security\nCouncil and the formulation of criteria to limit the coercive\nuse of the veto. We fully support the call for the application\nof democratic norms in and universal representation on the\nCouncil in order to reflect the growth of the membership of\nthe General Assembly since the 1950s and the major\ndevelopments since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of\nthe cold war and the expansion of the horizons of\nglobalization \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all of which make it imperative to reform\nthe Security Council. It is a pressing need that must be\nanswered if justice and democracy in international relations\nare to be achieved, in conformity with the increased\ncontacts and improved relations between peoples.\nWe therefore support the Open-ended Working Group\nset up for this purpose. We appreciate what has been\nachieved within the framework of its mandate, pursuant to\nthe resolution of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly in 1993. We also appreciate the cooperation\ndemonstrated by this Working Group. We call for the\ncontinuation of its work in order to fulfil its mandate at an\nearly date.\nIt is incumbent upon us to cooperate in creating an\nappropriate atmosphere for the establishment of a new\ninternational order based on justice, freedom of choice and\ntolerance. It is our responsibility to work together for\nhumanity and its prosperity, and to draw ever closer to our\nobjective to live as neighbours on the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by joining\nprevious speakers in extending my personal congratulations\nand those of my delegation to you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. You assume the leadership of this Assembly at a\ntime when the global agenda demands much of us all. I\nassure you of the full support and cooperation of the\nJamaican delegation as you guide the work of this\nAssembly to what I am confident will be a successful\nconclusion.\nI wish also to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine for the effective manner in which he discharged\nhis responsibilities as President of the Assembly during\nhis tenure.\nThe Secretary-General deserves our praise for his\noutstanding leadership of the Organization during the past\nyear. I congratulate him in particular on the successes\nachieved through the quiet methods of preventive\ndiplomacy which he employed on sensitive issues\naffecting international peace and security.\nWe welcome his report, which contains a thoughtful\noverview of the complex challenges facing the\ninternational community, and we applaud the institutional\nreforms thus far introduced, which have sought to bring\ngreater coherence and efficiency to the work of the\nUnited Nations. We also endorse the reorganization of the\nwork programme, which brings renewed focus to the\ninitiatives of central importance to the United Nations:\nthose in the areas of peace and security, development\ncooperation, social development and humanitarian affairs.\nWe consider it essential that the membership of the\nUnited Nations support the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral in the implementation of this programme of\nwork. Such support should be extended not only by\nendorsement of the range of activities being undertaken in\nfulfilment of our mandates, but also through the regular\ncommitment of resources for their execution.\nOur presence here is an acknowledgement of the\nuniversality of many of the problems we face, and our\nmembership in this Organization is a demonstration of our\nconviction that these problems are best solved through\ncollective action. This should lead us to reaffirm our\nsupport for multilateralism and our respect for its\nprocesses through the timely payment, without\npreconditions, of our assessed contributions to the\nrespective United Nations bodies.\nIn recent years, the international community has\nwitnessed a disturbing increase in the number of conflicts\nwithin and between States. The stable peace anticipated\nat the end of the cold war has been elusive. Instead, we\nhave watched as efforts to resolve ongoing regional\ndisputes unravel because of obduracy, mistrust and\nhostility. We have watched as intolerance and hatred have\n3\n\n\ndivided communities and fuelled conflicts across the\ncontinents. We are concerned that despite the intervention\nof the Secretary-General, his envoys and the membership of\nthe United Nations, there is still no real progress towards\npeace in a number of long-standing disputes.\nWe share the international community\u2019s concern that\nthe peace process in the Middle East has been stalled, and\nwe are disappointed that there is still no substantial progress\non the long-standing problem in Cyprus. Hostilities in\nAfghanistan continue unabated, civil wars still rage in the\nSudan and Angola and violence in Kosovo has escalated.\nNew complications have arisen to increase instability and\nconflict in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.\nThese unresolved conflicts undermine the political,\neconomic and social fabric of the States concerned,\nbringing destruction and untold human suffering to the\nvictims of war. We cannot afford to drift into complacency\nwhile increasing numbers of the world\u2019s people are\ndestroyed, dispossessed and despoiled by war. In the face\nof this, we should strengthen our resolve to stand against\naggression and the use of force, and to support the\nresolution of disputes and conflicts through negotiated\nsettlements.\nWe encourage Member States to support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative for strengthening the\ncapability of the United Nations to deal with conflict\nresolution, prevention and early warning. I also wish to use\nthis opportunity to commend the United Nations\npeacekeeping forces for the great contribution which they\ncontinue to make to the maintenance of peace,\nnotwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which they\nwork.\nWe are deeply distressed at the increasing acts of\nviolence directed against international peacekeeping\npersonnel. I wish to pay special tribute to these volunteers,\nsome of whom have given their lives, for their sacrifice in\nthe cause of peace.\nThe Charter of the United Nations invests in the\nSecurity Council the principal authority for multilateral\ndecision-making in matters affecting international peace and\nsecurity. We are therefore concerned at the tendency of\nStates to take unilateral action which they deem to be in\ntheir national interest in situations of conflict with other\nnations. Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the principle of\ncollective security, on which the role of the Security\nCouncil is predicated.\nIt is also important that the actions of the Council\ninspire confidence and that there be greater openness and\ntransparency in its working methods. We believe that, like\nany other international body, the Security Council should\nundergo a process of democratic reform if it is effectively\nto meet the new challenges of an ever changing world.\nWe are committed to working as equal partners with\nthe rest of the international community to strengthen the\ncapacity of the Security Council to respond to the needs\nof Member States in matters of peace and security. To\nthat end, my Government has presented its candidature\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period\n2000-2001.\nMy Government attaches importance to the fact that\nthe long awaited International Criminal Court, which the\nSecretary-General described as the missing link in the\ninternational legal system, has now been constituted by an\ninternationally agreed Statute. We commend the\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago for taking the\ninitiative in calling for its establishment. That institution\nwill provide a framework for the legal expression of\ninternational opposition to the terrible crimes being\nperpetrated against humanity which the United Nations\nhad not been able to address effectively.\nThis year the international community celebrates the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. As we commemorate this important\nmilestone, we should affirm our commitment to the ideals\nof tolerance, peace and understanding for all peoples. Let\nus also demonstrate mutual respect for each other\u2019s right\nto self-determination, including the right to choose one\u2019s\nown path for achieving national goals, and the right to\nsustainable development.\nThere can be no doubt that peace and security are\nprerequisites for the attainment of sustainable\ndevelopment. It is equally true, however, that where there\nis economic and social deprivation, there can be no real\npeace.\nJamaica therefore strongly endorses the right to\ndevelopment as an integral part of fundamental human\nrights and underscores the important contribution which\nrealization of this right would make to the fuller\nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In\nthis regard, we welcome the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on progress being made in the elaboration of a\nstrategy for the implementation and promotion of the right\nto development.\n4\n\n\nWe continue to look to the United Nations system for\nsupport of our development agenda, which goes beyond our\neffort to gain fair access to international markets and to\nsecure a just and equitable share of global prosperity.\nCentral to improving the welfare of our people must\nbe measures to alleviate and ultimately eradicate poverty\nand to promote environmental protection and sustainable\ndevelopment. We need to strengthen our institutional\nframework for capacity-building and we need to invest in\ndevelopment of our human resources.\nThis is our people-centred vision for development, and\nwe recognize the need, if we are to make a reality of this\nvision, to continue to devise and implement public policies\nwhich ensure that the gains from economic growth and\ndevelopment are equitably distributed throughout society.\nThis challenge of good governance demands an\ninstitutional infrastructure that promotes transparency and\naccountability in public administration, ensures the effective\nmanagement of fiscal and monetary policies and protects\nthe integrity of judicial and law enforcement systems.\nA crucial component of our economic and social\ntransformation is the development of our human resources.\nJamaica supports the view that sustainable development\ncannot be achieved without sustained human development.\nIndeed, the pivotal importance of our human resources to\nthe development process was reaffirmed by the Caribbean\nCommunity member States in the Montego Bay Declaration\nadopted in 1997.\nWe in the Caribbean region stand firmly committed to,\nfirst, nurturingthe development of each person\u2019s potential\nwithout regard to gender; secondly, developing a culture of\nentrepreneurship; thirdly, research and development as a\nway of life and a means of improving production; and\nfinally, improving the competitiveness of those industries\non which our economies are based. We look to the\ninternational community to support these aspirations.\nIn this regard, Jamaica welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposed initiatives to strengthen the international\nframework for human development. We agree that it would\nbe useful to convene global and regional seminars exploring\nways to advance human resource development and\ninstitution-building in preparation for the Millennium\nAssembly to be held in the year 2000.\nThe issue of sustainable development for small island\ndeveloping States is of particular importance to Jamaica. It\nspeaks to the very survival of a group of island States\nwhose economic viability and developmental aspirations\nare inextricably linked to the carrying capacity of the\nfragile ecosystems in which these nations make their\nhome. I speak of the ecologically vulnerable islands and\nlow-lying coastal States of the Caribbean, which are\ncontinually subject to the pressures of urbanization and\nresource exploitation, to the pollution of their coastal\nwaters and to the threat of natural disasters. We are\nendangered by the threat of sea-level rise and face the\ndestruction of our coral reefs.\nThe danger posed by natural disasters was most\nrecently demonstrated by hurricane Georges, which\nwreaked destruction through the Caribbean, causing\nwidespread loss of life and property in Antigua and\nBarbuda, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti\nand Saint Kitts and Nevis. We take this opportunity to\nappeal to the international community to provide urgent\nand generous humanitarian assistance and support for the\nreconstruction of our sister Caribbean States. Jamaica\nwelcomes the ongoing effort of the United Nations to\ndevelop economic and ecological vulnerability indices for\nsmall island developing States and will be monitoring\nclosely the outcome of this work.\nThe success of the small island developing States\ninitiative will depend on the negotiation of favourable\nagreements among national stakeholders and on the\nforging of effective partnerships with donor countries.\nJamaica therefore looks forward to the convening of the\nspecial session for the review of the Global Conference\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States in 1999, which provides an opportunity\nfor real progress to be made through the commitment of\nfinancial resources. What we need now is an action-\noriented follow-up programme to take our economies into\nthe twenty-first century.\nJamaica is a strong advocate of multilateralism and\nbelieves that measures available within the multilateral\nframework should be employed to assist developing\ncountries to benefit meaningfully from the process of\nglobalization. We note that while this process holds much\npromise for growth and prosperity, it also poses serious\nchallenges for developing countries, many of which are\nbeing increasingly marginalized. The reality is that the\nglobalization process is heightening patterns of uneven\ndevelopment among developed and developing countries,\nand it is already very clear that there is no globalization\nof benefits.\n5\n\n\nThe plight of developing countries in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis currently affecting the global economy is\nmade even grimmer when we take into account the decline\nin concessionary financial flows from the donor community\nwhich we have witnessed in recent years. Official\ndevelopment assistance represents today only an average of\n0.22 per cent of the gross national product of developed\ncountries, a far cry from the target of 0.7 per cent set in\n1972. The share of official development assistance in net\nresource flows to developing countries fell from 64 per cent\nin 1994 to 22 per cent in 1996.\nTaken with the heavy burden of the debt-service\npayments which must be met, we are faced with the\nunhappy circumstance of net reverse flows from the South\nto the North at a time when additional resources are needed\nto address the challenges which attend the globalization\nprocess.\nThese trends must be reversed if developing countries\nare to have a fair opportunity to achieve meaningful\ndevelopment; for the success of the development process is\ndependent on the availability of external financing, and\nconcessionary resource flows play a significant role in the\nmaintenance of economic stability, the development of\ninfrastructure and capacity-building, which are prerequisites\nfor effective participation in the globalization process.\nJamaica considers that the time has come for us to\naddress these issues in serious dialogue. There is an urgent\nneed to identify ways in which development financing from\nindustrialized to developing and transition economies for\nboth public and private sector enterprise may be increased.\nWe must explore measures to relieve the external debt of\nthe developing countries, including the cancellation of debt.\nWe should seek to have dialogues between creditor and\ndebtor countries to ensure an increase in the flow of\nconcessionary financing in support of economic reforms,\npoverty eradication and the achievement of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWe therefore join the call for the urgent convening of\na conference on financing for development at an early date.\nCrucial issues which we would wish to see discussed at\nsuch a meeting are strategies for mobilizing domestic\nresources for development; mobilization of international\nprivate financial flows; international financial cooperation\nfor development; debt relief; and trade facilitation for\ndevelopment.\nBeyond this proposed conference, my Government\nrecognizes that there is a need for ongoing exchange\nbetween the North and the South. While the days of the\nideological divide and political polarization are behind us,\nwe are still faced with the challenge of North-South\ndisparity in development and opportunity. We need to\nfoster increased collaboration between the developed and\nthe developing world to identify ways in which wider\ncooperation on issues concerning trade and investment,\ndebt and development may be pursued.\nWe consider that a process of dialogue on these\nissues could be initiated by a representative group of\ndeveloping and transition economies in consultation with\nthe major industrialized countries. We believe that such\na process of dialogue would pave the way for a broader\nframework of functional cooperation in areas of interest\nto both North and South.\nIt is with much satisfaction that Jamaica assumes the\nchairmanship of the Group of 15 developing States, and\nwe look forward to hosting the ninth ministerial meeting\nin Jamaica in February next year. Jamaica, during its\ntenure, will seek to ensure that developing countries play\na more active role in shaping the international economy\nso as to promote greater balance and equity.\nMy Government remains deeply concerned at the\never expanding illicit drug trade, which is not only a\nmenace to civil society, but also undermines the economic\nviability of our countries. The extraordinary demand for\nand supply of illicit drugs for this lucrative trade has\nresulted in the formation of transnational networks,\nincluding highly sophisticated money-laundering\noperations. Of even greater concern is the now well-\nestablished link between the drug trade and the\nproliferation of small arms. The ready availability of\nsmall arms has intensified the cycle of crime and violence\nin our societies.\nThe special session of the General Assembly on the\nworld drug problem, held earlier this year, underscored\nthe need to strengthen the process of bilateral, regional\nand international cooperation in the fight against illicit\ndrug activities. These initiatives should also deal\nsimultaneously with the related problem of small arms.\nJamaica calls on the international community to fully\nsupport these efforts.\nJamaica joins in condemning the acts of terrorism\ncommitted in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi during August.\nWe support the adoption of a multilateral approach as the\nmost effective means of removing this threat to the\nsecurity of the international community.\n6\n\n\nCaribbean States recognize the ocean as a symbol of\nthe common heritage of mankind, a vital resource which\nshould be managed in a responsible manner so as to ensure\nits continued use for present and future generations.\nCaribbean Governments are committed to the protection of\nthe Caribbean Sea, our shared patrimony. We have recently\ntaken a decision to develop and implement a comprehensive\ncoastal zone management programme by the year 2000. We\ncontinue to be concerned at the threat tothe fragile marine\nenvironment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and\nother hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea.\nJamaica commends the Government of Portugal for its\ninitiative in establishing the Independent World\nCommission on the Oceans, on which an eminent Jamaican\nserves. As part of its recognition of the International Year\nof the Ocean, the Government of Jamaica has established\na National Council on Ocean and Coastal Zone\nManagement to promote the sustainable development and\nuse of our marine resources.\nThe International Seabed Authority, which has its\nheadquarters in Kingston, continues to make progress on\nthe negotiation of a mining code. It is hoped that these\nnegotiations will be finalized at an early date, so that a\nregulatory regime for the resources of the seabed may be\nfirmly established. We call on Member States to participate\nmore actively in these negotiations in order to ensure that\nthe code which is developed will protect the interests of all\ncountries. We also urge Member States to support the\noperation of the Authority through the commitment of\nresources.\nIt has not escaped our attention that many of the\npreceding speakers have made reference to the need for the\npromotion of international peace, human security and\nsustainable development. As we move forward towards the\nend of an era, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that\nwe do not face the dawn of the new millennium burdened\nby the weight of unresolved issues which impede the\ndevelopment of our community of nations and which\nundermine the well-being of our peoples.\nClearly, it is in our individual and collective interest\nto participate fully in the process for development and\npeace, for, after all, the character of the global village of\nthe future will ultimately be determined by the quality of\nthe input that each of us invests today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. I am fully confident that his experience\nand skill will ensure the success of the work of this\nsession.\nThe world continues to labour under events that attest\nto the inability of the international community to avert the\neffects of international transformations which carry within\nthem the elements of tension and conflict, given the\nimbalance at the international level caused by a unipolar\nsystem wherein a sole dominant player in the international\narena seeks to impose its hegemony on the international\ncommunity. That sole player is not concerned except with\nits selfish and narrow interests, and with imposing its\ndominance over international institutions and\norganizations. As a result, the United Nations faces a\nserious challenge represented by the degree of its ability\nto regain the balance required of it in order to accomplish\nits objectives as set forth in the Charter.\nIn this context, the United Nations witnesses\nattempts to reform its structures and work mechanism to\nmake it compatible with the current political and\neconomic realities. Most important is the effort to reform\nthe working methods of the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council in order to bring the work of these two\norgans into full harmony with the evolution of\ninternational relations and with the increased membership\nof the international Organization. This evolution requires\nequitable representation of States from the various\ncontinents on the Security Council, whether through\npermanent or non-permanent membership. The success of\nthese efforts depends largely on the serious political will\nof Member States of our Organization. The reform of the\nwork of the Security Council is urgently needed, if we are\nto end control over it by a few States and transform it\ninto an institution which truly represents international\nrealities. Without these reforms, it is impossible to\nachieve the purposes and the principles of the Charter\nwith regard to the maintenance of peace and security,\npromoting economic and social development and\nstrengthening cooperation among people.\n13\n\n\nInternational peace and security are affected by the\nirrational and biased character of the way issues of\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, are\naddressed. There are States which maintain huge arsenals\nof weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear,\nchemical, biological or long-range missiles, while other\nStates are being disarmed or called upon to disarm\nthemselves under all sorts of pretexts. The proper approach\nin this regard is in the comprehensive implementation of\nthe relevant international treaties and comprehensive\nagreements, free of selectivity and discrimination. Then,\nand only then, can the goal of general and complete\ndisarmament be put to the service of the cause of peace and\nsecurity in the world and of ensuring the legitimate rights\nof States to defend their security and independence in a just\nand equitable manner.\nThe Middle East region is witnessing today a grave\nsituation and serious impairment of the balance of powers.\nThe Zionist entity possesses a huge arsenal of weapons of\nmass destruction of all types \u2014 nuclear in particular,\nchemical, biological or long-range missiles \u2014 in disregard\nof the General Assembly\u2019s efforts to render the Middle East\na zone free of weapons from mass destruction; of Security\nCouncil resolution 487 (1981), which demands that the\nZionist entity place its installations under the\ncomprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency; and of paragraph 14 of Security Council\nresolution 687 (1991), which states that the actions to be\ntaken towards Iraq represent steps towards the goal of\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons of\nmass destruction. This situation, resulting from the Zionist\nentity\u2019s failure to comply with these resolutions, threatens\nsecurity and peace in the region and in the entire world,\nand encourages an arms race in the region.\nIraq strongly affirms its support for the struggle of the\nPalestinian people against Zionist settler colonialism in\nPalestine. It supports the struggle of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization for the realization of its legitimate objectives,\nendorsed by the international community, which affirms the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinians in Palestine, including\nits capital, Al-Quds al-Sharif.\nThe comprehensive, inhumane blockade imposed on\nIraq has entered its ninth year. This blockade has caused\nand continues to cause the death of thousands of Iraqi\ncitizens every month due to the lack of medicine and food\nand a grave deterioration in the infrastructures of the\nindustrial, agricultural, health, education, service sectors and\nother areas. This situation calls for the strong condemnation\nof those who insist, for ulterior political motives, on\ncontinuing to inflict on the Iraqi people this destructive\nblockade, the tragic consequences of which are\ntantamount to internationally proscribed acts of genocide.\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) contains two\nsets of obligations: those which must be fulfilled by Iraq,\nand those that require the Security Council to lift the\nblockade on Iraq when Iraq has met its obligations.\nThe obligations imposed on Iraq concern\ndisarmament. Briefly, they require the destruction,\nremoval or rendering harmless, under the supervision of\nthe United Nations Special Commission and the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, of all weapons of\nmass destruction which were in Iraq\u2019s possession. They\nenjoin Iraq to refrain from the production, possession,\nstockpiling, use or development of such weapons in the\nareas prohibited by resolution 687 (1991), which are the\nballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres\nand chemical and biological weapons, together with the\nnuclear programme. These obligations imposed on Iraq\nalso provide for the establishment of a system of ongoing\nmonitoring, verification and registration of compliance.\nIn return for the achievement of the above, with\nregard to the elimination of the prohibited weapons,\nparagraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) provides that the\nprohibition against the import of basic commodities and\nproducts originating in Iraq and the prohibition against\nfinancial transactions related thereto contained in Council\nresolution 661 (1990) shall cease to remain in effect.\nThroughout the past seven and one-half years, Iraq\nhas fully cooperated with the Security Council, the\nSpecial Commission and the International Atomic Energy\nAgency. Iraq has met all the conditions and obligations\nimposed on it as an expression of its good will and in\norder to have the blockade imposed on its people lifted.\nAll prohibited weapons have been destroyed over the\npast seven and one-half years, together with hundreds of\nplants, installations and equipment related to those\nweapons. The operations were carried out with so much\nvengefulness that they even included cooling and lighting\nequipment, as well furnishings and other items that had\nnothing to do with the prohibited weapons or with their\nproduction. Since 1994, the Special Commission and the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency have established a\ncomprehensive system of strict monitoring.\nHowever, although Iraq has fully implemented all\nthe requirements of resolution 687 (1991) concerning\n14\n\n\ndisarmament, the Security Council has not taken any action\nto implement its own obligations towards Iraq, as\nprescribed by paragraph 22 of that same resolution.\nQuestions which must be legitimately addressed to the\nSecurity Council are: why should Iraq bear all these\nburdens and losses while the blockade continues and no one\nknows when it is going to be lifted? Why has the Security\nCouncil been unable so far to discharge its obligations\ntowards Iraq?\nIraq has cooperated throughout the past seven and one\nhalf years with the Security Council, the Special\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\nand has met all the requirements of the Security Council\u2019s\nresolutions in the hope that its cooperation would lead to\nlifting the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq.\nHowever, the blockade has not yet been lifted, thus\nrendering the continuation of cooperation both meaningless\nand useless.\nThe Special Commission entrusted with pursuing the\nimplementation of Iraq\u2019s obligations under the provisions of\nresolution 687 (1991), which concerns disarmament and\ndirects the monitoring system established since 1994,\nrefrains \u2014 I repeat, refrains \u2014 from reporting the facts\nabout Iraq\u2019s compliance with its obligations under Security\nCouncil resolutions. The reason for its failure to do so is\npolitical. The Special Commission and its Chairman operate\nunder the influence of an arrogant, powerful State that is\npursuing ulterior political aims against Iraq that have no\nrelevance whatsoever to Security Council resolutions on\nIraq.\nFor political reasons, the Special Commission and its\nChairman refrain from reporting to the Council that Iraq is\ntotally free of all weapons prohibited under resolution 687\n(1991) in the three areas of missiles and chemical and\nbiological weapons, even though the Special Commission\nhas no concrete evidence to prove the opposite. The Special\nCommission and its Chairman both refrain from reporting\nto the Council that all the plants, equipment and\ninstallations which the Commission itself determined had\nanything to do with those weapons have been destroyed and\nthat the remaining plants, equipment and installations\ncapable of so-called dual-use are totally under a\ncomprehensive and strict monitoring system. Accordingly,\nIraq is incapable of resuming the production of such\nweapons. Finally, the Special Commission and its Chairman\nrefrain, also for political reasons, from reporting to the\nCouncil that since the establishment of the monitoring\nsystem in 1994 the Commission has not noted any violation\non the part of Iraq with regard to resuming the production\nof the prohibited weapons.\nThis prejudiced position on the part of the Special\nCommission and its Chairman has brought action to a\ndead end and into an unacceptable vicious circle. Iraq was\ntherefore obliged to suspend cooperation with the Special\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\nbecause insisting on dead-end paths and vicious circles\ncan only lead to the continuation of the blockade on the\npeople of Iraq, which is unacceptable and even contrary\nto resolution 687 (1991).\nIn order to seek a way out of this deadlock and\nbreak out of the vicious circle created by the Special\nCommission and its Chairman, Iraq has welcomed the\nproposal for a comprehensive review submitted by the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to the Security\nCouncil last 6 August. Iraq has emphasized that such a\ncomprehensive review is a legal and moral obligation\nwhich the Council is duty-bound to discharge. By the\nterms of resolution 687 (1991), the Council is required to\nimplement paragraph 22, relating to lifting the\nprohibitions against the import of basic commodities and\nproducts originating in Iraq, based upon the completion\nby Iraq of all actions contemplated in part C of the\nresolution. The Council is also required to undertake a\nreview every 60 days aimed at either reducing or lifting\nthe embargo in the light of the implementation by Iraq of\nall its obligations under the relevant Council resolutions.\nHowever, the 40 reviews carried out so far have been a\nmere formality, arbitrary and far from comprehensive.\nThus, embarking upon a real comprehensive review\nin accordance with the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal is not\na reward given to Iraq, but a duty that the Security\nCouncil has to undertake under its own resolutions. Iraq\nhas expressed its willingness to participate effectively in\nsuch a comprehensive review \u2014 it is one of its\ninalienable rights. Iraq has also expressed its hope that\nsuch a comprehensive review of what it has accomplished\nin terms of disarmament under part C of resolution 687\n(1991) will be made as soon as possible and without\nfurther delay. It is our hope that it will be indeed\ncomprehensive, fair and honest and that Iraq will be given\nevery possible opportunity to submit its point of view on\nall relevant questions that might be posed by the Special\nCommission, the IAEA or members of the Security\nCouncil. Iraq also hopes that the review will be conducted\nunder the personal supervision of the Secretary-General\nand that Mr. Annan will see to it that such a\ncomprehensive review is bound by a clearly defined\n15\n\n\ntimetable and not allow it to be an aimless process without\nforeseeable end.\nWhile we support carrying out such a comprehensive\nreview in an objective, fair and impartial manner, we affirm\nIraq\u2019s right to expect the Security Council to proceed to\ntake action to lift the inhumane sanctions that have been\nimposed on the people of Iraq for eight years now. The\npeople and leadership of Iraq will accept no less."

        "file_text": "I join other delegations in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your ability and\nexperience will successfully guide our work during this\nsession. I also wish to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nwhose presidency was characterized by energy and drive.\nFreedom first and foremost. That rallying cry has\ninspired peoples and nations throughout this century. It\ngave birth to brave acts of courage during two world\nconflicts. It gave sustenance in the struggle for\ndecolonization. It gave stamina and resilience during and\nafter the dark days of the cold war.\nFreedom first and foremost. That was the solid\nplatform on which citizens worldwide stood their ground\nwhenever authoritarian regimes sought to erode democracy,\nhuman rights and the rule of law.\nFreedom first and foremost. That ideal buttressed\nPresident Roosevelt in his effort to give birth to the\nUnited Nations.\nAs we strive to build a better world and struggle to\nconquer the uncertainties of our times, we the peoples of\nthe United Nations continue to cherish those four essential\nhuman freedoms identified by President Roosevelt in his\nspeech to Congress on 6 January 1941: freedom of speech\nand expression \u2014 everywhere in the world; freedom of\nevery person to worship God in his own way \u2014\neverywhere in the world; freedom from want to secure for\nevery nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants \u2014\neverywhere in the world; freedom from fear through a\nworldwide reduction of armaments so that no nation will\nbe in a position to commit an act of physical aggression\nagainst any neighbour \u2014 anywhere in the world.\nUnderlining these four freedoms, President Roosevelt\nstressed that they were \u201ca definite basis for a kind of\nworld attainable in our own time and generation\u201d, not a\n\u201cvision of a distant millennium\u201d.\nFor the past 53 sessions world leaders have gathered\nhere in this General Assembly to take stock of\nhumankind?s progress in achieving those noble aims for\nwhich the United Nations was founded. Each year brings\nwith it new unknowns, new challenges, new tragedies.\nYet each year we also see movement, in small steps or in\nstrides, towards a more secure world.\n\n\nBuilding a world where peace, justice and freedom\nreign supreme is a duty for all of us who serve in public\noffice. This responsibility becomes more onerous as we\nadvance towards the dawning of the new millennium.\nEight years ago I was privileged to serve this\nAssembly as its President. The future then beckoned. In\n1989 the world had witnessed the collapse of the Soviet\nbloc. Millions had reacquired their freedom. In 1990 the\nidyllic aftermath of the Bush-Gorbachev Malta summit was\nshattered by the invasion of Kuwait. In those times of\neuphoric uncertainty I called on Member States to revitalize\nthis General Assembly and ensure a symbiotic relationship\nbetween the Organization?s principal organs. The call for\nreform prevailed. It bore fruit and continues to give results.\nReform is essential for the Organization?s well-being.\nIt is even more essential for the future of humankind.\nEight years ago I signalled the danger of a curtain of\npoverty dividing the world, with the same dire\nconsequences as the Iron Curtain had on world peace and\nsecurity. That danger remains and has become more\npronounced.\nLast week the President of the United States reminded\nthis Assembly that \u201cthe gulf is widening between the\nworld?s haves and have-nots\u201d. (A/53/PV.7, p. 11)\nNarrowing that gulf is essential if we desire a secure global\nsociety bereft of rage. That rage often transforms itself into\nacts of violence.\nThe ill winds that blow at present, devastating the\neconomies of many States and crippling progress built\nthrough the hard work of so any families around the world,\nfurther aggravate this situation.\nThe United Nations is the unique instrument to\npromote and protect the universal enjoyment of human\ndignity. Significantly, one of the first tasks that this\nOrganization set itself was the drafting of a Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. In commemorating the\nfiftieth anniversary of its adoption by this Assembly, we\nrenew our commitment to its content. That document is not\noutdated, nor can it be easily replaced. It proclaims human\nrights that by their very nature are universal, inherent and\nindivisible.\nThe Declaration is comprehensive and demands an\nobservance that is equally comprehensive. A selective\napproach damages the Declaration and the wider concepts\nthat it represents. It undermines a vision of society in\nwhich respect for human rights is paramount and universal.\nThere is, however, a significant lack in this\nDeclaration. It is an instrument with no judicial\nmechanisms or sanctions. Has the time arrived to learn\nfrom the experience of the regional human rights\nconventions, in particular the European Convention,\nwhich through its mechanisms instituted the European\nCourt of Human Rights and through the right of\nindividual petition further guarantees a judicial process\naimed at ensuring effective enforcement?\nThere can be no freedom without democracy.\nEqually, there can be no democracy without the exercise\nof individual freedoms. We underscore this reaffirmation\nas we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe the peoples look up to United Nations for\nleadership in resolving the ills of our times. Yet we the\npeoples are the United Nations. The United Nations is us.\nAttempts to project or depict the United Nations as\nan entity alien to the rest of the international community\nor as an Organization that can determine or predetermine\nthe fate of peoples and society are both erroneous and\ndangerous. This Organization depends on a continuation\nof that balance of principles and institutions intrinsic in\nthe Charter. This balance is best conserved by\nconsolidating the process of consensus-building that has\nrendered so many positive results in the past half-century.\nImposition of the will of some over the will of the others\nis rarely conducive to harmony in any circumstance. It is\neven less so in a forum of sovereign nation States.\nThere are instances when the will of the majority\ntraces important paths for future cooperation between\nStates. Yet the effort to ensure the widest a priori\nadherence to the principles being negotiated is always\nessential, particularly if we desire such agreements to be\nuniversal in their application. This demands a diplomatic\nand political effort that may appear exasperating. Still, it\nis the path that best conserves the delicate balance\nbetween the sovereign rights of States and the emergence\nof a new world order.\nWe have partaken of the sorrow sown by violence\nand war. We have survived the tensions of bloc\nantagonism and nuclear proliferation. We have grappled\nwith the anguish of division and mutual suspicion. The\nimminence of a new millennium naturally generates hopes\n2\n\n\nand expectations. Foremost is the longing for the fulfilment\nof the promise garnered at the end of the cold war.\nThroughout this decade we committed ourselves, devising\ntools to deal with uncertainties as they emerged. Yet\nsuffering and strife continue to plague the planet.\nShocking violations imposed upon us the duty to\nprovide future generations with an international judicial\nmechanism to fairly establish the guilt of the perpetrators of\nwar crimes and provide for their punishment. We acted\nwith the swiftness demanded by the might of right. We set\nthe framework to deal with crimes that are an affront to\nhumanity?s sense of justice and compassion.\nIn Rome last July we adopted the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. We thus lay the foundation\nfor an effective and credible institution that in itself is a\ndeterrent against the commission of heinous crimes falling\nunder its jurisdiction. We hope that the momentum gathered\nin institution-building is retained to enable the Court to start\nfunctioning and effectively deal with crimes against\nhumanity whenever they occur.\nVigilance remains the order of the day. With good\nreason, the world proclaimed victory at the indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT). The ratification of the latter by two of the\nnuclear-weapon States is a welcome and positive step. Yet\npitted against these positive developments were recent\nnuclear tests carried out by two non-signatories. We have\nseen the partial dismantling of nuclear arsenals, but also\nwitnessed the dangers of proliferation. Such actions fuel\ninsecurity and mistrust. We join others in strongly urging\nthese two countries, and indeed all countries, to exercise\nrestraint. Nuclear testing is a stark reminder of the dangers\never present in nuclear weaponry.\nMalta welcomes the statements of intent made by the\nPrime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Assembly last\nweek. They augur well for the universality of the NPT\nregime. No effort must be spared to ensure universal\nadherence to and compliance with the relevant treaties\ncovering not only nuclear weapons but also all weapons of\nmass destruction. The nuclear disarmament agenda must be\nkept on track. The dangers that loom are not limited to the\npossession and use of such armaments by nuclear-weapon\nStates. The spectre of nuclear terrorism haunts us as we\ncombat illegal trafficking related to the possession,\nproduction and use of such weapons.\nThe dangers remain multiple. Chemical and\nbiological weapons pose destabilizing threats. By\ndisturbing contrast, technologies for their acquisition and\nuse are relatively easy to develop. Conventional arms-\ntrafficking also remains a major menace.\nThe establishment of the Organization for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) sets out a\nregime of control and verification that strikes a balance,\ncurbing proliferation of chemicals for weapons use while\nsanctioning beneficial use of chemicals by a wide range\nof industries. Malta is proud to have served on the\nExecutive Council in its initial stage.\nIt is our hope that the verification protocol on\nbiological weapons may likewise hamper, discourage and\ndisallow the use of biological components for war,\nconflict or conquest. Images of the maimed victims of\nlandmines buttress our commitment to outlaw these\nweapons. Malta was among the first to sign the Ottawa\nConvention, and ratification is being processed. We join\nothers in saluting its entry into force early next year. This\nbrings closer the prohibition on the use, stockpiling,\nproduction and transfer of anti-personnel mines and their\ndestruction.\nEqually threatening, intrusive and destabilizing are\ninternational crime, drug-trafficking and terrorism. These\ncontinue to poison the very roots of our societies,\nspreading corruption, fear and suffering. No Government\ncan ignore or shield itself from such phenomena.\nComplacency is both dangerous and unreal. United\nNations efforts to further international cooperation to\ncombat and curb these afflictions, particularly those of the\nVienna Centre for International Crime Prevention, deserve\nour full and unwavering support.\nFreedom, democracy and social justice have\nfortunately become oft-used terms within this\nOrganization. They are indeed the basic elements of all\nour efforts. They reflect the will to give substance to the\nCharter?s reaffirmation of fundamental human rights, the\ndignity and worth of the human person, and the equal\nrights of men and women and of nations large and small.\nCommitment to human rights must be matched by\naction to promote social justice and better living standards\nin larger freedom. The human rights that we promote and\nprotect must be complemented by the provision of a\nsocial safety net that preserves the dignity of all. This is\na principle that the Maltese people hold dear.\n3\n\n\nMy Government was again returned to office less than\nthree weeks ago. The cornerstone of our agenda is the\nrestoration of confidence and direction and the generation\nof wealth, to the benefit of all our people: our only and\nmost precious resource. This demands the resumption of a\nstrategy that invests in improving health and education\nservices with the same vigour with which we revolutionized\nthe social and economic infrastructures of our country. We\nare committed to social justice and thus to the well-being\nof those most vulnerable to suffering if left to their own\ndevices in times of economic transition. The true measure\nof progress remains social justice that buttresses equity and\npersonal dignity and ensures the universal enjoyment of\nfundamental human rights and freedoms.\nThe change in Administration has also brought about\nthe resumption of the march towards Europe which was\nbriefly frozen during the previous 22 months by the\nprevious Administration. Malta?s application for\nmembership of the European Union has been reactivated.\nAn overwhelming electoral mandate reconfirms the\nEuropean vocation of our people, repeatedly expressed in\nfree and fair elections during the past two decades. The\nchoice of our people is clear, and the path we shall follow\nis equally clear. Our immediate objective is to rejoin those\ncountries earmarked for the next enlargement of the Union.\nThough much remains to be done, the commitment of the\npeople and the Government is deep-seated.\nWe do not choose to be European. We are European:\nEuropean in history and culture, in economic structures and\npolitical organization, in security concerns and ethical\nvalues. Anchorage in the European Union is the natural\nculmination of our development process, our traditions and\nour culture. As in any other member of the Union, debate\non the benefits of membership and the consequent rights\nand responsibilities continues. This is an intrinsic aspect of\nthe democratic process. Nowhere in Europe have choices\nbeen easy or straightforward, but everywhere in Europe, the\nfreely expressed will of the people has prevailed. This is a\nfundamental characteristic of Europe, a political union built\non respect for the individual and the democratic will of its\npeoples.\nEnlargement of the European Union to gather peoples\nand nations within its fold in a spirit of pluralism, solidarity\nand cooperation is more than just a process. It cannot be\nseen as just an exercise in augmenting the membership. It\nis much more than that. It is a political demand for the\nrealization of the Union and its credibility in global politics.\nCharacterized by reciprocity, it is a quest in peace-building,\na venture that in less than half a century has continued to\ntransform the founding fathers? ideal into a tangible\nreality.\nLike all other Mediterranean States, Malta views the\nproblems of its region with particular concern. At the\ncrossroads of cultures and civilizations, the Mediterranean\nis disproportionately burdened with turmoil, tension and\nconflict. Resolution of each crisis demands positive action\nby the protagonists directly responsible. Yet the world\ncommunity can contribute, through its efforts and good\noffices, to constructing an environment conducive to\nnegotiated settlement. The bitter heritage of the past\nsometimes impedes that contact which is an essential first\nstep in the setting up of negotiating structures. In this\neffort to overcome obstacles, the international community\nand individual statesmen have given their fair share.\nThe open wounds that still afflict the region demand\nrenewed engagement lest they continue to fester and\ndegenerate into volatility that would risk spilling over to\nbroader areas.\nThe Cyprus question has long been one of these\nopen wounds, having political and stability repercussions\nthat go beyond the geographic dimensions of the island\nitself. A solution in conformity with the resolutions of the\nUnited Nations can have enduring positive effects for all\nthe parties concerned in the dispute.\nThe ever pervasive problems encountered by the\nMiddle East process are of particular concern. In spite of\nvarious efforts, this process has come to a virtual\nstandstill. We believe in the importance of revitalizing\nand respecting the commitments undertaken through and\nafter the Oslo peace accords. We urge all sides to respond\npositively to current initiatives aimed at restoring dialogue\nand hope.\nThe new millennium is the commemoration of the\nbirth of Jesus Christ, when the message that was brought\nto us was \u201cpeace on Earth\u201d. This is precisely the message\nthat is central to the initiative that will be debated during\nthis session, Bethlehem 2000. How sad it will be if the\nland of the nativity is still at war 2,000 years after that\nmessage.\nThe Euro-Mediterranean process was a significant\nstep in bringing together European and Mediterranean\ncountries comprehensively to address issues that still\nbeleaguer the region. The impasse in the Middle East has\ndealt a blow to the Euro-Mediterranean process. One\nhopes that this is but a temporary setback. Stability in the\n4\n\n\nMediterranean must rest on multiple initiatives that nurture\ncooperation through gradual confidence- and security-\nbuilding measures. This is the crux of our insistence on the\nneed to establish a stability pact for the region. Initiatives\nsuch as the addition of a parliamentary dimension to this\nprocess of dialogue, promoted by the Inter-Parliamentary\nUnion, the setting up of a council or forum of\nMediterranean States and the eventual creation of a\nconference on security and cooperation in the\nMediterranean deserve serious consideration.\nRegional approaches complement and reinforce efforts\nat the international level. In 1992, at the Helsinki follow-up\nmeeting of the then Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), Malta proposed that the\nCSCE should declare itself a regional arrangement by the\nterms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. We\nnote with satisfaction that relations between what is now\nknown as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) and the United Nations continue to be\nstrengthened. Apart from institutional benefits reaped\nthrough regular contact between the two organizations, what\nis more relevant is the increased cooperation on the ground\nin the various parts of the OSCE area.\nEver since Dipoli, the site of the first preparatory\nphase, Malta has contributed to the evolution of the OSCE\nprocess. It has promoted the Mediterranean dimension of\nthis process. Mediterranean and European security remain\nintimately and reciprocally linked. Strengthening of security\nand cooperation in the Mediterranean is an important\nelement for stability in the OSCE region. Consistent\nengagement by successive Malta Governments has\ncontributed towards the greater involvement of the\nMediterranean Partners for Cooperation in the work of the\nOSCE. We will continue to work to further this\nrelationship.\nThe regional approach has reinforced cooperation\nthrough the interlocking of different and distinct European\nand international organizations. In this respect. Malta pays\nhomage to the role of the Council of Europe in protecting\nand promoting dignity, human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms and in nurturing the principles of human\nsolidarity.\nWe are particularly heartened by the Secretary-\nGeneral?s stated intention to consolidate the partnership\nbetween regional organizations and the United Nations\nthrough a more structured, rational and cost-effective\ndivision of labour.\nDistinct from other organizations, the\nCommonwealth also continues to advance avenues of\ncooperation. Cross-regional projects among countries\nsteeped in a common tradition continue to unfold. Malta\nupholds this international effort through its participation\nin various programmes that promote sustainable\ndevelopment.\nDifferent scenarios face this Organization. We have\nlearnt that negotiating agreements is not enough.\nUniversality remains a priority as we develop the tools to\ndeal with emerging problems. Reform of this\nOrganization is another priority. Many of its structures\nmust better their effectiveness. Reform is not an end in\nitself \u2014 it is an ongoing process that necessarily requires\nperiodic review. We must remain open to the challenge of\nchange by being innovative and adaptive, seeking to\nreorient structures established in a different time, without\nbetraying the core principles that remain ever valid.\nMalta has steadfastly fostered awareness of the need\nto revitalize the General Assembly. With its universal,\ndemocratic character, this Assembly is the ultimate\nexpression of the principle of the sovereign equality of\nStates. Yet, conditioned by the past, the Assembly has not\nfully realized its potential. As the international consensus-\nbuilding forum, its role can be further strengthened, thus\nenhancing its authority.\nProgress has been registered in deliberations on\nSecurity Council reform, but consensus still evades us.\nThe question of which categories of membership to\nexpand dominates the discussion and attracts attention.\nHowever, other important issues, such as the transparency\nand openness of the Council, continue to develop. Malta\nattaches great importance to this aspect, which benefits\nthe widest majority of States.\nSecurity Council decisions legally bind all Member\nStates. Thus, procedures enhancing consultations between\nCouncil and Assembly members are of immense value.\nImproved methods introduced in recent years, while\nnurturing the symbiotic relationship that should bond\nCouncil and Assembly, prove that conferring does not\nhinder the Council?s ability to intervene with the required\nswiftness.\nIn seeking solutions, even on what type of expansion\nthe Security Council should undergo, the need for general\nagreement must be underscored. General agreement is not\nto be seen in quantitative terms; rather, it should be\nviewed as a guarantee that solutions have the political\n5\n\n\nsupport to come to fruition. Agreement on this sensitive\nissue must be comprehensive if it is to stand the test of\ntime. Lack of consensus on expanding the permanent\nmember category should not impede further progress.\nWe support the fallback position of the Non-Aligned\nMovement to limit enlargement to the non-permanent\ncategory for the time being. This will allow the process to\nmove forward without prejudice to an eventual continuation\nof deliberations on permanent category expansion.\nThe environment has been the focus of uninterrupted\nattention since the end of the cold war. The ushering in of\na new era of cooperation has enabled the international\ncommunity to address different areas requiring concerted\naction. An unprecedented number of treaties and\nconventions have been negotiated. Treaty bodies and\ninstitutions now function effectively, addressing distinct but\nrelated areas of concern.\nIn this new international milieu, the Charter?s broader\nnotion of trusteeship assumes renewed relevance. During\nmy presidency of this Assembly, the Trusteeship Council\nwas about to discharge its responsibility for the last of the\nterritories placed under its custody. Some suggested\nfreezing or dismantling the Council. I proposed that the\nTrusteeship Council be given additional responsibility in\ncoordinating international endeavours that safeguard\ndifferent areas of the common heritage of humankind.\nSince then, many others have proclaimed themselves\nfavourable to this type of reform. The identification of new\nadditional responsibilities for the Trusteeship Council forms\npart of the reform package proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral last year.\nWe have also taken note of the recommendations of\nthe United Nations Task Force on Environment and Human\nSettlements in its report to the Secretary-General earlier this\nyear. The positive openness to this proposal is encouraging.\nMalta intends to participate actively in the recommended\nconsultations to be undertaken by the Executive Director of\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in\npreparing for the next regular session of the Governing\nCouncil.\nThe application of the principles of trust and common\nresponsibility in a number of international conventions\nmakes their coordination the natural task of the Trusteeship\nCouncil. The principle of trust should retain its rightful\nplace in the institutional framework of this Organization.\nThe International Year of the Ocean is in its final\nquarter. Many feel that a forum is needed to consider the\nclosely interrelated problems of ocean space as a whole.\nThe Independent World Commission for the Oceans, on\nwhich I have the honour to serve, has vigorously\naddressed this vital issue. Malta suggests positive\nconsideration of the suggestion that this Assembly\ninstitute a biennial committee of the whole to review\nocean-related questions in an integrated manner.\nNotwithstanding our collective endeavours, peace\nremains daily threatened in different parts of the world.\nUnited Nations deliberations in response to such threats\nrightfully enjoy a high profile with the public and in the\nmedia. In most instances, the success of these\ndeliberations rests on the sheer dedication of the United\nNations officials in conflict zones and particularly on the\ncourageous sacrifice of troops forming part of United\nNations peacekeeping operations.\nThis year, we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary\nof United Nations peacekeeping operations. Peacekeepers\nhave faced risks, humiliation, threat and death. This\nnotwithstanding, they have never faltered in their duty or\ndetermination to bring hope where despair often prevails.\nDespite increasing risks, the United Nations has not\nshirked its responsibilities. Indeed, it has broadened its\npeacekeeping mandates. I had the opportunity to\npersonally bring this Assembly?s message of solidarity\nand support to peacekeepers serving in different parts of\nthe world. During the past five decades, the number of\npeacekeepers who have paid the supreme sacrifice has\ncontinued to grow. We salute and pay tribute to their\nmemory.\nLike others who have addressed this Assembly\nbefore me, I have outlined some challenges facing our\nOrganization. New problems continue to emerge,\npresenting us with daunting and confounding scenarios.\nYet, despite all the odds against it, the United Nations has\nwithstood the test of time. It has survived because it\ninvested faith in humankind and dispensed hope where\nmisery prevailed. It has gradually built the required tools\nto foster international cooperation.\nObstacles may continue to loom large, yet at no time\nin human history has the potential been so great. We must\nseize the opportunity provided us to act in concert. Our\ncommitment to the United Nations is unwavering. Our\ncommitment to sparing humankind from untold suffering\nis strong. Together, we can head into the new millennium\nimbued with the founding fathers? determination to save\n6\n\n\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. We owe\nthis to ourselves. We will strive to bequeath it to our\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Senegal takes pleasure in addressing, through me, its\nheartfelt congratulations to the President on his illustrious\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. His election is eloquent testimony to his\nintellectual and moral qualities and to his vast experience\nin international relations, and also reflects the unanimous\nrecognition by the Member States of our Organization of\nyour country, Uruguay, for its ongoing commitment in the\nservice of international peace and cooperation.\nWe express profound gratitude to his predecessor, Mr.\nHennadiy Udovenko, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nUkraine, for the skill and commitment with which he\ndischarged his duty throughout a particularly difficult year.\nFinally, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, a man of\nconviction who deserves our unreserved support in the\npursuit and achievement of the outstanding work of\nreform, to which he is fully committed in order to ready\nour Organization to meet the realities of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe annual sessions of the General Assembly\nprovide special opportunities for the great United Nations\nfamily to come together to consider collectively and\nthoughtfully the situation of the world and the problems\nand challenges that our Organization must meet as it\nseeks to bring about peace, progress and solidarity for\nhuman society.\nAs this century fades, we are living in an era marked\nby major challenges that involve all of us individually and\ncollectively. Our world is in the throes of transformation,\ninternationally as well as within each of our States, and\nour transition towards the third millennium is not without\ncertain contradictions.\nGlobalization has become a worldwide phenomenon.\nThe movement of people and ideas, the computer and\ninformation revolutions, the protection of the environment\nand the fight against drugs and terrorism have also\nbecome transnational phenomena that call for global\nreform and thoroughgoing international solidarity, which\nis the only thing that will allow us to attain our major\nobjectives \u2014 for while we are all similar, we are also all\ndifferent.\n\n\nAt the same time, fragmentations are increasing and\ndifferences are asserting themselves at the national level,\nthereby leading to civil wars and ethnic and tribal conflicts\nthat often jeopardize the structure of our States. Formidable\nwealth has been created for a tiny minority, while vast\nexpanses of absolute poverty remain; and while human\nrights are exalted here, they are mocked or trampled\nunderfoot elsewhere.\nThe United Nations, which is the repository of the\nuniversal conscience, must adapt to these changing realities\nand develop the capacity to act, often with urgency, in the\nservice of peace and to respond appropriately to the\nlegitimate aspirations of humankind. As we seek to attain\nthe goals that are before us, our Member States have the\nresponsibility and the duty to endow our Organization with\nthe tools that will allow it effectively and rapidly to\nimplement the agenda for the twenty-first century.\nIn this context, I should like to emphasize and\nwelcome two major developments that have marked the\nrecent history of the United Nations. I shall refer first to the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, not\nbecause it takes priority but because the head of State of\nmy country, President Abdou Diouf, has conferred upon me\nthe honour of being involved in this issue for the past two\nyears. Senegal was among the first signatories of the Statute\nof the Court and is waiting only for the certified copy\nbefore ratifying it. The Diplomatic Conference in Rome\nwas without doubt a historic gathering, as for the first time\nthe nations of the world, in particular those from Africa,\nunited by a single and shared desire for justice, together\nfound a legal means of deterring those who might be\ntempted to commit crimes against humanity, war crimes\nand crimes of genocide; a means of bringing them to trial,\nif there are grounds for doing so; and a means of\nsentencing them if they are found guilty. In short, we have\nsucceeded in forging the missing link in the international\nlegal system.\nThat gathering will also be remembered as historic\nbecause the Statute of the Court, which we solemnly\nadopted on 18 July 1998, in such a symbolically rich place\nas Rome, introduced major innovations in relations between\nStates and between national and international jurisdictions.\nFinally, if anyone needs to be reminded, I am happy\nto say that the Statute and the final act governing the Court\ncomplement, and thereby imbue with greater meaning, the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth\nanniversary we are commemorating this year as one of the\ngreat milestone events in the history of the United Nations.\nWhat is more, the Statute makes the ideal of justice more\nprecise and more alive.\nI am pleased to say that my country, Senegal,\nrecently became the first State member of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to ratify the\nProtocol on the Establishment of the African Court on\nHuman and Peoples? Rights, which was adopted at the\nmost recent OAU summit in Ouagadougou.\nLast year, during the fifty-second regular session of\nthe General Assembly, we all warmly welcomed the\nreform proposals of the Secretary-General, contained in\nhis report (A/51/950) entitled \u201cRenewing the United\nNations: a programme for reform\u201d. We were unanimous\nin believing that those judicious, balanced, innovative and\naction-oriented proposals were very timely because they\nwere in tune with the spirit and letter of the Declaration\nissued on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary, which\nstated:\n\u201cIn order to be able to respond effectively to the\nchallenges of the future and the expectations of the\nUnited Nations held by peoples around the world, it\nis essential that the United Nations itself be\nreformed and modernized.\u201d (resolution 50/6,\npara. 14)\nThis conviction, which we all shared, has today\nbecome an imperative. Indeed, through the dynamic\nimpetus provided by the President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Udovenko, the\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolutions through which it\nendorsed and reaffirmed the implementation of the\nmeasures and proposals recommended by the Secretary-\nGeneral. In this regard, I should like to convey my\nsincere congratulations to Ms. Louise Fr\u00e9chette, who has\nbeen appointed to the distinguished position of Deputy\nSecretary-General of our Organization, with particular\nresponsibility for development issues. To her, our partner\nin development, I wish every success in carrying out her\nhonourable and important mission.\nIn calling to mind the reforms that will enable the\nUnited Nations to become the cornerstone of a\nmultilateral system better attuned to the realities of the\ntwenty-first century, I could not ignore the delicate and\ncomplex negotiations under way within the Working\nGroup entrusted with the question of restructuring the\nSecurity Council. Security Council reform is a\nfundamental element in the overall reform of the United\n2\n\n\nNations, but we must recognize that it will not be an easy\ntask.\nWe all agree on the need to modernize and\ndemocratize that essential United Nations body, but we are\nfinding it difficult to reach consensus, or even general\nagreement, on such fundamental issues as the enlargement,\ncomposition and right of veto. Despite five years of\ndiscussions within the Working Group, we must not\nabandon our hopes and become discouraged. If we redouble\nour efforts and benefit from the momentum that we have\ncreated, I am convinced that in due course we will succeed\nin this great undertaking to restructure the Security Council\nby conferring on it greater legitimacy, credibility and\ntransparency.\nAfrica certainly has its place in this reform \u2014 a place\nthat must be acknowledged given its history and its destiny\nas a continent of the future in which there is room for\ncontinued growth.\nThe United Nations has traversed half a century, and\nduring the course of those years we have progressively laid\nthe groundwork for an international system that should be\nable to ensure our collective security. In this regard, our\nOrganization has been and remains an irreplaceable tool for\nthe promotion and maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Despite the numerous achievements recorded in\nthat area, we must agree about how much farther we have\nto travel, as well as about the bold initiatives to be taken in\norder fully to secure international peace and security.\nLongstanding conflicts continue to resist our efforts at\nresolving them, while a number of fresh crises \u2014 a new\ngeneration of conflicts linked to an upswell in ethnic or\nintercommunity violence \u2014 continue to be a source of\nmajor concern for our countries, especially those in Africa.\nThus, in the subregion of western Africa, while Sierra\nLeone was moving towards the total restoration of\nconstitutional order with the return to Freetown of the\ndemocratically elected President owing to efforts by the\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity and\nespecially the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), a mutiny broke out on 7 June last,\nspearheaded by part of the standing army of the Republic\nof Guinea-Bissau.\nAt the express request of the legal authorities of that\ncountry, Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, another\nneighbour of Guinea-Bissau, dispatched troops in\naccordance with the relevant provisions of the bilateral\nagreements signed by each of the two countries with\nGuinea-Bissau.\nI should like to reiterate that Senegal?s involvement\nin Guinea-Bissau is designed solely to help restore\nconstitutional order, ward off threats to the safety of the\ncivilian populations and foreigners, and contribute to the\nstrengthening of stability and security in the subregion\nand throughout Africa.\nOn 26 August 1998, ECOWAS, together with the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, succeeded\nin inducing the parties to sign a ceasefire accord, the first\nstep towards the normalization of life in Guinea-Bissau.\nIn the Horn of Africa, we have witnessed a drastic\ndownturn in the relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nIndeed, the armies of those two fraternal countries \u2014\nforced by history, geography and culture to live in perfect\nharmony and peace \u2014 launched military operations. And\nyet there have been numerous initiatives designed to bring\nabout a political solution of this new conflict. The\nbrotherly Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea should\nagree to sit down at the negotiating table and endeavour,\nwith the help of the current Chairman of the OAU, the\ncountries of the subregion and other participants of\ngoodwill, to find ways and means of reaching a peaceful\nsolution.\nElsewhere on the continent, in Angola and in\nSomalia, the road to peace is winding \u2014 if not\ntortuous \u2014 and uncertainty continues to prevail.\nAllow me to pay once again from this rostrum a\nrespectful tribute to the memory of Matre Alioune\nBlondin Beye, Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral in Angola, and of his companions in misfortune,\nwho included our fellow countryman Moctar Gueye, a\njournalist, all of whom died in an accident on the field of\nhonour in the service of peace.\nAll of Africa aspires to progress and to a better life,\neven though the conflicts it is enduring continue to pose\nmajor obstacles to a balanced and lasting economic and\nsocial development. We therefore have the obligation and\nthe duty, as members of the family of nations, to continue\nto strive to bring about a world order that is more stable,\nequitable and just.\nAware of this reality, Africans together, working in\nconcert with the OAU and in close cooperation with the\nUnited Nations, are participating more and more actively\n3\n\n\nin regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention,\nmanagement and resolution.\nI should like to take this opportunity to welcome the\npublication of the Secretary-General?s report on the causes\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa. In this invaluable report,\nthe Secretary-General offers a well thought out and\nobjective analysis of the causes of conflicts in Africa,\nrightly pinpointing the close link between stability and\ndevelopment, and finally recommending criteria, conditions\nand ways and means of ensuring, building and safeguarding\npeace in the interest of sustainable development in Africa.\nMy country, Senegal, convinced of the importance of\npeace in the Middle East and of the need for greater\nprogress in that respect, is actively supporting the peace\nprocess and remains committed to the achievement of peace\nin the region based on the relevant resolutions and\nagreements, which must be respected by all parties, if only\non the basis of the principle of pacta sunt servanda.\nThe time is ripe urgently to call once again on the\nparties involved, the co-sponsors and all peace-loving\nnations to ensure that fresh initiatives are taken to reconcile\nthe widely divergent viewpoints of the Palestinian Authority\nand the Government of Israel in order to restore a climate\nof confidence and cooperation, which is the only possible\nbasis for peace and peaceful coexistence among the peoples\nof the region.\nOngoing efforts to bring about general, complete and\nverifiable disarmament represent a major step in\nstrengthening international security. While significant\nprogress has been made in this realm in the past decade, we\nmust acknowledge that global disarmament, today more\nthan ever, remains a long-range objective.\nIndeed, the conflicts we have seen in recent years have\ndemonstrated that the massive destruction caused by\nconventional arms requires that initiatives be taken to deter\ntheir proliferation, and in particular the illicit traffic in\nsmall-calibre weapons, now a real scourge in Africa. Major\nefforts are being mobilized on the continent to fight this\nthreat, but it is obvious that Africa alone cannot possibly\novercome it. Senegal will spare no effort to contribute to\nthe elaboration of an international convention to fight the\nillicit traffic in small-calibre weapons.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the universal\ncharacter of the United Nations has achieved wide\nacceptance, and its universality gives our Organization\ngreater credibility and effectiveness.\nIn keeping with this principle, Senegal unreservedly\nsupports the request by the Republic of China to rejoin\nthe community of free nations and to be admitted as a\nmember of our Organization and of its specialized\nagencies. Accordingly, we have proposed that the General\nAssembly reconsider that part of resolution 2758 (XXVI)\nthat excluded the Republic of China from the United\nNations and from its specialized agencies.\nIn keeping with its purpose \u2014 to be a centre where\nnations work together for social progress through the\nachievement of improved living conditions \u2014 the United\nNations has made a remarkable contribution to\npinpointing the problems facing humankind.\nThroughout this decade, the United Nations has held\na series of major conferences that have enabled the\ninternational community to adopt at the highest political\nlevel a set of consensual plans of action. These have laid\nthe foundation for a new global partnership for\ndevelopment based upon the principle of national\nresponsibility and the imperative of international\nsolidarity, in the quest for a united response to the\nchallenges that face all of us. Never before has so\ngenerous and so highly promising an approach been taken\nto the concerns felt by the community of nations.\nThese action plans, apart from their degree of\nrelevance, constitute a set of formal commitments on\nmeasures that should be taken together. Without the\ncorresponding mobilization of new and additional\nresources, the specific actions expected from these noble\ninitiatives, whose grandeur and legitimacy derive their\nvery force from the ideals embodied in the Charter itself,\nare liable to translate into severely compromised or\ndashed hopes.\nAbove and beyond the problems linked to\nimplementing the results of the major conferences held\nthroughout the decade, the fact is that international\ncooperation for development now poses a paradox that we\ncannot ignore without betraying the ideals of peace and\ndevelopment that inspired the founding fathers of our\nOrganization.\n4\n\n\nMiguel de Unamuno, Rector of the University of\nSalamanca in Spain, once said:\n\u201cUnder certain circumstances, to keep silent is to lie\u201d.\nHow, then, can we remain silent before the obvious\ncontradiction between the incessant expansion of needs for\neconomic cooperation for development and the constant\ndecline in official development assistance, which is today\nat its lowest level in 25 years? How can we forget the\npersistent imbalances in multilateral international trade,\nwhose first and foremost role was, after all, to ensure for\neveryone, in developed and developing countries alike, the\nbenefits of a trading mechanism that was to be open,\nregulated, transparent, equitable and predictable? What\nvalues of humanity can still be invoked when at the dawn\nof the third millennium, in a world that has become a\nglobal village, over a billion men and women are deprived\nof even the barest elements of a decent life? The\nmarginalization and exclusion that haunt the daily lives of\nthese men and women give proof once again of the\nabsolute priority that the fight against poverty must have at\nboth the national and international levels.\nThis is why strong measures to breathe new life into\nNorth-South exchanges are today more imperative than\never. The General Assembly?s high-level debate devoted to\nrelaunching a dialogue to strengthen international\ncooperation through partnership and the draft plan for an\ninternational gathering at the highest level for development\nfinancing are encouraging initiatives, as would be initiatives\nfor fair compensation for commodities and a global\nsettlement of the debt crisis of developing countries.\nThe fifty-third session of the General Assembly\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The promotion, consolidation\nand expansion of the underpinnings of the State based on\nthe rule of law throughout the world; the strengthening of\nnational institutions for the defence of human rights; the\nintegration of human rights into the major activities of the\nUnited Nations system; the promotion of the right to\ndevelopment \u2014 these seem to us to be the essential pillars\nof a global policy for the benefit of human rights and\nfreedoms at the end of this century.\nIn this context, my delegation would like to salute the\nmajor initiatives undertaken by Mrs. Mary Robinson, High\nCommissioner for Human Rights since she took office,\nparticularly those directed to our continent, Africa, which\nare fully in keeping with our expectations. This means, in\nfact, that more than ever before, we must promote dialogue\nwith Governments, strengthen dialogue between\ninstitutions within the United Nations system and strive to\nrationalize the machinery of human rights.\nThe fight against the global drug problem remains a\nconcern shared by the entire international community\nbecause of the multiple and pernicious ties that drug-\ntrafficking has been able to establish with phenomena\nsuch as transnational organized crime, terrorism, large-\nscale banditry and illegal arms-trafficking networks \u2014\nparticularly those involving small calibre weapons,\nespecially in Africa. This illicit trafficking in narcotics\nand psychotropic substances has become a dangerous\nthreat to the peace, stability and security of all nations,\nStates and regions of the world at the end of the\nmillennium.\nThis is why my country, Senegal, welcomed the\nholding last June in the presence of numerous heads of\nState and of Government in this Hall of the special\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to the drug\nproblem. Now it is important for all of us to work for the\neffective implementation of the important conclusions\nreached at that meeting, both at the national and\ninternational levels.\nBefore I conclude, allow me to say a few words\nabout the financial crisis and the need to strengthen the\neffectiveness of the United Nations. Our Organization has\nbeen in the midst of a very worrisome financial situation\nfor several years now. The causes of this situation have\nbeen debated at length right here and it does not seem\nnecessary for me to recall them now. I would simply like\nto stress that the reform process that we have all\nundertaken cannot possibly be brought to a successful\nconclusion within this situation of financial instability that\nthe Organization is experiencing at a time when it is\nbeing called upon to act on many different fronts.\nThe new international context, and the\nmultidimensional nature of the challenges to be met\nrequire that we have a restructured and modernized\nUnited Nations that is endowed with the capabilities\nnecessary to come to our help in resolving our disputes,\neliminating injustices and disparities and avoiding\nexclusion and selfishness.\nIt is enough for us to want these things, because we\npossess the resources and capabilities to attain them.\nHumanity has already met so many challenges in the\ncourse of its troubled history that we can have no doubt\n5\n\n\nnow that it is indeed capable of meeting the challenges of\nthe third millennium as well.\nSo far as we are concerned in Senegal, under the\nleadership of Mr. Abdou Diouf, President of the Republic,\nwe are ready to shoulder our responsibilities in a genuine\nspirit of solidarity and collective effort in order to realize\nour ambitions and dreams. We owe it to ourselves, but\nespecially to the generations to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I bring greetings, Sir, from the\nGovernment and the people of Nigeria, on whose behalf I\nam honoured and privileged to address this fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly, which is taking place\nunder your presidency. Your election to the presidency is\nan expression of the confidence which Member States\nrepose in you and a measure of our faith in your capacity\nto bring to bear on the work of the Assembly your wisdom,\ncompetence and diplomatic skills. I congratulate you most\nwarmly on your election and also wish you a very\nsuccessful tenure.\nMy delegation would also like to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the\nexcellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of the\nfifty-second session.\nWe also take this opportunity to express our\nimmense satisfaction with the way Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan has steered the affairs of our Organization. We\nwish to assure him of our fullest support and cooperation\nas he leads our Organization into the twenty-first century.\nThe United Nations represents the will of all\nmankind to collectively seek solutions to the common\nproblems facing our world. It demonstrates the ingenuity\nof the human spirit to assemble the diverse peoples of the\nworld in a collaborative effort to attain the goals of\ninternational peace and security, promotion of socio-\neconomic development, respect for human rights, good\ngovernance and rule of law. Our active participation in\nthe affairs of this Organization since independence in\n1960 is indicative of our belief in its continued relevance\nas a unique institution where all nations \u2014 big and small,\nrich and poor, developed and developing \u2014 meet on the\nbasis of equality and mutual respect to harmonize their\ninterests and policies for the common good.\nIt is for this reason that we have continued to\ndemonstrate our commitment to work in collaboration\nwith Member States for the strengthening and\nrevitalization of the United Nations and its agencies. We\ntherefore believe strongly that the issue of reform and\ndemocratization of the United Nations must be brought to\nthe front burner. Reform is a continuing process and is\nconsistent with the rapid changes taking place in our\nworld. Our Organization will become irrelevant if it fails\nto adapt its structures and management style to present-\nday realities. In this regard, my delegation wishes to\ncommend Mr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, for his\ndedication and steadfast commitment to the cause of\nreform, and the generally positive attitude of Member\nStates to the critical issues of reform and democratization\nof the United Nations.\nHowever, we must admit that substantive progress\nhas been very slow because of the narrow positions which\nsome delegations and regional groupings have continued\nto take on the fundamental issues of reform and\ndemocratization of the United Nations. We therefore urge\nall Member States to demonstrate urgent political will in\nthis task of renewing the Organization for the next\nmillennium by working out mutually acceptable\ncompromises that will move the reform process forward.\nIn doing this, we shall be able to build an Organization\nwith the capacity and the potential to make our world\nsafer and more prosperous.\n7\n\n\nWith regard to the particular issue of the reform and\ndemocratization of the Security Council \u2014 a subject to\nwhich my country, being one of the original sponsors of the\nrelevant resolution, attaches great importance \u2014 I am\ndisheartened to note that no tangible substantive progress\nhas been made five years after the creation of the Open-\nended Working Group on the subject. We note here again\nthat mistrust and suspicion among States thwarted any\nvisible movement towards a successful outcome. Yet the\nstatus quo is not in the best interest of the general\nmembership of the United Nations. Surely, the Council\nneeds to be restructured, its membership expanded in both\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories and its\nworking methods, decision-making methods and decision-\nmaking processes improved. This is the path towards the\ndemocratization of the Council, which will thereby enhance\nthe legitimacy and effectiveness of its decisions on critical\nissues of global peace and security.\nMy delegation is also of the strong view that the\nreform of the Security Council must also touch on the\nproper relationship between the Council and the General\nAssembly. The Charter of the United Nations assigns to the\nSecurity Council primary, but not exclusive, responsibility\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security;\nhence, there is also a role here for the General Assembly.\nUnfortunately, however, the voice of the General Assembly,\nwhich is the most democratic organ of the United Nations,\nis often drowned out by that of the Security Council on\nissues of global peace and security.\nOn the specific issues of the composition and size of\nthe Council, my delegation continues to assert that the\ncurrent anomaly of African non-representation in the\npermanent membership category must be corrected as a\nmatter of urgency, as our continent, with its 53 Member\nStates, collectively constitutes almost one third of the entire\nmembership of the United Nations. In this context, the\ndecision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\nseek two permanent seats for Africa in a reformed and\nexpanded Council can simply not be ignored. The demand\nis legitimate, credible and made with a full sense of\nresponsibility and relevance in the international system. It\ndeserves the full support of all Member States.\nIt is our deep conviction that a world without the\nUnited Nations would be inconceivable, especially in the\nwake of renewed conflicts in several parts of the globe. In\nthis regard, it is a matter of concern that Africa accounts\nfor a disproportionate share of global conflicts, with their\nimplications for human suffering and deprivation. The scale\nof human tragedies arising from conflicts within and among\nAfrican States is alarming. We are pleased to note that\nthe Security Council is currently giving special\nconsideration to the causes of conflict in our continent,\nwith a view to identifying how the international\ncommunity could work in partnership with us to resolve\nthem. This initiative to focus attention on the need for a\nrenewed and concerted international effort to promote\npeace and stability in our continent is clearly\nunprecedented and deserves our commendation.\nNigeria?s role in the furtherance of the objectives of\nthe United Nations, especially in the field of peacekeeping\nand peace-building, is well known. We have made great\nefforts in the promotion of peaceful resolution of conflicts\nin parts of Africa where innocent lives and property have\nbeen dangerously at risk. Nigeria has joined hands with\nlike-minded States to restore law and order. This was the\ncase in Liberia and, most recently, in Sierra Leone, where\nPresident Tejan Kabbah was restored to his position as\nthe democratically elected President in March this year.\nThis was the first time in the recent history of Africa\nthat a democratically elected regime overthrown by a\nmilitary coup was restored as a result of a collective\naction in a subregion. As the current Chairman of the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), Nigeria is proud to have provided the\nleadership within the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG) for the collective subregional efforts which\nresulted in that epoch-making event.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express our\ndeep gratitude to the international community for its\noverwhelming support during the crisis, which helped, in\nno small measure, to demoralize the rebel forces and\nspeed up the restoration of democracy and the rule of law\nin Sierra Leone. The war in Sierra Leone is over; the\nsame can be said of Liberia, but the threat remains. We\ntherefore urge the international community and\ninternational humanitarian organizations to take an active\ninterest in rehabilitation efforts in the two countries. A lot\nremains to be done there.\nCurrently our subregional grouping, through its\nCommittee of Seven, is actively involved in restoring\npeace in Guinea-Bissau, where a rebel group took up\narms against the elected Government. It joined efforts\nwith like-minded groups and a result a ceasefire was\nagreed upon a few weeks ago. We are optimistic that this\nagreement will hold.\n8\n\n\nWe have also helped to create within the Organization\nof African Unity a continent-wide Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. This facility\nenjoys wide support. However, it has been unable to live up\nto the lofty ideals for which it was set up, owing largely to\ninadequate resources in terms of military hardware and\nfunding. We invite the international community and other\ninterested bodies to support the cause of peace and security\nin Africa through the OAU regional and subregional\ninstruments for conflict prevention, management and\nresolution.\nNigeria is disturbed by the escalation of terrorist\nactivities in many parts of the world. The recent tragic\nbombings in Kenya and Tanzania, where some 260\ninnocent lives were lost, have brought home graphically to\nus all the fact that no country or society is immune from\nthe activities of terrorists. We condemn these bombings.\nTerrorism is one of the most heinous crimes against\nhumanity. It constitutes a serious threat to international\npeace and security. We must enhance international\ncooperation to combat and eliminate it in all its\nmanifestations. We must reflect our common concern for\nthis problem through support for an international convention\non terrorism.\nMy Administration came to the helm in Nigeria last\nJune and began its short tenure with a few clear-cut\nobjectives and policy thrusts. The most important is the\ndesign and implementation of a transparent, free and all-\ninclusive programme of transition to civil rule within the\nshortest time-frame. This decision was welcomed by the\npolitical class.\nOur goal is to return our country to a democratically\nelected civilian government on 29 May 1999. To this end,\nwe inaugurated the Independent National Electoral\nCommission (INEC) on 11 August 1998, with full powers\nto organize and manage the various stages of the electoral\nprocess without pressure or interference from any external\nbody or authority. There are no restrictions to the formation\nof political parties, and several political parties are already\nseeking registration. The party registration guidelines just\nissued by INEC emphasize the role of the electorate as the\nultimate determinant of the existence and success of\npolitical parties. This is democracy par excellence and\nconfirms the confidence of Nigerians in INEC.\nFurthermore, the Independent National Electoral\nCommission has published the timetable for the various\nelections in the Transition Programme, beginning with the\nlocal government elections in December 1998 and\nculminating in the presidential elections scheduled for 27\nFebruary 1999. We are committed to sustaining the\nindependence, integrity and transparency of INEC. Every\nstage of the elections may be freely observed by\ninternational monitors from the United Nations, the\nCommonwealth and other interested bodies. These\nmeasures will ensure the credibility and integrity of the\nwhole electoral process. In this regard, we note with\nsatisfaction that both the United Nations and the\nCommonwealth have already dispatched assessment teams\nto Nigeria to meet with INEC officials with a view to\nreaching agreement on the modalities and the substance\nof cooperation between the Commission and the two\norganizations.\nThe draft constitution presented by the National\nConstitutional Conference in 1995 has now been\npublished and will be ready for wide circulation in due\ncourse. All comments and views arising from the public\nwill be duly presented for consideration prior to\npromulgation.\nI am aware that on the question of human rights\nobservance, Nigeria has recently been the subject of\ninternational attention. It is the objective of my\nadministration, with the support and understanding of the\ninternational community, to move Nigeria in the direction\nof fullest respect for fundamental human rights, good\ngovernance, accountability and rule of law. This\ncommitment to human rights has been amply\ndemonstrated by the release of political detainees, the\ngranting of pardons to some convicted persons and the\nwithdrawal of charges against others. The general level of\nindividual freedom, in particular freedom of expression\nand association, has greatly improved. The cases of\npeople who are being detained and have not been\narraigned before the courts and of a certain class of\npersons already convicted for offences are being\nexamined, and appropriate decisions will be taken.\nAlready, the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice of\nthe Federation, in conjunction with the Minister of\nInternal Affairs and the National Commission on Human\nRights of Nigeria, have zoned the country for the purpose\nof accelerating the decongestion of prisons.\nWe wish to reiterate our call on those Nigerians who\nare currently in self-imposed exile to return and\nparticipate in the political and economic development of\nour country. With our quest to improve our socio-\neconomic infrastructure and climate for governance, we\nwill conduct a census of Nigerian professionals and those\n9\n\n\nwith special talents currently excelling worldwide with a\nview to harnessing all of the country?s human resources.\nI have also visited all our military formations to\nreconfirm the commitment of the armed forces and police\nto the democratization programme. The officers and men of\nthe Nigerian armed forces and police, like the majority of\nour people, yearn for democracy in a united and peaceful\ncountry. They are overwhelmingly in support of our\ndemocratization programme.\nI stand before this body as the leader of a country\nwhich is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversible\nprocess of transition to democracy. Therefore, having\nhonoured our commitment to the restoration of the\nfundamental human rights and freedoms of our people and\nadvanced the prospects of democratization in Nigeria, we\nnow call on the Western countries to lift the sanctions\nwhich some of them have imposed on our country. Today,\nperhaps more than ever before, we require the support and\nunderstanding of all the friends of Nigeria and the\ninternational community as a whole to help us in the\nimplementation of our programmes and policies aimed at\nuplifting the living standards of our people.\nIn conclusion, a silent but peaceful revolution is taking\nplace in Nigeria. Our people are determined to ensure that\nsustainable democratic governance is established in the\ncountry. Nigeria is clearly at the threshold of a new\nbeginning in its domestic political and socio-economic\nstructure and its foreign relations agenda. This is the time,\ntherefore, for the international community to give the\nnecessary encouragement and support for our endeavours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my distinct honour and\nprivilege to address this body once again. In doing so, may\nI take the opportunity to offer, on behalf of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica, sincere congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. My thanks are\nalso extended to Ambassador Udovenko, who so ably\nguided the fifty-second session.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has been\nindefatigable in his efforts to bring about peace in various\ncountries and regions. To him we express our thanks and\ncongratulations. Last year, I extended an invitation to him\nto visit the Caribbean. He has not yet done so. The\ninvitation remains open.\nThe Caribbean region continues to demonstrate its\ncommitment to the democratic process. Since we last met\nin this forum the people of several of our States, within\nthe provisions of the existing rules, freely expressed their\nwill as to who should lead them into the new millennium.\nOur assertion that democracy is alive and well is not\na reflection that all is well in the region. The Charter of\nthis Organization imposes an obligation on all its\nMembers to work for the peace, security and economic\nand social development of all peoples of the world. As\nwe seek to discharge that obligation, it behoves us to be\nconstantly cognizant of those factors and events which\nwould militate against our success. Some of these are\nnatural and unavoidable; others are man-made and\nregrettable.\nThe Caribbean was only a few days ago severely\nimpacted upon by one such natural disaster, Hurricane\nGeorges. The damage inflicted was extensive, particularly\n\n\nin St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Haiti and the\nDominican Republic. On their behalf, I urge this body to\ngenerously respond to their expressed need for assistance in\nthe reconstruction work. But the Charter obligations of the\nUnited Nations call for more than an ad hoc response\narrangement. We must first recognize the acute\nvulnerability of small States to natural disasters such as\nhurricanes, floods, volcanoes, earthquakes and so on, and\ntheir intrinsic limitations in mitigating and responding to\nthem.\nWhat is being proposed, therefore, is the establishment\nof a disaster reconstruction fund under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, the resources of which would be available\nfor quick and effective response to the needs of small\nStates post disaster. And there is still more that must be\ndone. Global warming and the greenhouse effect must be\nhalted.\nThere are on the agenda of this fifty-third session of\nthe General Assembly many matters of profound\nimportance to the Commonwealth of Dominica and the\nCaribbean Community as a whole. These include\nmacroeconomic policy questions on trade and development;\nthe revitalization of the economic growth and development\nof developing countries; the United Nations Decade for the\nEradication of Poverty; the protection of the global climate\nfor present and future generations of mankind; and\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean\nCommunity.\nThat cooperation is nowhere more necessary than in\nour fight to maintain the integrity of the market for our\nbananas. Our fight is against some very powerful members\nof this very United Nations, which seem determined to\nderail our democracy, upset our efforts to eradicate poverty\nand undermine the peace and security of our region.\nThe people of the Commonwealth of Dominica and\nthe people of the Caribbean Community look to the United\nNations to intervene on their behalf. The people of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean Community\nare firm in their conviction that globalization and trade\nliberalization cannot be allowed to result in the\nmarginalization and economic disintegration of small\ndeveloping States.\nWe seek a level playing field on which our people can\nengage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than\nbe for ever subjected to the aid-and-dependency syndrome.\nOur expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry,\nwhich has served us well, in no way reflects any\nmisunderstanding of the reality of the current trade and\neconomic environment.\nWe in the Commonwealth of Dominica are actively\nengaged in the diversification of our economy, involving\nthe agricultural, tourism and service sectors. We have\nmade progress towards improving air access to our\ncountry and are providing increased opportunities for our\nchildren to receive secondary and tertiary education.\nWe consider the recent naming of one of our\nnational parks, Morne Trois Pitons, as a World Heritage\nsite to be a resounding statement of our commitment to\nthe preservation and effective utilization of our\nenvironment.\nIt is a source of comfort to us that all this has been\nachieved in an environment of social and political\nstability. We must, however, sound the warning bells, as\nwe note with great foreboding the practice by some of\ndeporting to our countries hardened criminals who have\nlearned and practised their trade in their adopted\nhomelands for several decades. In like manner, the\nunwarranted disruption and dismantling of families\nthrough inhumane immigration laws requires the attention\nof this Organization.\nI respectfully submit that in all our deliberations and\nactions, as indeed in every aspect of human endeavour,\nthe aspirations and legitimate expectations of the people\nmust be central. The 21.5 million people of the Republic\nof China on Taiwan aspire to be represented in this body.\nThey have a legitimate expectation that their country, a\nfounding Member of the United Nations, should have its\nmembership restored. We cannot but lend them our\nsupport. Ours must be a policy of inclusion.\nA cursory look at our agenda reveals 21 items\ndealing with the financing of United Nations\npeacekeeping or observer missions, all associated with\nwar, threats of war, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, terrorism and the\nlike. This suggests that although much has been achieved,\nmuch more must be done. We must focus our attention on\nthe preservation of peace and security, thereby reducing\nthe need for the restoration of peace and security.\nThere should be no compromise in the fight against\nterrorism, whether it be in Kenya, Tanzania or Northern\nIreland. We note and are glad for the encouraging signs\nemanating from the Middle East. We should take our cue\nfrom the famous British politician who said \u201cTo jaw-jaw\n2\n\n\nis better than war-war\u201d, and seek to settle our disputes\npeacefully in the spirit of our Charter.\nBy the time this fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly comes to a close, many speeches will have been\ndelivered from this podium, articulate, substantive speeches,\ndelivered by men and women who together hold and wield\nenormous power.\nThe peoples of the world have heard us talk. But is\nthat all they want from us? I submit that the answer is a\nresounding no. They want action. An agenda that includes\n165 items suggests that much work lies ahead of us. Yet I\npropose one additional task: that the Secretary-General and\nhis able team of professionals subject all of our speeches to\ndetailed scrutiny and analysis and, in keeping with the\ndirective of the Summit of the Americas, let us \u201cput words\ninto deeds\u201d.\nIn this way, we will give the lie to those critics who\nclaim this place is only a talk shop, and demonstrate to\nthem that it is indeed an action station.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean\nCommunity hold dearly to the principles enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations. We are firmly committed to\nworking with all Members and nations to bring about an\nimproved quality of life for all the peoples of this world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Before I deliver my\nstatement, let me express on behalf of my country our\nheartfelt sympathy to the Governments and peoples of the\nCaribbean that have fallen victim to the devastating\nonslaught of Hurricane Georges. I hope that we all in the\ninternational community will extend to them comfort and\nhumanitarian assistance with all deliberate speed.\nLet me add my voice to the other speakers in\nfelicitating Mr. Opertti upon his unanimous election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.\nNamibia will readily lend him our full support and\ncooperation during his tenure of office. Our two\ncountries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Uruguay and Namibia \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have worked very\nclosely together and with other friendly countries in\nbringing about the African-Latin American initiative, a\nnecessary and timely innovation aimed at concretizing a\nmutually felt need for greater interaction between our two\nneighbouring continents. I wish him all the luck.\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, former Foreign\nMinister of Ukraine, who so ably presided over the work of\nthe General Assembly during a period in which the\nOrganization took bold steps towards institutional\ntransformation and in various social and technical fields.\nNot only did he prove his leadership qualities and\ndiplomatic skills, but he also, and more importantly, sought\nto promote the important role of the General Assembly\nitself in the larger context of the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, and particularly the\npreservation of human security. For small and developing\ncountries like Namibia, the Assembly is where democracy\ncomes alive as the world\u00e2s biggest parliament.\nTo the Secretary-General of our Organization,\nMr. Kofi Annan, my delegation pledges its fullest support\nfor his tireless efforts to provide effective leadership and\npractical ideas as we try to find workable solutions to the\nnew challenges facing the global community. His annual\nreport and the important statement he delivered yesterday\nprovided inspiration and reassurance. I congratulate him\nfor his vision and initiatives.\nLet me say a word or two about the United Nations\nreform process. We are two years away from the new\nmillennium and, for some time now, we have all being\naddressing some of those challenges that lie ahead and\nhow the United Nations can transform itself to more\neffectively respond to the needs and aspirations of its\nMembers in the twenty-first century. The initial work of\nrevitalization of the United Nations in the economic,\nsocial and development fields has been partially\ncompleted. Reform of the United Nations is an ongoing\nprocess and Namibia believes that an important lesson can\nbe learnt from what has been achieved so far: no quick\nfixes, but also no indefinite negotiations. The management\nof the global economy is a top priority. Economic\ndisparities and social backlogs in our societies must be\nmitigated.\nAfrica\u00e2s position on the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil is on the table. It includes two permanent seats\non the Council and additional non-permanent seats.\nNamibia also calls for the abolition of the veto power.\nWe have done so before and I am repeating that call once\nagain, for the veto negates the very idea of United\nNations reform and democratization.\nLet me also say here that, while we take into\naccount the purposes of the United Nations as stated in\nArticle 1 of the Charter, it is also important that we take\neffective and collective measures to finance the United\nNations. In this regard, Namibia urges all Member States\nto pay their contributions in full and on time and to clear\ntheir arrears in order to enable the Secretary-General to\nfully carry out the resolutions of the General Assembly\nand, indeed, also those of the Security Council.\nI wish to say a word or two about peace and\ndevelopment. In 1995, all the world leaders who\nconverged on New York for the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations reiterated, in their\ndifferent languages yet in unison, their common\ncommitment to the highest virtues of human dignity,\npeace and security, sustainable development and\nprosperity for all. Three years later, it looks everywhere\nas if it is a question of business as usual. Much more\nneeds to be done in the areas of poverty eradication,\nhuman resource development and gender equality, as well\nas transfer of technology and resources for development\nfrom the rich to the poor.\n27\n\n\nWherever in this, our one world, economic disparity,\nsocial injustice, armed conflicts, political instability and\nindeed environmental degradation prevail, there can be no\nrewarding human existence, meaningful productivity to\nsustain life and civilization, nor lasting scientific and\ntechnological breakthroughs in the service of this and future\ngenerations.\nToday\u00e2s very topical questions of democracy, human\nrights, good governance and globalization now seem to end\nup on the back burner of the global agenda. Other priorities\nalways seem to enjoy more attention. Much needed\nresources are being driven more and more away towards\ngreater benefits for the military-industrial enterprises of the\nrich and the powerful nations. The result is further\nimpoverishment of the nations and peoples of the third\nworld.\nHappily, we have been joined by two illustrious\nchampions in a worthy human cause: Danny Glover,\nAfrican-American actor activist, and Nadine Gordimer,\nSouth African Nobel laureate, who will, jointly and\nindividually, articulate worldwide the plight of the forgotten\nmasses in the third world, as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme\u00e2s Goodwill Ambassadors. Both of\nthem are my personal friends, and I congratulate them and\nheartily welcome them aboard.\nIt has been said by a third world leader that:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We live in an international jungle. There is no law\nand order in international relations. There is very little\njustice. The high and the mighty rule everywhere. The\nweak and the poor just have to lump it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nIt is hardly possible to dispute this.\nWith regard to issues of multilateral trade that are of\nconcern to the developing countries, there is an imperative\nneed for us to articulate a specific and constructive South\nagenda. The developing countries must develop a common\nposition on, for example, whether there should be a new\nround of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations or\nwhether a sectoral approach is preferable. These are our\ncommon concerns that the Group of 77 should be\nspearheading in WTO negotiations, as well as in the South-\nNorth dialogue.\nGlobalization is here to stay. We welcome it. But it is\nnot in itself a panacea for ensuring the people\u00e2s economic\nrights at home or a just world order, based on cooperation\nand equity. Globalization must be our thing collectively as\nmembers of the human family. When one section of the\nfamily prospers, the rest should be allowed to share in\nthat bonanza. To condemn a section of the family to a\nperpetual state of marginalization would be inhuman and\nunkind.\nThe heavy burden of external debt is denuding the\nresources and capacity of poor nations, mainly those in\nAfrica. External debt cannot merely be reorganized. Debt\nwrite-off is the best and the most humane thing to do,\nunder the present circumstances. Some major Western\ncreditors have written off debt, others should follow.\nBretton Woods institutions should rethink their insistence\non bleeding conditionalities in terms of official capital\nflows and debt relief in favour of providing assistance\ntowards stimulating economic growth and productivity\nthat will help poverty eradication in the developing\ncountries. In this connection, it is to be hoped that the\nrecent meeting held in New York with the World Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be a\nharbinger of new and better things to come.\nThe Group of 77, which is the task force for the\nmember States of the Non-Aligned Movement, together\nwith our many friends, must continue to work hard in\norder to hasten implementation of the Agenda 21\nProgramme of Action in its entirety. For globalization and\nliberalization to be carried out successfully in pursuit of\nour shared ideals of democratization, economic justice\nand human security, South-North dialogue should be open\nand constructive in the spirit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d partnership,\ndevoid of confrontation and blackmail.\nAt the 1998 Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) Summit of Heads of State or\nGovernment, held at Grand Bay, Mauritius, on 13 and 14\nSeptember, the regional African leaders endorsed policy\nguidelines that will facilitate the speedy completion of\nSADC\u00e2s transformation into a dynamic development\ncommunity. This exercise will be carried out on the basis\nof the review and rationalization of the SADC Programme\nof Action. The Summit reaffirmed the ongoing work on\nsectoral coordination by member States to ensure\nstreamlining of sectors and increase regional integration\nand productivity. The member States were urged to\nexpedite ratification of the trade protocol as a matter of\nthe utmost priority. This will open up greater\nopportunities for regional economic cooperation and trade\nbetween them.\nAdded to these actions that have already been taken\nor are being envisaged was the strong reiteration that all\n28\n\n\nSADC regional policies and activities must be carried out\npursuant to the objectives and goals of the African\nEconomic Community. The first significant step taken in\nthis direction was the signing on 25 February 1998, in\nAddis Ababa, of the Protocol on The Relationship between\nthe African Economic Community and the Regional\nEconomic Communities. For 1999, the Summit set a theme\nfor SADC:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153SADC in the next Millennium: The Challenges and\nOpportunities of Information Technology.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nThat is the vision that seeks to promote the socio-economic\nempowerment of the people. Political and economic reforms\nthat have started in Africa must stay on course and produce\nthe results that our people want.\nRegarding regional conflicts, as other speakers have\nnoted, the maintenance of international peace and security\nis constantly being threatened by ongoing as well as new\nregional conflicts. Lately, dastardly acts of terrorism and\nindiscriminate counter-attacks have become frequent\nhappenings. In Europe, bloody confrontation and human\nsuffering persist in Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo. In West\nand South Asia, a very explosive political, military and\nnuclear situation is fast developing into an undeclared state\nof war and a likely destabilization of that strategic region.\nWe welcome the high-level and face-to-face meetings now\ntaking place between some of the leaders from that region.\nSadly, there is a serious situation of stalemate,\nreversals and prevarication in the Middle East, and the\npeace process has by now, to all intents and purposes,\nreached a precipitous dead end. Israel cannot hope to live\nin security if the universally accepted principle of land for\npeace is not scrupulously adhered to and implemented\nwithout delay. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople, including the right to self-determination and the\nestablishment of an independent State of their own, cannot\nbe sacrificed because of a single-minded insistence on\nsecurity. An early agreement on a just, comprehensive and\ndurable peace for the whole of the Middle East is the only\nviable guarantee for peace, stability, security and\ncooperation in the best interests of one and all. Namibia\nsupports that approach and not the politics of confrontation\nand nullification.\nIn our own SADC subregion, some of the old conflicts\nhave gone from bad to worse and new ones have been\nignited. In Angola, renewed military attacks and defiance of\nthe demands of the United Nations and the rest of the\ninternational community by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA have\nderailed the peace process and delayed the finalization of\nthe implementation of the remaining aspects of the 1994\nLusaka Protocol. The Security Council has reacted\nforcefully to UNITA\u00e2s non-compliance by imposing\nstringent sanctions on it and, once again, has demanded\nspeedy and full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.\nFurthermore, the last summit of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), held in Ouagadougou, was equally\nunsparing in its condemnation of Mr. Savimbi and\nUNITA for unceasing delaying tactics and political\nviolence against innocent Angolans and the unsuspecting\ncitizens of neighbouring States, including my own\ncountry, Namibia. The recently concluded SADC Summit\nresolved, among other things, that measures must be taken\nto ensure compliance by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA with\nthe decisions that member States have made through\nSADC, the OAU and United Nations resolutions.\nThe Summit further called on the international\ncommunity, particularly countries and leaders who have\nan influence on Mr. Savimbi, to persuade the rebel\nmovement to rededicate itself to the path of peace and\nreconstruction in Angola, as a matter of urgency.\nOn another front, the Kingdom of Lesotho is once\nagain teetering on the brink of serious destabilization and\nsocial disorder just because some politicians, who were\ndefeated in the last general elections, have taken the law\ninto their own hands. It has become an acute situation,\nwhich our regional leaders are urgently and jointly trying\nto resolve peacefully.\nMoreover, other misguided men, driven by a blind\nambition and appetite for needless confrontation, have\nplunged the Democratic Republic of the Congo into a\ndevastating war, which has resulted in inter-African\nfighting on the battlefield of that sister country. Namibia\nhas joined the other SADC member States, at the express\ninvitation of President Laurent Kabila and his legitimate\nGovernment, for the sole purpose of preventing the\ncollapse of the State machinery and the violation of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow SADC\nmember State by the invading armies and their\ncollaborators. Namibia\u00e2s involvement is for peace,\ndemocracy, human rights and regional cooperation.\nThe recent SADC Summit expressed itself on the\nsituation, and it is important that I quote a few passages\nwhat it said, as follows:\n29\n\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Summit expressed deep regret at the outbreak of\nwar in DRC, as a result of attempts by rebels and\ntheir allies to forcefully remove the Government of\nPresident Kabila from power.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Summit welcomed the initiatives by SADC and\nits member States intended to assist in the restoration\nof peace, security and stability in the DRC, in\nparticular the Victoria Falls and Pretoria initiatives. In\nthat regard, the Summit reaffirmed its call for an\nimmediate cessation of hostilities and commended the\nGovernments of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe for\ntimeously providing troops to assist the Government\nand people of the DRC to defeat the illegal attempt by\nrebels and their allies to capture the capital city,\nKinshasa, and other strategic areas. The Summit\nemphasized the need for all political actor in the DRC\nto commit themselves to orderly and peaceful\ntransition to multi-party democracy, primarily through\nconstructive consultations and negotiations involving\nall stakeholders.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nAs freedom fighters, we never relied on ethnicity to\nwin victory against the oppressor nor can we ever accept\ntoday any idea of regional hegemony based on ethnicity and\nHerrenvolk tendencies from any quarter. African unity and\ncooperation must be based on a genuine spirit of solidarity\nand sharing, and not on subversion and disunity.\nThere are some outstanding questions that I would like\nto deal with now briefly.\nOur agenda still has on it the unfinished business of,\nfor example, decolonization, conflict resolution and\npeacekeeping.\nThe legitimate cause of the Palestinian people, led by\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, and their full\nenjoyment of the right to self-determination, independence\nand sovereignty, cannot end with the creation of an\nAuthority which is only an interim mechanism. The goal\nwhich the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and\ncertainly we in Namibia support, is that of unfettered\nstatehood as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations\nand international law. I say this simply to restate our well-\nknown position on the question of Palestine.\nCyprus, a fellow Member State of the United Nations\nand of the Commonwealth, is being bullied by a bigger and\npowerful neighbour which is perpetuating by means of fiat\nthe unlawful division of that peaceful island State. Namibia\nis aware of the repeated initiatives of the Secretary-General\nto end the deadlock; so far his efforts have been\nunsuccessful. The United Nations and the world\ncommunity must not forget the nation of Cyprus and its\nheroic people.\nAt last, there is a light at the end of the tunnel\nconcerning the resolution of the question of Western\nSahara. Following the Houston accords brokered by\nMr. James Baker, former United States Secretary of State,\nthere is now an agreement between the parties concerned\nfor a free and fair referendum to be held in December\nthis year. With this in mind, Namibia urges the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\nNations to ensure that the deadline is kept and that the\npeople themselves are given a genuine choice regarding\ntheir future. In this way, Africa\u00e2s last colonial question\nwill be finally resolved and the Kingdom of Morocco will\nreturn to the fold of the OAU, of which it is a proud\nfounding member. It will be a happy day for all Africans.\nNow that the question of East Timor has been put\nback on the front burner, Namibia lends its full support to\nthe latest steps that the Secretary-General has taken to\nfind an amicable and lasting solution, in cooperation with\nIndonesia, Portugal and the inhabitants of East Timor.\nWe apparently welcomed too hastily what we\nthought was good news concerning a peaceful settlement\nof the Lockerbie affair by the application of law. The\ngood news has all of a sudden been eclipsed by bad news\nor misunderstandings that need to be carefully sorted out\nin the spirit of give and take among the principal parties.\nThere are clearly serious legal and technical matters that\nrequire further consultations and clarifications between\nLibya, on the one hand, and the United Kingdom and the\nUnited States, on the other. Africa\u00e2s well-reasoned and\nconstructive position on this issue was reinforced at the\nlast OAU summit, held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.\nIn this connection, the decisions taken there are being\nimplemented by African leaders. Among them is a\nrenewed call for the Security Council to lift the punitive\nand outdated sanctions imposed on Libya several years\nago. The suffering of innocent people should quickly be\nbrought to an end.\nIn conclusion, allow me to share a few personal\nthoughts. In his valedictory address to the General\nAssembly, President Mandela of South Africa referred to\nthe connections between the United Nations and South\nAfrica and invoked some memories of the past, beginning\nin 1946. Those memories and connections also included\nmy own country, Namibia, a former colony of apartheid\n30\n\n\nSouth Africa and a territory for which the United Nations\nassumed direct legal responsibility for 24 years, from 1966\nuntil 1990. That special linkage ended on 21 March 1990,\nthe glorious day of our independence. But the long-\nestablished relationship between the United Nations family\nand the Namibian people continues unabated.\nDuring the past more than 26 years of my active\ninvolvement in politics and diplomacy, I have known the\nUnited Nations system as my home. In various incarnations,\nI have walked the heights, the depths and the corridors of\nthis magnificent edifice of human brotherhood, liberation,\nequality and justice. Many mentors and friends from across\nthe globe have held my hand in support, encouragement\nand solidarity. They have contributed enormously to my\nformation and maturity.\nI did my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in\nthis country under a United Nations fellowship. On 25\nSeptember \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is, next Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I am going to receive\nan award from the World Association of Former United\nNations Interns and Fellows for, they tell me, an\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153outstanding contribution to the promotion of human\nrights, peace and development, especially within the\ncontext of promoting Namibia\u00e2s nation-building and\nthe role that United Nations training and other\neconomic and technical cooperation activities can still\nplay\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nI am deeply touched by this generous gesture, and I\nam immensely grateful. This is the result of my partnership\nwith the United Nations and its varied agencies as well as\nwith friends the world over.\nI, actively supported by my Government, have\nannounced my candidature for the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth regular session, in\n1999. In this connection, I am most delighted to announce\nfrom this mighty rostrum that in June this year, in\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, the OAU Assembly of Heads\nof State and Government endorsed me as the sole African\ncandidate for the position. I trust that I can count on all the\nMember States from other regions to cast their votes in\nsupport of my candidature when the time comes. By doing\nso, you will have made me extremely happy. But, more\nthan that, you will have endorsed unanimously the\ncollective wish of the African continent.\nLastly, and in this context, I endorse the sentiments\nexpressed by our Secretary-General in respect of making\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, which falls\nin the year 2000, the Millennium Assembly. But I believe\nthe preparations must be made during the fifty-fourth\nsession, and Africa is ready to lead the way into the\ntwenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The light of\nhuman existence is kindled by man's longing for\nsalvation. The essence of the message of divine prophets\nand the content of the teachings of prominent sages have\nbeen primarily aimed at human salvation. It is painful to\nobserve in the arena of human history the deprivation and\nabject misery of human beings; the deprivation of women,\nmen and children enslaved by the whims of the ruling\npowers; and the ill fate of rulers deprived of compassion\nand sympathy for their own nations. Hence, virtuous rule\nand good governance have been evanescent in human\nhistory.\nIronically, much too often will and freedom of\nthought have been frustrated and liberty suffocated in the\nname of salvation, and much too often salvation has been\nportrayed as disposing of any and all restraints on\ninsatiable human desires. Reason and love have thus been\nsacrificed at the altar of the whim. At times, liberty has\nbeen trampled in the name of justice, and at other times\njustice has been obliterated in the name of freedom. The\nresult has been humanity\u00e2s age-old deprivation from both\njustice in liberty and liberty in justice.\nIt is only a few centuries since genuine knowledge\nbegan to be construed as the source of power rather than\nan agent of its control. Ever since, knowledge, instead of\nserving human salvation and exalting human character,\nhas been used as an instrument in the hands of those\nwhose only object is to advance their own narrow,\nutilitarian self-interest.\nDespite its magnificent progress, humanity has\nsuffered massively over these centuries from\ndiscrimination and anguish. Survivors are still among us\nwho can testify to the incalculable destruction caused by\nthe two world wars, and despite the birth of the United\nNations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a positive achievement for mankind \u00e2\u20ac\u201d true\npeace based on justice still remains a scarcity.\nParticularly desperate is the situation of the countries\nin the underdeveloped world, where so many still suffer\nfrom famine, illiteracy and disease, and some remain at\nthe mercy of rulers who do not even take the trouble of\npretending to respect democratic standards or enjoy\npopular support. So often they attempt to replace the\nabsence of popular support by dependence on power\nwhose sole purpose is the pursuit of domination and self-\ninterest.\nOppressive and dependent governments deny their\npeople the opportunity to experience democracy by\nperpetuating intimidation and terror in society, and they\n3\n\n\npromote a culture of violence which inadvertently leads\ntheir opponents to resort to the same. The powers that breed\nand nurture such regimes can therefore not escape blame.\nPrimarily responsible here are those powers whose\nintelligence services take pride in their dark record of\noverthrowing popular governments and supporting\nunpopular ones.\nThis image of our world is indeed grim and repulsive.\nUntil the day that the wise and the learned wrest the reins\nof power from the unwise and the capricious, this image\ncannot at all be transformed.\nNonetheless, in my opinion, beyond the darkness and\ndoom, genuine beauty can still be discerned in the deeper\nlayers of history. I can assert with certitude that, on the\nwhole, human life has blossomed spiritually and materially.\nAnti-colonial struggles and independence movements of\nmany nations in this century exemplify this blossoming and\nprogress. The collapse of the bipolar world order in the\nfinal decade of this century and the swift march of the\nworld towards diversity, coupled with renewed assertion of\nidentity in the international arena by nations demanding\nequality, are other significant achievements in this direction.\nThe fantasy of a unipolar world ruled by a single\nsuper-Power is but an illusion, indicating the failure of its\nholders to keep pace with history. I am confident that\npowerful nations, such as the American people, will not\naccept that their good name, potential and national prestige\nbe exploited for the advancement of the dream of a\nunipolar world by the politicians, motivated by the short-\nsighted material and factional interests of a few. The\nevolution of public opinion in the West in support of\npeaceful relations on the basis of mutual respect testifies to\nthis assertion.\nNow allow me to speak here as a man from the East,\nthe origin of brilliant civilizations and the birthplace of\ndivine prophets \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed,\npeace be upon them all. I come from the noble land of Iran,\nrepresenting a great and renowned nation famed for its\nancient civilization, as well as for its distinguished\ncontribution to the founding and expansion of the Islamic\ncivilization, a nation that has survived the strong winds of\ndespotism, reaction and submission, relying on its cultural\nand human wealth. It is a nation which pioneered in the\nEast the establishment of civil society and constitutional\ngovernment in the course of its contemporary history, even\nthough, as a result of foreign interference and domestic\ndeficiencies, at times it may have faltered in its course; a\nnation which has been at the forefront of the struggle for\nindependence and against colonialism, although its\nnational movement was subverted by a foreign-\norchestrated coup. And it is a nation which carries the\ntorch of its popular revolution, not won by force of arms\nor a coup, but by dethroning a regime of coup d\u00e2\u00c3\u00a9tat\nthrough the power of the enlightened word. In the course\nof its new experience, our nation has endured eight years\nof an imposed war, pressure, sanctions and various unfair\naccusations. It has also fallen victim to terrorism, the\nominous phenomenon of the twentieth century.\nToday, the Iranian nation draws on its past to\ncontemplate a better future, while defying reactionary\ntendencies and, backed by principles and ideals rooted in\nits religious, national, historical and revolutionary heritage\nand benefiting from positive achievements of\ncontemporary civilization, marches, be it through trial and\nerror, towards a promising tomorrow.\nThe Islamic revolution of the Iranian people was a\nrevolt of reason against coercion and suppression.\nCertainly, a revolution which resorted to logic in the\nphase of destruction is much better disposed to resort to\ndialogue and reason in the phase of construction. Hence,\nit calls for a dialogue among civilizations and cultures\ninstead of a clash between them.\nFrom this rostrum and the pulpit of the United\nNations, I announce that humanity, despite all calamities\nand hardships, is heading towards emancipation and\nliberty. This is the unalterable divine providence and\nhuman destiny. The malice and depravity of no individual\ncan ever violate divine providence and the course of\nhistory.\nThe word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153history\u00e2\u20ac\u009d predates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153philosophy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and man\nis the pillar of history. History itself is the reflection of\nthe light of being upon various facets and dimensions of\nhuman existence. Thus, it is a unique and universal entity,\nalbeit diverse in nature. Whenever this unique entity takes\non a new guise, a new era is ushered in. Our assessment\nof history indeed emanates from our perception of\nhumanity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d its pivot and pillar.\nHuman beings, who, in the Persian poet Saadi\u00e2s\neloquent description borrowed from a saying of the holy\nProphet of Islam, are various organs of the same body,\nare outside the reach of biology or psychology.\nUnderstanding human beings requires a philosophical and\nreflective view of man and history. God created man with\nHis own hand and in His own image, and He breathed\ninto him of His own spirit, and thus humanity is but a\n4\n\n\nsingle entity, and so is its history. The hand of God granted\nhumankind history, will and freedom of choice; the image\nof God provided him culture, spirituality and liberty; and\nthe spirit of God bestowed upon him life and vitality. Thus,\nhuman beings have come to possess history, culture and\nliberty.\nNot only do all human beings originate from one and\nthe same origin and share a continuous and integrated\nhistory, but also one may further postulate a single final\npurpose. This purpose of history is none other than spiritual\nculture, and genuine human liberty is its absolute\nprerequisite.\nWhether or not one subscribes to the view that man is\ndoomed to whirl in iterative historical cycles or to grapple\nwith historical moments or epochs, and whether or not one\nholds history to be self-driven, driven by human urges, by\nmodes of production or by superhuman heroes, everyone\ncan agree that it is only the ever-inspiring fountain of faith\nthat breaks every old and new shackle from humanity and\narrests the iterative eternal cycle, eventually emancipating\nhumankind from the bounds of historical determinism, just\nas it is only the vivifying breeze of liberty that can offer\nfaith and spirituality to humanity.\nIt is thus that humankind could, in consonance with\nthe mystic Persian poet Hafez, serenade that\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will subvert this high inverted vault if it should ere\nrotate 'gainst my dictate.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nOr, in the words of the Gospel according to Saint Mark,\nif one had faith in God one could say to the mountain\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (The\nHoly Bible, Mark 11:23)\nThrough such an understanding of freedom, the tenets\nof human dignity can be upheld in the face of political\ndomination and virtue, and hope against baneful blasts of\ndespair and nihilism. Here, one can discern the trajectory of\nhistory towards liberty.\nThe history of humankind is the history of liberty.\nOnly that interpretation which describes history as the arena\nfor manifestation of liberty can provide an opening of the\npast for the benefit of mankind. Regardless of all\nphilosophical systems that have attempted to attribute\nmeanings, directions and laws of evolution to history, we\ncan realize that because human history is intertwined with\nthe history of liberty, when human beings are liberated\nfrom imposed constraints of exploitation and social\nenslavement, as well as from unrefined animal instincts\nsuch as violence and savagery, they will then side with\ntruth and justice in line with their human nature. Thence,\nhuman history shall become the glorious history of truth\nand realization of justice. And this could be another\nexpression of the famous religious doctrine of\nMessianism.\nWhether we embark on an empirical and inductive\nstudy of history or an intuitive one, most thinkers would\nagree that the essence of humanity has flourished and that\nmore veils of ignorance have been removed from the\nminds of human beings.\nI have deliberately used the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flourished\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\ninstead of the more common terms, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historical\nprogress\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, in order to emphasize that, whatever school of\nphilosophy of history we may follow, we can still share\nan understanding of this general and universal conception\nof history.\nThe establishment and continued functioning of the\nUnited Nations is a testament to the progressive path of\nthe world and of human history. Today it does not require\nmuch argument to establish that instead of war and\nbloodshed one could and indeed ought to resort to\ndiscourse and dialogue. That fact has not been achieved\neasily, as if the bloodstained history of humanity forms an\nantecedent to this seemingly simple proposition.\nYet so long as imprudent potentates can obliterate\nflowers and trees, hope and mirth from the face of the\nEarth with a quick stroke of their folly and cruelty, it is\npremature to celebrate the ultimate triumph of the Logos\nover the sword.\nThe twentieth century did not only witness the\nmanifestations of violence and human sufferings at the\nhands of old colonialists and the unprecedented injustice\nof their modern heirs; it was also the century of the rise\nand fall of totalitarian regimes. Let us hope that in the\ncoming century resort to force and violence shall not be\nglorified and that the essence of political power shall be\ncompassion and justice, externally manifested in dialogue\nbetween civilizations.\nThe question is how the United Nations may take\nthe necessary measures to respond to this evolving global\nclimate, and what impact it will have on the changing\ncourse of the life of mankind longing for salvation.\n5\n\n\nI would like to propose, in the name of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, that the United Nations, as a first step,\ndesignate the year 2001 as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Year of Dialogue Among\nCivilizations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, in the earnest hope that through such a\ndialogue the realization of universal justice and liberty may\nbe initiated.\nAmong the worthiest achievements of this century is\nthe acceptance of the necessity and significance of dialogue\nand the rejection of force, the promotion of understanding\nin the cultural, economic and political fields, and the\nstrengthening of the foundations of liberty, justice and\nhuman rights. The establishment and enhancement of\ncivility, whether at the national or international level, is\ncontingent upon dialogue among societies and civilizations\nrepresenting various views, inclinations and approaches. If\nhumanity, at the threshold of the new century and\nmillennium, devotes all its efforts to institutionalizing\ndialogue, replacing hostility and confrontation with\ndiscourse and understanding, it will leave an invaluable\nlegacy for the benefit of future generations.\nSimilarly, it is necessary that as members of the\nUnited Nations we revisit the history of the formation of\nthis Organization, with a view to reforming and improving\nthe institution through a rational exchange of views.\nThe United Nations took shape in a dark era of human\nhistory, when many of its current members were still\nexperiencing the bitter and abominable conditions of\ncolonial rule. As a consequence, the new Organization\nreflected the domination of the powerful few. Things have\nchanged now, and the opportunity has presented itself to\nrestructure this Organization, particularly its Security\nCouncil. Here I would like to refer to the wise statement of\nthe leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his inaugural\naddress to the Eighth Session of the Islamic Summit\nConference, held in Tehran, that the Islamic countries,\nrepresenting one billion and several hundred million people,\nshould acquire a permanent seat in the United Nations\nSecurity Council, with the same privileges as current\npermanent members, as long as they are enjoyed by those\nmembers.\nThe time has come to reject, through understanding,\nthe discriminatory veto privilege, and in so doing take\nanother step towards the recognition of fair and equal rights\nof all Member States.\nLet us all join hands in solidarity against genocide,\naggression and the humiliation of mankind in various\ncorners of the world. Let us prevent the continuation of\nshameful tragedies which have tarnished the face of this\ncentury in Palestine, Afghanistan and Kosovo, and in\nmany other parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nPeace and security in the Middle East, imperative as\nthey are, will only be established through the recognition\nof the right of all Palestinians to exercise sovereignty over\ntheir ancestral homeland. The presently occupied Al-Quds\nal-Sharif ought to be the house of dialogue and\nunderstanding. Resonating from the depth of history, its\nvoice speaks intrinsically against racism and Zionism.\nGreat monotheistic religions can live peacefully together\nin Al-Quds al-Sharif, but it is the very Israeli rule that has\nmade such a coexistence impossible. Palestine is the\nhome of all Palestinians \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Muslims, Christians and\nJews \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and not a laboratory for the violent whims of\nZionists.\nIn Afghanistan, there is no military solution to that\ncountry\u00e2s predicament. The universal outrage at the\nmassacre and genocide being perpetrated there \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nparticularly the tragic killing of Iranian diplomats and a\njournalist, as well as at the continued captivity of the\nIranian aid workers in the hands of the Taliban \u00e2\u20ac\u201d calls\nfor sober analysis and expeditious action to bring the\nperpetrators of these crimes to justice.\nAfghanistan, the land of people of dignity and\nculture, has now been turned into a haven for violence,\nterrorism and the production of and trafficking in\nnarcotics. The Afghan people, as other peoples in the\nworld, have the inalienable right to determine their own\ndestiny and the right to enjoy a broad-based Government\nrepresenting all ethnic groups, communities and\ntendencies in that country. This is the only way to restore\ntranquillity in Afghanistan. This requires resolute\ninternational cooperation in order to inhibit the lucrative\nand deadly business of producing and smuggling\nnarcotics, illicit trafficking in weapons and cultivation of\nterrorism. The United Nations, in cooperation with the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and all concerned\nStates, should bring all the parties to the conflict to the\nnegotiating table, paving the way for the tyrannized and\ndestitute Afghan people to freely determine their own\ndestiny and, backed by solemn global support, should\nbring the rogue elements into compliance with the will of\nthe international community. Simultaneously the\nOrganization should plan for the mobilization of requisite\ninternational assistance for the reconstruction of\nAfghanistan once the necessary political conditions are in\nplace.\n6\n\n\nIn Kosovo, the legitimate rights of the embattled\npeople should be recognized, and the Yugoslav Government\nshould be made to respect these rights.\nHonest and sincere efforts to combat terrorism in all\nits forms and manifestations, including state terrorism,\nconstitute another important priority for the Government of\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. Terrorism is a product of\ndesperation and nihilism. In a world swirling in the orbit of\nviolence and oppression, serious combat against terrorism\nwill not advance beyond the realm of words and slogans.\nThe eradication of terrorism must be concurrent with a\nglobal search for justice.\nThis assertion should in no way be interpreted as a\njustification for any form of terrorism. As required by our\nreligious, moral and cultural values and norms, we\nunequivocally oppose all forms and manifestations of\nterrorism, and we shall combat it vigorously and earnestly.\nIn our view, in order to eradicate this menace, we should\nengage in serious and transparent international cooperation\nto combat terrorism, and at the same time redouble our\nefforts to attain the objective of global justice.\nAt the threshold of the third millennium, the world\nalso needs to be liberated from the nightmare of nuclear\nwar and weapons of mass destruction. Recent nuclear tests\nin our region, which have led to further complications,\nmake this all the more imperative. We should all realize\nthat the idea of attaining security through the acquisition of\nsuch armaments is nothing but an illusion.\nThe manifestation of a resolute global determination\nto eliminate all existing arsenals of weapons of mass\ndestruction within an agreed time-frame would provide a\nclear objective and lend credence and add dynamism to the\ninternational efforts against the production and proliferation\nof these deadly weapons. The establishment of zones free\nfrom weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the\nMiddle East, constitutes an appropriate first step in\nalleviating tension and mistrust emanating from these\nweapons. We in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as victims of\nthe use of weapons of mass destruction, are more cognizant\nthan anyone else of their horrifying impact. We shall thus\nstay at the forefront of international efforts to establish and\nstrengthen universal arrangements for their destruction.\nSecurity, development and prosperity in the third\nworld require the promotion of cooperation and the\nutilization of proven arrangements and mechanisms for\nconfidence-building. In this regard, it is encouraging that\nthe Eighth Islamic Summit Conference in Tehran, cognizant\nof this necessity, established an appropriate mechanism to\nfoster confidence through dialogue among Islamic\ncountries.\nAs a first step in this direction, I invite our\nneighbours in the Persian Gulf region, who have\nwitnessed two destructive wars in the span of one decade,\nto establish a security and cooperation system in the area.\nIn short, confidence and peace cannot be attained\nwithout a sober revision of the mentality of the cold war.\nThe advancement and promotion of a culture of peace is\ncontingent upon the recognition of the constructive role of\nnations coupled with avoidance of domination,\nunilateralism, confrontation and exclusion.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, in keeping with its\nfundamental beliefs and deep-rooted heritage of\ncivilization, seeks a world blessed with peace and\ntranquillity based on human dignity. It has accorded the\nhighest priority in its foreign policy to the removal of\ntension. In line with the principles of the Islamic\nrevolution, Iran is determined to follow its balanced\npolicy of expanding relations with its neighbours and\nother countries on the basis of respect for independence\nand equality of rights.\nComprehensive peace, over and above peace among\nhuman beings, also calls for peace between mankind and\nnature, which in turn requires that mankind bring to a halt\nthe systematic devouring of nature and instead emphasizes\nthe coordination of man and nature. The preservation of\nthe environment, as the common natural heritage of\nmankind, constitutes a most important priority of the\ncoming century.\nBefore concluding, I would like to emphasize the\nparamount role of the family, women and youth in the\nmaking of a better tomorrow and the consolidation of the\nfoundations of civil society throughout the globe.\nThe family is the unique setting for human progress\nand the development of the personal and social identity of\nindividuals. Regrettably, today, especially in the\nindustrialized countries, the foundations of home and\nfamily have been undermined, threatening the emotional,\nmaterial and spiritual health of human life. A global effort\nis required to confront this danger, lest the flames of this\ncentre of warmth, affection and education be gradually\ndimmed by the cold and vicious winds of alluring\nfacades, lust and material gain.\n7\n\n\nEfforts at the global level geared to the promotion and\nstrengthening of respect for women and their rights require\na critical reassessment of the traditional and inappropriate\nviews about women. The traditional outlook, based on the\nerroneous notion of the superiority of men over women,\ndoes injustice to men, women and humanity as a whole.\nEqually nefarious is the view that disregards the differences\nbetween men and women. We should recognize that both\nmen and women are valuable components of humanity who\nequally possess the potential for intellectual, social, cultural\nand political development, and that comprehensive and\nsustainable development is possible only through the active\nparticipation of both men and women in social life.\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, the United\nNations should have faith in the new generation, to whom\nthe next century belongs. It should thus be prepared to\naccept and embrace the requirements of believing in youth.\nLet us bring ourselves to accept that we are not custodians\nof youth and that the young do have the right to enjoy the\nsocial process of growth and development, a right they\nshould exercise consciously and wilfully. With such a new\nperspective, and drawing upon the dynamic ability and\nintellectual capability of the new generation, we can\ntogether chart a much better and brighter future for the next\ncentury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is my\nprivilege and honour to address the fifty-third session of\nthe General Assembly on behalf of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\n12\n\n\nAt the outset I would like to congratulate Mr. Didier\nOpertti on his election as President. His well-known skills\nand experience in international affairs guarantee the wise\nconduct of this session. Our gratitude goes to the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine.\nJust a few days ago the outcome of the recent general\nelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina was made public. We\nare satisfied with the fact that those important elections,\nconducted under the auspices of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), passed\npractically without incident or disruption. According to the\ngeneral assessment by the international and local monitors,\nwe had free and fair elections.\nA new chapter in the political life of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is about to begin. The new Parliament and the\nnew Council of Ministers will have to address without\ndelay a number of issues of vital importance for our\ncountry. Indeed, at stake is the destiny of a country with a\nparticular internal structure: three constitutive peoples, two\nentities and one internationally recognized State. Only\nthrough scrupulous respect for equal rights and adequate\nparticipation in power by the parties in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina can we achieve the goal, which has no\ncredible alternative: a modern State based on the rule of\nlaw, parliamentary democracy, respect for human rights and\na market economy. This will also open the door for\nintegration into European and transatlantic institutions. The\nmost encouraging sign in this direction was the recent\nDeclaration of support by the European Union and the\nestablishment of its Joint Task Force with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nIt is obvious that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina\ncannot do this alone. We must prove to our friends and\nsupporters from around the world that we can be a reliable,\nresponsible partner in this joint project, which in the end\nshould place Bosnia and Herzegovina in the family of\ndemocratic States. But it also must be remembered that,\ninevitably, those in Bosnia and Herzegovina who behave\ndifferently or against the rules will not be allowed to\nparticipate in this endeavour of crucial importance.\nThe question about the future of my country is being\nasked in many quarters of the world. The same question,\nbut certainly with an additional existential and emotional\ncharge, is in the air in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself.\nThere are no easy answers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever, since we are talking here about the future of a\nvery specific country, the possible answer is at the same\ntime both simple and complicated. It is simple because of\nthe fact that whoever holds public office in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is obliged to implement the provisions of the\nDayton Agreement fully and unconditionally. On the other\nhand, it is complicated because it will, to a large extent,\ndepend on good political will, a sense of historical\nresponsibility and the determination of each player in the\ncomplex State structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina to do\nso.\nAlmost three years after the signing of the Peace\nAgreement, the consolidation of peace and the\nreconstruction process in Bosnia and Herzegovina is\nentering a new stage. From the very beginning, the\nmilitary component was implemented well and an\nenvironment of overall security was created. Thus, we\nwere able to focus our energy on the civilian aspects of\nthe Agreement, which proved to be extremely complex.\nWe went through the rough waters of various obstacles,\nmistrust, misunderstanding and obstruction. But it was\nalso a time of the first signs of confidence-building and\nthe establishment of the necessary foundation for a\nhealthy partnership.\nIn spite of the often justified criticism regarding the\npace of progress, one must recall some of the important\npositive steps that have been made: one flag, a common\ncurrency, common license plates, common passports,\ngenerally improved freedom of movement and significant\nreconstruction results. On the other hand, the return of\nrefugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin,\nthe proper functioning of State institutions, an\nindependent judicial system, and the uniform protection\nof human rights still represent major problems in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\nTherefore, with the elections behind us, the renewed\npolitical resolve and energy must be applied to finding a\nsolution to all the aforementioned issues. A multi-ethnic,\nmulticultural Bosnia and Herzegovina within both its\nentities, in which mutual respect, equality and cooperation\namong the constitutive peoples and different ethnic groups\nare shared assets, will be the best answer to superficial\ntheories on the inevitable clashes between different\ncultures and civilizations.\nThe continued presence of the international\ncommunity in Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainly\nneeded. Without the generous help and support it has\n13\n\n\nextended so far, little would have been achieved. The\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies stand high\namong those that are doing their best to help Bosnia and\nHerzegovina overcome its problems. But the time has come\nto consider that one future path may lie in changing the\ndonor-recipient relationship into a concrete, project-oriented\njoint venture, in which local companies and infrastructure\ncould have a more substantial participation.\nThis would no doubt contribute to the faster economic\nrehabilitation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to reaching\nthe level of self-sustainable growth. Better economic\nprospects will certainly enhance our ability to overcome\nmany existing obstacles and to achieve the overall stability\nof the country; and the ultimate goal of handing over the\nbusiness of running the country to the citizens of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina would be better served.\nAt a more global level, this is the way for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina to become a factor for stability in the region\nand an active partner in building security architecture on the\ncontinent. As has already been mentioned, we in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina cannot do this alone. But, hand in hand\nwith the international community, we can all continue our\njourney into the next millennium with more hope and better\nprospects.\nIn less than two years, the century \u2014 full of\nachievements and unbelievable technological progress, but\nalso a period of two world wars and a number of smaller\nbut no less tragic conflicts \u2014 will be over. We are stepping\ninto a new millennium with a lot of expectations, but also\nwith heavy baggage.\nHere, I would be morally and politically reckless if I\ndid not highlight the tragic and increasingly alarming\nsituation in the Kosovo region of the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia. Events there certainly have a contaminating\neffect on Bosnia and Herzegovina, at least psychologically.\nHowever, the situation is in itself worthy of our great\nconsideration and engagement, regardless of its impact on\nBosnia and Herzegovina or beyond.\nLessons must have been learned from the international\ntreatment Bosnia and Herzegovina received during our\nrecent crisis. Decisiveness, urgency and the proper\ncombination of tools and remedies available to the key\nfactors must all be there in order for us to achieve a speedy\nand proper solution. The human, national and democratic\nrights of all the parties must be taken into consideration, as\nmust the territorial integrity of all States in the region. No\nmatter how we get there, all lasting solutions end with a\npolitical settlement \u2014 one which all the parties need to\nabide by, if not always enthusiastically support. We are\nthere to help in any way we can and the active support of\nus all will be necessary.\nBosnia and Herzegovina, on the other hand, has tried\nto learn from its recent past. When you have to pay a\nhigh price for a lesson, you also learn well. Among other\nsteps, Bosnia and Herzegovina has ratified the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction. We now need to continue our efforts to\ndecontaminate the ground, and the assistance of the\ninternational community is also essential in this\nendeavour.\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s experience was also\ncritical to the recent adoption of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court in Rome. We played a vital\nand active role in Rome, since we are convinced that\njustice and reconciliation, legality and peace, are\nintertwined. The new Court should take into consideration\nthe experiences of the International Tribunal for the\nformer Yugoslavia, whose impact on lasting peace in\nBosnia and Herzegovina is critical.\nWe in Bosnia and Herzegovina are convinced that\nthose responsible for serious violations of international\nhumanitarian law should be brought to justice, regardless\nof the ethnicity of the victims or perpetrators. We have a\ndirect and decisive interest in securing compliance by all\nsignatories, and all others who are obligated, with all their\ncommitments under the peace Agreement, including full\ncompliance with the International Tribunal.\nOne thing we can be proud of is our universal\nOrganization, the United Nations, which, throughout this\ntime, has been the main vehicle for promoting peace,\ncooperation and development on our planet. In the face of\nnew challenges, we would like to see the United Nations\neven more efficient and instrumental in dealing with a\nnumber of global issues.\nThe struggle against terrorism, illegal arms and drug-\ntrafficking and violations of human rights is in the\nforefront of our common agenda for a better future. The\nrole of a dynamic, effective, well-focused United Nations\nis indispensable in that respect.\nThis year, we are also celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Thanks to that document and to the tireless\n14\n\n\nactivities of people around the world, human rights have\nbecome a genuine global issue, and ensuring their respect\nand protection is one of the most important ongoing tasks\nof the international community.\nThe end of this millennium in human history has\nwitnessed a growing number of massive humanitarian\nemergencies. We need to draw conclusions from them\nbecause the flagrant violation of human rights and\nhumanitarian law and the barbaric acts of savagery that we\nhave witnessed in various parts of the globe in recent years\nare an affront to our common humanity.\nBased on our own experience in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, we have learned lessons that we must share\nwith the international community as a part of our\nhumanitarian duty. We owe it to ourselves and to our\nchildren. That is why my Government intends to propose\nfor the favourable consideration of this Assembly a set of\nbasic tenets of humanitarian action in emergency situations.\nThe purpose is neither to duplicate nor to downgrade the\nongoing efforts, but rather to supplement what exists and to\nenhance awareness of the need to adjust international norms\nand practices to new realities. We trust that all Member\nStates will join us in this effort so that, together, we are\nable to contribute to the development of a new international\nhumanitarian order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Opertti and his\nfriendly country, on behalf of the State of Kuwait, our\nsincere congratulations on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are\nconfident that his extensive and incisive knowledge of\ninternational affairs will greatly help him to guide the\nAssembly?s deliberations to success. Let me assure him of\nour delegation?s willingness and desire to cooperate with\nhim in a businesslike and constructive manner in order to\nachieve all the objectives of this session.\nI also wish to express our appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his remarkable\nstewardship of the previous session.\nAllow me take this opportunity to commend the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts\nto reform the United Nations, to restructure it, and to\nstreamline and revitalize it in various fields, with a view to\nmaking it responsive to the demands and challenges of the\ntwenty-first century. In this regard, we welcome the\nstatement made by the Secretary-General before the general\ndebate, when he presented his report on the work of the\nOrganization. We note with satisfaction that some essential\nproposals for reform presented by the Secretary-General\nhave been implemented.\nWe hope that the reform exercise will continue with\nthe full backing of all Member States. The reform of the\nOrganization and the enhancement of its effectiveness for\nthe fulfilment of its objectives and the attainment of its\npriorities depend in large measure on the political will of\nMember States and the extent of their commitment to their\nobligations under the Charter and the resolutions of its\nvarious organs. We consider it unrealistic to expect the\nUnited Nations to deliver more while we provide less.\nFrankly, Kuwait feels that the success of the reform\nexercise hinges primarily on the availability of adequate\nfunding for the various mandated activities. Such funding\ndepends on the payment by all Member States of their\nassessed contributions to both the regular budget and the\npeacekeeping budget. In this regard, I am pleased to\nreport that the State of Kuwait continues to fulfil its\nfinancial obligations in full and on time. It is our fervent\nhope that this obligation will be honoured by all Member\nStates of the Organization.\nThe reform and restructuring of United Nations\norgans has become a practical necessity required for the\ncommon interest of all Member States. There is no doubt\nthat the circumstances in which the United Nations was\nestablished over 50 years ago have changed, and that vast\ndevelopments which could not be overlooked have\noccurred at various international and regional levels.\nTherefore, Kuwait is in favour of restructuring the\nSecurity Council so that its composition and membership\nreflect current political and economic realities. The\nchange should also ensure greater efficiency in the\ndischarge of the primary responsibilities of the Council,\nas set forth in the Charter, regarding the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nIt is clear now, after five years of debate in the\nWorking Group on the expansion of the membership of\nthe Security Council and the reform of its methods of\nwork, that reaching a consensus on the optimum increase\nin membership is not an easy matter. Deep differences\nstill exist among Member States. Nonetheless, we remain\nhopeful that reaching an agreement is still possible. In\nthis context, we wish to emphasize the need to improve\nthe methods and procedures of work of the Council to\nensure enhanced transparency and wider involvement in\nthe decision-making process. The comprehensive paper\nsubmitted by the Non-Aligned Movement on 11 March\n1997 to the Working Group constitutes an appropriate\nbasis for working out an agreement on the procedures to\nbe adopted and incorporated into the rules of procedure of\nthe Council.\nAs we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury, our world is witnessing the emergence of a\nmultitude of problems and issues whose implications\ntranscend national and geographical boundaries. Their\ninherent dangers can threaten national and international\nsecurity. Unless curbed, such hazards will undermine the\nachievements made thus far in the environmental, social\nand economic spheres. Among such problems \u2014 without\nbeing exhaustive \u2014 are terrorism, the arms race, narcotic\ndrugs, environmental degradation, poverty, human rights\nviolations, massacres and genocide.\n17\n\n\nIn this context, Kuwait wishes to reaffirm its\ncategorical denunciation and rejection of all forms of\nviolence and terrorism, irrespective of their source. We\nsupport all collective international efforts to confront this\nphenomenon, including the apprehension and trial of the\nperpetrators of these crimes. Kuwait condemns the terrorist\nacts perpetrated against the United States embassy buildings\nin Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam last August and extends\nheartfelt condolences and sympathy to the families of the\nvictims of those tragic incidents.\nIn the area of disarmament, we welcome the progress\nmade thus far with regard to the Convention on the\nprohibition of chemical weapons, the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction.\nWhen we in Kuwait talk about landmines, we have in\nour minds the bitter memory of the destructive impact of\nthe millions of mines planted throughout Kuwait by the\ninvading Iraqi forces. Those mines claimed the lives of\nhundreds of innocent children, women and elderly people.\nIt took painstaking efforts, in which many States\nparticipated, to remove those mines. Kuwait had to expend\ngreat efforts and vast sums on the clearance operations.\nWe therefore call on the international community to\npursue its efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines. Kuwait\nalso encourages the movement towards curbing the arms\nrace and developing controls and rules that contribute to\ntension reduction in all volatile and conflict-ridden regions,\nespecially the Middle East, South Asia and the Indian\nsubcontinent.\nA significant development in international efforts to\ncombat crimes of genocide and massacres committed during\nconflicts and wars was the recent adoption of the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court in Rome last July. It is our\nhope that the Court will live up to the legitimate aspirations\nof the world community in trying all perpetrators of war\ncrimes or crimes against humanity and in serving as an\neffective deterrent against serious violations of international\nhumanitarian law.\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, Kuwait calls for\ngreater consolidation of international efforts, to ensure\nwider respect for and protection of the human rights\nconsecrated in the Charter of the United Nations and the\nUniversal Declaration. We maintain that it is the duty of\nall States, irrespective of their political, economic or\ncultural systems, to protect and promote those rights, with\na view to ensuring the dignity of the human being and his\nor her rights to freedom of expression and belief.\nIn the area of the fight against narcotic drugs, we\nbelieve that the efforts of the United Nations and of other\ncompetent international institutions to combat this\npernicious phenomenon, and to minimize the illicit sale,\ntrade and abuse of drugs should be supported and\nstrengthened. In this regard, we welcome the Political\nDeclaration adopted at the conclusion of the twentieth\nspecial session of the General Assembly, held last June.\nWe are hopeful that the steps agreed to then will be\ntranslated into effective concrete measures to stem the\ntide of this phenomenon, which poses severe threats to\nhuman health and to the dignity and aspirations of\nmillions of people and their families, as well as to the\nstability and independence of States.\nThe State of Kuwait has the honour of holding the\nchairmanship of the current session of the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC), which was established in\n1981. Since its inception, the GCC has been working\nsteadily to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of its peoples,\nwho share a common view of their destiny and future.\nLeaders of the GCC member States hold annual summits\nto examine and review a wide range of issues and events\nthat concern the family of the GCC community and have\nan impact on regional security and stability.\nA major issue on the agenda of the summit\nconferences in this regard is the implementation by Iraq\nof its obligations set forth in the Security Council\nresolutions relating to its invasion of the State of Kuwait.\nTherefore, the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders attached\ngreat importance to this question in their last summit,\nheld in December 1997 in Kuwait. The final statement\nissued by that summit reflected a Gulf vision of the future\nmodalities for establishing peace and stability in the\nregion. It also outlined the conditions that must be met by\nIraq in order to enable it to reclaim its normal position\nwithin the ranks of the international community. Let me\ncite the following excerpt from the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil summit statement:\n\u201cThe Supreme Council reaffirms the necessity for\nthe Government of Iraq to implement all relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions without selectivity,\nespecially those relating to the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction that remain in Iraq?s\n18\n\n\npossession, the release of Kuwaiti and third country\nprisoners, the return of all Kuwaiti property and\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 949\n(1994) by refraining from any act of aggression or\nprovocation against neighbouring States. It also\nstresses that the invasion and occupation of the State\nof Kuwait by Iraq was a breach of inter-Arab and\ninternational treaties. Therefore, Iraq must solemnly\nacknowledge that by its occupation of the State of\nKuwait, it violated the Charter of the League of Arab\nStates, the Joint Arab Defence Treaty and the Charter\nof the United Nations. The Supreme Council invites\nIraq to take the necessary steps to demonstrate its\ngood intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other\nStates in the region in both word and deed, with a\nview to sparing the region the horrors of another\nsimilar catastrophe and to ensuring security and\nstability for all States of the region. It reaffirms its\nsupport for the United Nations Special Commission in\ncharge of the elimination of Iraq?s weapons of mass\ndestruction, and for its Executive Chairman, with the\nintention of enabling it to fulfil its mandate, and\ninvites the Government of Iraq to cooperate in earnest\nwith the Special Commission without any restrictions\nor conditions. It stresses the need for Iraq to carry out\nall relevant Security Council resolutions with a view\nto mitigating sanctions and alleviating the suffering of\nthe Iraqi people, a suffering with which member\nStates of the Supreme Council are sympathetic, thus\nprompting them to welcome the oil-for-food formula\nas a means of providing food and medical drugs to the\nbrotherly people of Iraq. It reaffirms its firm position\nthat the independence, sovereignty, unity and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq must be preserved.\u201d\nIn addition to this crystal clear position of the Gulf\nCooperation Council countries, the Non-Aligned Movement,\nat its recent summit in South Africa, underscored the need\nfor Iraq to complete its implementation of all relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. The same call was made\nearlier by the leaders of the Muslim countries when they\nconvened their summit meeting in Tehran last December.\nDespite those legitimate demands and sincere calls to\nIraq to respond favourably to and to put into effect the\nresolutions of international legitimacy, Iraq still persists in\ndisregarding those calls and in challenging the Security\nCouncil resolutions. It claims that it has carried out what it\nis required to do. How can such claims be reconciled with\nthe fact that until now we have not yet heard from Iraq any\ndeclaration or seen any initiative suggesting that it regrets\nwhat it has done? In fact, convenient selectivity is the\ndominant feature of Iraq?s approach in addressing the\nresolutions and demands of international legitimacy. The\nmost recent crisis is perhaps a good example of the\nGovernment of Iraq?s procrastination and its breach of\nSecurity Council resolutions and of the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding it signed with the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations. Such crises, which are periodically\ntriggered by the Iraqi Government in its attempts to\ndisavow and circumvent its legal obligations, have all\nfailed thanks to the solid coherence and unity of position\nof the members of the Security Council, which insist on\nfull compliance by Iraq with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. There is no doubt that all these crises\nunfortunately contribute to the prolongation of the\nsanctions, for which the Government of Iraq alone bears\nresponsibility.\nAccordingly, we call upon the international\ncommunity to maintain its pressure on Iraq in order to\nforce it to comply with all relevant resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy, to release all Kuwaiti prisoners\nand other detainees and to account for the missing\npersons. This is a long-standing humanitarian problem. Its\ncontinuation causes more pain and suffering for the\naffected families and the people of Kuwait, who remain\nhopeful for the return of their loved ones. It is our hope\nthat this question will be resolved once and for all, in\naccordance with the traditions of Islam and the provisions\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThe events of the past two decades in the Arabian\nGulf region have demonstrated the need for building a\nregional system on the basis of full and mutual respect for\nthe principles of sovereignty of all States, non-\ninterference in the domestic affairs of others, non-use or\nthreat of use of force, the right of each State to choose its\nown political, economic and social system, the\nsovereignty of each State over its natural resources and\nthe importance of resort to peaceful negotiation for the\nresolution of disputes which may arise between them.\nHaving said that, and in view of Kuwait?s belief in\nthe inalienable rights of our sister State of the United\nArab Emirates to the three islands of Greater Tunb,\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, we wish to reaffirm our\ncommitment to and support for the final statement issued\nby the Kuwait summit of Gulf Cooperation Council\nmember States last December.\nKuwait follows with great interest and concern the\nrisks of the current stalemate in the Middle East peace\nprocess, which may threaten it with collapse and complete\n19\n\n\nfailure due to the intransigent policies of the present Israeli\nGovernment, which persists in rejecting the implementation\nof accords concluded with the Palestinian National\nAuthority and disclaiming the operational principles and\nframework of the entire peace process, primarily Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\nprinciple of land for peace. This provocative policy which\nis pursued by Israel?s Government not only undermines the\npeace process but also creates a general sense of despair\nand frustration. It also destroys all efforts to build mutual\nconfidence between the parties concerned. It is a push\ntowards confrontation, tension, violence and instability\nthroughout the region.\nTherefore, we demand that the Israeli Government halt\nits illegal policy of constructing settlements, confiscating\nland and demolishing houses. Israel should also cease\ntaking unilateral measures to create faits accomplis on the\nground inside the occupied territories. Instead, Israel should\nimplement the United Nations resolutions and fulfil its\npledges and accords signed with the Palestinian Authority\nwithin the framework of the peace process with a view to\nensuring the attainment of all legitimate political rights of\nthe Palestinian people, including its right to self-\ndetermination and to the establishment of its independent\nstate on its national territory with Jerusalem as its capital.\nHere, we stress the need to halt the unabating Israeli\nmeasures aimed at changing the physical features of the\ncity of Jerusalem and transforming its legal status. We\ncondemn the Israeli Government?s decision last June to\nexpand the municipal boundaries of the Holy City. We call\nupon the United Nations and the international community\nto fulfil their legal and political obligations in order to force\nIsrael to comply with Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions on Jerusalem and to preserve its\nArab, Muslim and religious character.\nIn the same vein, we renew our call to the two\nsponsors of the peace process, especially the United States,\nto redouble their efforts to salvage the peace process and to\nbring pressure to bear on Israel to resume negotiations on\nthe Syrian-Israeli track from the point at which they\nstopped, with a view to ensuring full Israeli withdrawal\nfrom the occupied Syrian Arab Golan, as well as its\ncomplete and unconditional withdrawal in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) from southern\nLebanon and the western Bekaa.\nIndeed, durable, just and comprehensive peace based\non United Nations resolutions and the land-for-peace\nprinciple is the only guarantee for meeting the aspirations\nof the peoples of the region for a new era of peaceful\ncoexistence and accelerated economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe tragic situations that prevail in Somalia and\nAfghanistan as a result of civil and ethnic conflicts that\nbrought suffering to their peoples cause us concern.\nKuwait, by virtue of its historical bonds with these two\ncountries, reiterates its appeals to all warring parties and\nfactions there to put an end to acts of violence and\nsenseless bloodshed. We call upon them to respond\nimmediately to regional and international appeals and\ninitiatives for dialogue and negotiation in order to resolve\ntheir differences and to achieve overall national\nreconciliation. This would allow them to channel their\npotentialities towards the goals of development and the\nreconstruction of what these conflicts have destroyed.\nIn condemning the killing of the Iranian diplomats\nin Afghanistan, Kuwait would like to extend its sincere\ncondolences to the people and the Government of the\nIslamic Republic of Iran and to the families of the victims\nof this tragic incident.\nWe appeal to both the Islamic Republic of Iran and\nAfghanistan to be calm, exercise self-restraint and resolve\ntheir disputes through dialogue and negotiation instead of\nconfrontation. While we appreciate the Government of\nIran?s ability to handle the crisis in a way that will spare\nthe two Muslim peoples the dire consequences of a war\nwhose consequences we cannot predict, Kuwait supports\nthe endeavours of the Security Council to achieve peace\nin the area.\nOn the international plane, while we applaud the\ninternational efforts to ensure full and strict\nimplementation of the Dayton accords to bring about\npeace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we regret\nthe aggressive practices of the Serb forces, including the\nsystematic uprooting and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of the\nMuslim population in the province of Kosovo. We urge\nthe international community to maintain its efforts to put\nan end to these inhumane practices in order to ensure the\nright of the native population of that province to a life of\ndignity and freedom.\nIn Africa, we are witnessing with deep regret the\ncontinuation of conflicts and civil wars in several States.\nThese hostilities jeopardize the security and stability of\nmany African States and strain their much needed\nenergies and resources. Kuwait supports the efforts of the\ninternational community to bring about peace and security\n20\n\n\nand to provide the means that help the African peoples and\nStates to achieve their aspirations for economic\ndevelopment and to overcome the problems and difficulties\nthat they face in various fields. We also welcome the role\nplayed by the Security Council in examining the situation\nin the African continent on a periodic basis. Furthermore,\nwe commend President Nelson Mandela for the role that he\nassumed in this regard as Chairman of the Non-Aligned\nMovement.\nThe world economic scene is currently going through\nsevere turbulence and turmoil that have touched off and\nworsened economic and social crises in many countries,\nespecially the developing ones. The major threat to the\nworld economy is no longer represented by inflation, but by\nrecession, stagnation and unemployment. Therefore, we call\nfor concerted international action to redress those\ndifficulties, which have adverse implications for everybody.\nNational plans and programmes capable of addressing the\nunderlying causes of these volatile situations should be\nestablished, and help with economic aid to the affected\nStates should be forthcoming from international monetary\ninstitutions in order to help them rectify their economic\nsystems and restore their vitality.\nIn this regard, Kuwait, for its part, continued to\nprovide economic assistance by financing many\ndevelopment projects in the developing countries through\nthe Kuwait fund for development, despite the adverse\nimpact on our economy of depressed oil prices, which\nplummeted this year to their lowest levels.\nAdherence to the noble goals and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, action in accordance with its\nprovisions and the common endeavour to promote and\nbolster them are essential for strengthening the United\nNations capabilities for facing the challenges of the next\ncentury. This will also help us in the crystallization of a\nnew world order in which dialogue and cooperation can\nprevail, and in which conflicts and hostilities would\ndisappear. It would also encourage active participation by\nall in strengthening the pillars of peace and stability, in\nconsolidating all efforts for the enrichment of human\ncivilization and in the fulfilment of the aspirations of all\npeoples for peace, security, freedom and justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to extend my\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his well-\ndeserved election to the presidency of the fifty-third session\nof the General Assembly. His recognized skills as a veteran\ndiplomat and his extensive knowledge of international\naffairs augur well for the success of our deliberations.\nAs we assure him of our complete cooperation, my\ndelegation would like to wish him every possible success.\nI should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, for the crucial role that he has played in the\npreservation of peace and the promotion of socio-economic\ndevelopment throughout the world. We are extremely\ngrateful to him for the laudable efforts he has made in the\nfirst two difficult years of his term.\nIn the past year, the world situation has continued to\nundergo changes that are more profound and complex than\nin the preceding years. World peace continues to be just\nas fragile. In various regions of the world, civil wars,\nconflicts among States, border disputes and ethnic, tribal\nand religious confrontations continue to take place. Some\nof these events offer no glimmer of abatement, while\nothers have been deliberately provoked against the\nsovereignty of other States. In the face of this situation,\nit is important for the international community, in its\nrespect for the Charter of the United Nations, to focus its\nenergies and do its utmost to reduce tensions and assist\nthe countries concerned in resolving their problems by\nmeans of negotiations, thus favouring the current general\ntrend towards international cooperation for development.\nOn the eve of the third millennium, States and peoples\nthroughout the world should together endeavour to lay the\nappropriate solid foundations to construct a new era of\nrelations based on peace, social justice and equality.\nIn certain regions of Europe, there has been a\nresurgence of deadly ethnic conflicts, resulting in\nenormous losses in human lives and material property.\nWhile coming out in favour of the inviolability of\ninternationally recognized borders, we should like\nsincerely to appeal to the countries involved to show\nrestraint and resolve their conflicts through dialogue.\nIn Africa, we are still witnessing ethnic\nconfrontation, civil war and border conflicts that continue\ngravely to threaten peace, stability and cooperation. In\nview of the great suffering that the victimized peoples of\ncertain countries of the region must ensure, the\ninternational community must render its support and\nassistance to the countries concerned in their efforts to\nresolve their problems by peaceful means and as soon as\npossible.\nIn the Caribbean, an atmosphere of peace and\ncooperation continues to prevail. In this context, we\nprofoundly regret that the 30-year-plus economic,\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed on the\nRepublic of Cuba by the United States of America has\nnot yet been lifted. In the interest of regional and world\npeace as well as in the interest of both the Cuban and\nAmerican people, it is our hope that the two countries\nconcerned will commit themselves to reasonable\nnegotiations so as to resolve their dispute as soon as\npossible in conformity with the general trend obtaining\nthroughout the world.\nIn the Middle East, the situation appears tense. The\npeace process begun following the signature by the\nPalestine Liberation Organization and Israel of the\n13\n\n\nWashington Accords of 1993 has run up against grave\ndifficulties in the past two years in the wake of the\nestablishments of new settlements in Har Homa in East\nJerusalem and of other unilateral measures that have been\ntaken. In our view, it is imperative for the parties involved\nimmediately to put an end to unilateral measures and\nspeedily to restore a climate of mutual trust and continue\nseriously in their negotiations to achieve a general\nsettlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973) and other relevant General Assembly\nresolutions in order to contribute to the restoration of peace,\nsecurity and cooperation in this very delicate region of the\nworld.\nOn the Korean peninsula in general we are witnessing\na reduction in tension. Contacts and talks among the parties\nconcerned are continuing in a spirit of respect for mutual\ninterests. While welcoming the efforts deployed, the\nGovernment and people of the Lao People\u00e2s Democratic\nRepublic would like to reiterate their sincere support for the\nprofound aspirations of the Korean people to live in peace\nand to achieve the peaceful reunification of their cherished\nhomeland.\nIn South-East Asia multifaceted beneficial cooperation\namong States is continuing under good conditions.\nNevertheless, in the wake of the financial crisis that\noccurred more than a year ago, the countries of the region\nare now going through unprecedented grave economic\ndifficulties. But thanks mainly to national efforts and\nregional and international cooperation, these countries are,\nthrough adjustment programmes, engaged in a process of\nprofound economic restructuring in order to get back on\ntrack. The international community as a whole has been\ncalled upon to support them actively, particularly those\nmost affected.\nAnother important event that has characterized our\nregion was the holding last July of general elections in\nCambodia, the results of which have been recognized and\napproved by the international community. As a nearby\nneighbour, the Lao People\u00e2s Democratic Republic would\nlike to express the hope that the Cambodian parties\nconcerned will speedily form a coalition Government\nwhich, in accordance with the Constitution, will be headed\nby a prime minister from the party that has been elected by\nmajority which would contribute to the establishment of\nnational concord in Cambodia and the promotion of peace\nand stability in the region.\nIn the Lao People\u00e2s Democratic Republic, socio-\npolitical stability continues to be securely guaranteed. In\naccordance with the Constitution, national legislative\nelections took place on 21 December 1997. The new\nNational Assembly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Fourth Legislature \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has been\nset up and is made up of 99 members, including 21\nwomen, representing the three major ethnic groups of the\ncountry.\nIn the economic sphere, the implementation of a\nrecovery policy based on market mechanisms has\nproduced generally satisfactory results. However, the\nmonetary crisis that has severely afflicted all of South-\nEast Asia and even beyond for more than a year has\nconsiderably affected our economy. But, resolutely basing\npolicies on the principle of self-reliance and enjoying\nexternal cooperation, the Lao Government has mobilized\nall of its capacity in human, intellectual, natural and\nmaterial resources to reduce to the minimum the adverse\neffects of this crisis on our society and to achieve\nnormalization.\nWhile some can gain in this era of globalization and\neconomic liberalization, the fact is that most developing\ncountries, particularly the least developed, have been\nlargely marginalized and exposed to enormous difficulties\nand risks. In this context, the developed countries must do\neverything possible to render the necessary assistance to\nthese countries so that they might catch up in their\nlagging development and have a share in the progress of\nthe times.\nDrug abuse continues to figure prominently on the\ninternational agenda. In this connection, the Government\nof the Lao People\u00e2s Democratic Republic has taken the\nnecessary measures with a view to reducing production\nand banning the illicit trafficking in drugs, opium in\nparticular. The results of these measures are satisfactory.\nHowever, the illegal introduction of synthetic drugs from\nabroad is still our main concern. In this connection, we\nwelcome the unanimous adoption by the General\nAssembly at its twentieth special session of the Political\nDeclaration and a programme of action, and we express\nthe hope that the international community as a whole will\nmobilize itself and marshall the necessary financial\nresources to implement this ambitious programme.\nThe question of human rights is no less important in\nmy country. Thus, on the occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, my Government has officially announced the\nestablishment of a national committee to commemorate\nthis day solemnly on a wide scale with the sole purpose\nof publicizing the contents of the Declaration among the\n14\n\n\nmulti-ethnic Lao people and to promote harmony and\nmutual respect in our society.\nThe world today is confronted with numerous\nchallenges. World peace remains fragile. Under-\ndevelopment, poverty, hunger and disease are among the\npriority problems that must be resolved. With the purpose\nof consolidating peace and achieving development\nthroughout the world, the United Nations, our only\nuniversal multilateral forum, must make an important\ncontribution. To be able to fulfil its mission in this new era,\nour Organization needs to restructure itself or to reorganize\nitself to be more effective.\nIn this connection, we would like to express our great\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\nreform initiatives he presented last year. Of course, these\nreforms which must, inter alia, stress the strengthening the\nrole of the Organization and the promotion of development,\nrepresent an ongoing and difficult process. But in order for\nthem to succeed, a solid financial basis must be assured. In\nthat vein, it is high time that, in conformity with the United\nNations Charter, all the Member States, particularly the\nmain contributors, fulfil their financial commitments in full\nand on time. In so doing, we are giving the incipient\nreforms a chance, and in the final analysis we would be\ninfusing energy into our Organization so that it could\ndischarge its lofty mission as it confronts the challenges of\nour times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation,\nI extend to you, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your\nelection to the high post of President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. We wish you every\nsuccess in discharging your very responsible mission.\nI would also like to express my profound\nacknowledgement to the President of the General Assembly\nat its previous session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who also\nhappens to be my predecessor as Ukraine?s Foreign\nMinister, for his efficient and fruitful work here. I believe\nthat the results of the fifty-second session deserve our\npositive evaluation, for they gave a strong impetus to the\nprocess of a wide-scale reshaping and strengthening of the\nUnited Nations. The last session will undoubtedly enter\nhistory as the session of reform. I am very pleased to note\nthat many previous speakers have attributed those\nachievements to a large extent to the skilful and fair\npresidency of the Ukrainian representative. This provides\nundeniable evidence that our nation is not only a consistent\nsupporter of, but also an active participant in, the process\naimed at reforming the Organization.\nMay I also applaud Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\nwhose tireless efforts to initiate and promote this\nchallenging goal deserve not only words of praise but,\nfirst and foremost, our active support.\nThe efficiency of the future functioning of the\nUnited Nations will be determined by its ability to\nrespond adequately to the challenges confronting\nhumanity at the start of the twenty-first century. The\npromotion of an interrelated and integral world, the search\nfor universal human harmony, the protection and further\ndevelopment of the values of our civilization, and free\naccess to them \u2014 these are the main priorities on which\nthe United Nations should concentrate its authority and\nattention.\nIt is widely acknowledged that the main feature of\nthe present development of the world community is the\nglobalization of political, social, economic and\nhumanitarian life. The advanced development of\ninformation and communication technologies and the\ninterdependence of the economic progress of countries,\nwith their closely interwoven market of goods, capital and\nlabour, bring together local processes, separate events,\nStates and international institutions into a worldwide\nnetwork. A great advantage of globalization is the\npossibility of resolving problems of individual regions and\ncountries by using the world?s experiences and the\napproaches that have proved to be most efficient.\nOn the other hand, recent years have been marked\nby some of the adverse effects of globalization. The\nfinancial crisis in Asia and Russia, whose repercussions\nhave been acutely felt all over the world, has become a\nsubject of special preoccupation in almost every country.\nIn this regard, Ukraine fully shares the view that the\nsocial and economic impact of globalization should\nbecome a top priority on the agenda of the world\ncommunity today.\nThe United Nations, which bears responsibility for\ninternational stability and sustainable economic\ndevelopment, has to find the means and tools that could\nhelp overcome the negative impact of globalization. In\nthis respect, I wish to recall and reiterate the initiative of\nthe President of Ukraine, officially announced in this Hall\nin 1995, to establish a new United Nations economic\nsecurity council. In the meantime, Member States could\nalso entrust the Security Council with additional\nassignments and the responsibility to deal with economic\nand social challenges that have direct repercussions for\ninternational peace and security.\n18\n\n\nFurthermore, there are other issues which cause\ndiscord and division among nations. These are the problems\nof national minorities, deported peoples, refugees, the\nspread of terrorism and organized crime, illicit drug-\ntrafficking and money-laundering.\nThese challenges require greater responsibility on the\npart of individual countries and their leaders for their own\npolicies, as well as concerted efforts by the world\ncommunity to counteract them. All that means that the\nUnited Nations, as never before, faces the urgent task of\nharmonizing all human and national interests and creating\na world order whereby a national idea is not opposed to\nglobal solutions. Hence, Member States should care more\nfor regional and universal security in order to maintain\npeace and stability without prejudice to their national\ninterests.\nEvents of last summer once again highlighted the issue\nof nuclear non-proliferation as pivotal for the world\ncommunity. This issue remains a cornerstone and\nfundamental principle of preserving the world from a global\nconflict. Nuclear tests conducted by two nations in\nconfrontation testify to the increasing urgency of expediting\nthe entry into force of international agreements in the field\nof nuclear disarmament, as well as the need to ban other\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe issue of nuclear disarmament and non-\nproliferation has a special meaning for Ukraine as a nation\nwhich inherited the world?s third largest nuclear arsenal and\nvoluntarily renounced it and which suffered from the largest\ntechnogenic disaster of this century in Chernobyl. Ukraine\nhas made an unprecedented and exemplary decision to\ninitiate the process of practical nuclear disarmament, and it\nstrictly honours its obligations undertaken in this field. That\nis why we believe that we have the moral right to urge\nother countries, first and foremost nuclear ones, to pursue\nfurther reductions and, in the long run, to destroy totally\ntheir nuclear potentials. We also call upon the so-called\nthreshold nations to abandon their nuclear ambitions.\nThe world community should take effective measures\nto create reliable mechanisms for the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and control over the\nimplementation of relevant international agreements. The\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nis in fact the only internationally binding document that\nconsolidates the world community around the concept of\nglobal security. Hence, we have to substantially revitalize\nthe efforts of the United Nations and the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for its support.\nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), signed\nby most United Nations Member States, is also of\nexceptional significance. Ukraine, as one of its first\nsignatories, calls upon the States which hesitate to accede\nto it to make this document effective as soon as possible.\nAs a positive example, it is worthwhile to note the recent\nsigning of the CTBT by Brazil and Spain. We welcome\nthis important decision by these two friendly countries.\nFor many years, the Conference on Disarmament has\nbeen playing an important role as a catalyst in freeing\nhumanity from the burden of armaments, first and\nforemost, the nuclear ones. Ukraine, which a few years\nago joined that body as a full member, continues to\ncontribute to the success of its activity. I am glad to\nmention that it was under the presidency of Ukraine?s\nrepresentative at the Conference that the elaboration of\nthe treaty of the prohibition of fissile material reached its\nfinal stage. As other priorities for the Conference, we are\nconsidering elaboration of a programme of global nuclear\ndisarmament and of a multilateral agreement on granting\nsecurity guarantees to non-nuclear nations by the nuclear\nPowers.\nThe contemporary age which has replaced the period\nof global confrontation has set new challenges before the\nUnited Nations in the field of international security. These\ninclude the growing numbers of local, mostly inter-ethnic\nconflicts inside countries, which cause civil wars and\ninvolve other nations. Moreover, these conflicts spread\nacross regions or even turn into major international\nconflicts and become the source of global instability. We\nare deeply convinced that the international community\nmust not be reconciled to the age of \u201ccold war\u201d being\nreplaced by the age of \u201chot peace\u201d. Finding an adequate\nremedy to these dangerous phenomena is one of the main\nissues that the United Nations should address today.\nUkraine, with a population of over 50 million\ncomprising 100 nationalities, has always pursued the\npolicy of maintaining stability and social accord in its\nsociety. For seven years of its independent existence, our\ncountry, contrary to pessimistic predictions, has succeeded\nin avoiding ethnic tensions, regional division or\nfragmentation of the society. This has been possible\nthanks to the persistent efforts of all branches of State\npower aimed at the comprehensive development of\ndemocratic institutions and legal protection of national\nminorities. This policy is enshrined in the Constitution of\nUkraine that was adopted two years ago.\n19\n\n\nConflict prevention remains one of the biggest\nchallenges for the United Nations, especially the Security\nCouncil. It requires constant attention to potential sources\nof tension and immediate and adequate measures to prevent\nthese tension points from growing into bigger conflicts. In\nthis context, I would like to underscore the pressing need\nfor strengthening the mechanism of United Nations global\nmonitoring and early warning of threats to international\npeace and security in order to facilitate the Security\nCouncil?s readiness for a timely and efficient response.\nAn important role in this respect is played by\ninternational sanctions which make it possible to exert\npressure without resorting to force. We believe, however,\nthat the mechanism of introducing sanctions requires\nserious improvement. First of all, there is urgent need to\nwork out an efficient tool for compensation for losses\nincurred by third countries observing the sanctions.\nRegrettably, all previous resolutions adopted by the General\nAssembly to assist such countries so far remain\nunimplemented, leaving some countries of Central and\nEastern Europe, in particular, to cope on their own with\ntheir uncompensated economic losses.\nIt is a recognized fact that peace and stability on the\nEuropean continent are an inseparable part of the global\nsecurity system. Ukraine views the future architecture of\nEuropean security as one based on the principles of\ncomprehensiveness, indivisibility and partnership. This\nfundamental position determines our country?s active\ncooperation with European and Euro-Atlantic security\nstructures, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nand the Western European Union. Ukraine also actively\nadvocates the further strengthening of the role of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) as an important all-European tool for safeguarding\nstability on the continent by means of political mediation,\nprotection of human and minorities? rights, strengthening of\ndemocracy and humanitarian activity. Closer cooperation\nand coordination of efforts between the United Nations and\nthe OSCE should be established by making it a good\npractice to organize regular meetings between senior\nofficials of the two organizations.\nFor Ukraine, a country of Central and Eastern Europe,\nestablishment of friendly and partnership relations with its\nneighbours is of great importance. In line with this policy,\nlast June Kiev hosted the first round of expert consultations\namong a number of Black Sea States to work out joint\nconfidence-building and security measures in the naval\nmilitary field in the Black Sea region. Thus, actively\nshaping a favourable security environment, Ukraine is\nasserting itself as a natural strategic link between various\nregions, for the North and South, East and West. That is\nwhy it was not accidental that the initiative of Ukraine?s\nPresident Leonid Kuchma to convene in September 1999\nin Yalta an international summit conference entitled \u201cThe\nBaltic-Black Sea Cooperation: towards an integrated\nEurope of the twenty-first century without dividing lines\u201d\nhas received broad support.\nContributing to the solution of vital global issues by\nfostering internal harmony in society, projecting stability\non its environment through its active participation in non-\nproliferation and peacekeeping, by shaping a vast network\nof regional cooperation, Ukraine, as one of the United\nNations founding members, gives top priority to\nstrengthening international peace and security and aspires\nto be elected next year as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council for the period 2000-2001.\nThis year the world community is marking the\nfiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping\nactivities. Over past decades, peacekeeping operations\nhave grown into an effective instrument of preventing the\nescalation of armed conflicts. While it is true that not all\nof the United Nations peacekeeping missions have been\nequally successful, the overall evaluation of United\nNations activities in this field should be considered\npositive. Despite enduring hardship conditions, and often\nat risk to their health and even their lives, the \u201cBlue\nHelmets\u201d courageously perform a noble mission of\nbringing peace to peoples in the planet?s trouble spots. In\nthis regard, I have the honour to propose that the\nAssembly adopt at the special commemorative meeting to\nbe held on 6 October a declaration in commemoration of\nthose who served in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations, an idea initiated by Ukraine.\nThe recent practice of peacekeeping in various\nregions of the world demands the development of a\ncomprehensive basic document comprising the conceptual\nprinciples of a new generation of peacekeeping\noperations. These principles should have an integrated\nblock of military, civil, humanitarian, political, legal and\nother aspects of such operations. We are convinced that\nstrengthening the United Nations peacekeeping potential\nshould become an integral component of the process of\nUnited Nations reform.\nIn this context, I should like to reiterate the need to\nreinforce the United Nations rapid reaction capabilities by\nperfecting the United Nations standby arrangements and\nmaking energetic efforts to set up the rapidly deployable\n20\n\n\nmission headquarters. Ukraine has made a practical\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations, in\nparticular in the former Yugoslavia and in some of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States countries. We are\nready to continue our active participation in peacekeeping\nand to commit additional resources to United Nations\nstandby arrangements.\nOur country supports all measures necessary to\nenhance the security of United Nations peacekeepers and\nmissions. In this regard, we call upon those States which\nhave not done so to accede to the Convention on the Safety\nof United Nations and Associated Personnel in order to\nfacilitate its entry into force as soon as possible.\nWhile globalization has become a driving force at the\ninternational level, and liberalization and economic reforms\na dominating tendency within nations, international\neconomic cooperation based on the principles of non-\ndiscrimination, fair competition, partnership and mutual\nbenefit has become increasingly relevant. The United\nNations should continue to play a leading role in creating\neffective mechanisms for such cooperation.\nWe believe that the Organization?s social and\neconomic activities should focus more on countries with\neconomies in transition to accelerate their integration into\nthe world economy. International assistance will be helpful\nfor a smoother conduct of economic reforms in such\ncountries and for overcoming the inevitable difficulties in\ntransforming national economies. Subsequently, these\nnations will achieve a level of economic development and\nthus be able to help other countries. The experience of\nsome countries of Central and Eastern Europe proves that\nsuch a prospect is quite possible.\nBased on this knowledge, Ukraine?s course towards\nthe complete and comprehensive integration of its national\neconomy into the European and global economic systems\nremains unchanged.\nI should like to place special emphasis on Ukraine?s\nstrategy of integration into the European Union, endorsed\nby the President of our country. This strategy provides for\nthe harmonization of national legislation and the intensive\ndevelopment of trade and economic relations with European\nUnion members based on the partnership and cooperation\nagreement that entered into force last March. I avail myself\nof this opportunity to commend the countries of the\nEuropean Union for their support, so clearly expressed by\nthe Austrian Presidency.\nWe attach great importance to the regional\ncomponent of international economic cooperation. Ukraine\nwas one of the initiators of the regional economic process\nwithin the framework of the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation (BSEC) and of the BSEC?s establishment as\na fully fledged international organization. We think that\ntoday the Black Sea Economic Cooperation organization\nhas full grounds for claiming observer status in the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThis year we are also marking another event of\nhistoric significance: the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which has\nbecome a milestone in the quest of the individual to find\nhis or her own identity in society. This Declaration\nprovided a powerful impetus to the development of the\ninternational system of protection of human rights, the\ncreation of the relevant branch of international law, and\nthe introduction of a ramified system of control over the\nfulfilment by States of their commitments in the field of\nhuman rights.\nThe Declaration remains a crucial element of all\nhuman rights activities within the United Nations and a\nmodel for constitutional practice in many parts of the\nworld. For instance, the Constitution of Ukraine, which\nprovides that safeguarding human rights and freedoms\nmake up the essence of national policy, is based on the\nhumanistic ideas of the Declaration.\nAn entire series of events dedicated to the fiftieth\nanniversary of this Universal Declaration is under way in\nUkraine. The most important of them was the\nInternational Conference organized early this month in\nYalta by our Government together with the United\nNations Development Programme, which was attended by\nrepresentatives from 27 countries and a number of\ninternational organizations; a booklet on that Conference\nhas been circulated to members. A new Yalta spirit\nassociated with the observance of human rights and\nfreedoms was proclaimed at the Conference. This spirit is\nbest protected in the context of the growing role of\ninternational law.\nI believe that it is a matter of honour for all States\nMembers of this Organization to strictly abide by their\ncommitments to the United Nations Charter and the\nfundamental principles of international law, in particular\nas regards respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, and the strengthening\nof the role of preventive diplomacy.\n21\n\n\nUkraine supports the proposals to strengthen the\nInternational Court of Justice, which reflects the increasing\ntendency to resolve international disputes by means of law.\nThe Security Council and other United Nations bodies\nshould consider making better use of the International\nCourt?s potential when dealing with international disputes.\nEqually important is the setting up of the International\nCriminal Court, which should be considered in the context\nof the global changes that have taken shape after the end of\nthe cold war. The importance of this international judicial\ninstitution is supported by the fact that its jurisdiction\ncovers the most serious crimes committed against\nhumankind.\nFollowing the recognized principle of pacta sunt\nservanda, Ukraine rigorously adheres to its commitments\nunder international instruments and to the standards and\nrules of its national legislation, which are applied in\naccordance with the norms of international law.\nThe decisions on United Nations reform adopted at the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly represent only\nan initial stage of the Organization?s sweeping\ntransformation. Painstaking work is needed to translate\nthem into practice so that the United Nations can enter the\nnew millennium renewed and able efficiently to address the\npersisting challenges of the present time.\nIt is therefore necessary to continue with wide-scale\nstructural adjustments and the reorganization of United\nNations programme activities to make them more results-\noriented, businesslike and tailored to the needs of the\nMember States.\nThe key issue in renewing the United Nations is the\nreform of the Security Council. Unfortunately, prompt\nresolution of this fundamental question does not appear to\nbe forthcoming, as the issue has obviously stagnated. It is\nin the interest of the international community as a whole to\nmake every effort to achieve a consensus decision on the\nreform of this important United Nations body. It is\nimpossible to imagine a reformed United Nations without\nthis crucial issue having been resolved.\nTo make decisive progress in shaping a more reliable\nand predictable world and promoting economic prosperity,\nsocial justice and ecological safety, we must demonstrate\nperseverance, courage and political will. Near-universal\nmembership, a far-reaching mandate, a broad spectrum of\nactivities and the institutionalized presence of the United\nNations at many levels can and should bring it to the\ncentre of these efforts.\nThe authority and efficiency of this world\nOrganization depend entirely on the membership. If we\nwish to see the United Nations truly reformed and\nrevitalized, we must prove it by our practical deeds. We\nmust prove that people can continue to rely on the United\nNations and that our Organization is prepared to respond\nto new challenges and withstand any tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I bring the Assembly\ngreetings from President Charles Taylor and the\nGovernment and the people of Liberia.\nOn behalf of the delegation of Liberia and in my\nown name, I convey my sincere congratulations to\nMr. Opertti on his assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. His unanimous\nelection to this high office is a credit not only to him but\nalso to his esteemed country. I assure him of my\ndelegation?s fullest support and cooperation and wish him\nevery success in the discharge of his duties.\nI should like also to register my delegation?s\nappreciation to the President?s distinguished predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the then Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Ukraine, for the able manner in which he\nconducted the work of the fifty-second session. The many\nsuccesses achieved during his tenure of office, especially\nin the reform of this Organization, attest to his diplomatic\nskills and his understanding of the problems which\nconfront the Organization and our determined efforts to\nbuild a more just and humane international order that is\nresponsive to the legitimate aspirations of all mankind.\nWe offer special thanks to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his unrelenting pursuit of the\nimplementation of the mandates entrusted to him by the\nAssembly. My delegation also commends him for his\nefforts aimed at the successful execution of the\nadministrative reforms of the Secretariat, and the\nimportant focus he has placed on development,\n\n\npeacemaking and peace-building efforts, especially in\nAfrica, as the most assured basis for sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Secretary-General?s report (A/52/871) on the\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa provides an in-depth\nanalysis of the social and economic ills of the Continent,\nwhich was thoroughly discussed at the ministerial meeting\nof the Security Council. We fully agree with his assertion\nthat while African Governments must ultimately be held\nresponsible for the problems confronting their countries,\nmeaningful steps must be taken by this Organization to lend\nsupport to national measures aimed at alleviating these\nproblems.\nIn this connection, it is notable that on 6 October\n1998, the United Nations will observe the fiftieth\nanniversary of the establishment of its peacekeeping\noperations. Africa continues to benefit from the United\nNations peacekeeping operations aimed at the resolution of\nconflicts on the continent pursuant to Chapter VIII of the\nCharter. While welcoming this cooperation, Liberia calls\nupon the Security Council to employ impartiality and non-\nselectivity in the execution of its primary role of\nmaintaining international peace and security.\nThe international political situation continues to be\ncharacterized by sustained efforts aimed at the maintenance\nof international peace and security. While there has been no\nmajor eruption of military confrontation between States,\nintra-State conflicts and civil wars in Angola, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, the\nSudan and Kosovo, and the territorial dispute between\nEthiopia and Eritrea have claimed the attention of regional\nand subregional organizations such as the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\nThese organizations and regional bodies are\nendeavouring, with the complementary support of the\nUnited Nations, to seek negotiated peaceful solutions and to\nminimize the humanitarian crises, refugee flows and\ninternal displacement caused by conflicts and wars.\nWith regard to the Middle East, my delegation is\ndeeply concerned about the lack of progress, particularly in\nconnection with the Madrid Conference and the Oslo\naccords. We are of the view that new initiatives should be\nundertaken to restart the peace process, focusing on the\nunderstanding reached by the parties. Liberia will support\nrenewed efforts by the international community that seek\nto bring the volatile situation in that region to a fair and\nequitable conclusion.\nThe rise in acts of terrorism threatens the\nindependence, sovereignty, freedom, economic and social\ndevelopment of all States. It cannot be overemphasized\nthat terrorism has no justification as a means to solve\npolitical differences. Therefore, the Government of\nLiberia strongly condemns the bombings in Dar-es-\nSalaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. It is imperative\nthat concerted actions be taken to combat this\nunwholesome phenomenon which has no bounds. Liberia\nis in accord with the proposal of President Hosni\nMubarak of Egypt for the convening of an international\nconference on terrorism to deliberate on the issue.\nThe world is faced with the frightening prospect of\nan increase in the number of States with nuclear\ncapability, as well as the proliferation of conventional\nweapons. We therefore call for more States to accede to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT). There is an urgent need to curtail the trafficking\nin small arms and to promote greater transparency in\narms transfers.\nThe scourge of the worldwide drug problem\nnecessitated the convening of the drug summit in New\nYork in June of this year. It is a source of concern that\ndrug sales have overtaken trade in other commodities, and\nthe money value of this illegal act has reached over $400\nbillion annually. My Government reaffirms its\ncommitment to tackling the drug problem within its\nborders and to cooperating at the regional and\ninternational levels in keeping with the Political\nDeclaration and the guiding principles outlined at the\nconclusion of the summit.\nThe 1990s have been declared an era of\nglobalization. However, the rapid growth of international\ntrade and financial flows has affected most economies in\nprofound ways. Globalization threatens the weak and\nvulnerable by marginalizing them in the global economic\nsystem.\nFor most developing countries, the debt overhang\nand unequal participation in the regulation of commodity\npricing, declining official development assistance and\ncapital flows are perennial problems that hamper their\neconomic development and integration into the world\n2\n\n\neconomy. My delegation therefore joins in the call for the\nindustrialized countries to bring about equity in the\nregulatory framework for the financial and exchange\nmarkets.\nIn this connection, Liberia reaffirms its support for the\nposition of the Non-Aligned Movement summit, held\nrecently in Durban, South Africa, that developed countries\nbe urged to accelerate the review of the world financial\nsystem, thus ensuring that capital flows were supportive of\nexpansion in trade, employment and development. In\naddition, there is the need to boost development aid from\nWestern countries and to remove restrictive conditions\nlinked to receiving international assistance.\nIn particular, my Government welcomes the call by\nPresident William Clinton of the United States of America\nfor a meeting in Washington, D.C., in mid-October of this\nyear, of finance ministers and central bank governors from\nnations of the G-7 and emerging economies to debate steps\nto shore up the tottering global financial system. His\nreaffirmation of this proposal, as well as his pledge made\nto this Assembly on 21 September last, to forge a\npartnership with Africa, deserves our commendation and\nsupport. Also, we cannot agree more with the Secretary-\nGeneral that the United Nations should be included in the\ndiscussion. Its participation will give more international\ncredibility to the decisions that would emerge from the\nmeeting.\nEven though recent indicators point to improvement in\nthe economies of several African countries, the vast\nmajority continue to experience negative growth. The\nlargest number of least developed countries are in Africa,\nand the crippling effects of the heavy external debt and\ndecline in investment and financial flows have been major\ncontributors to the poor economic performance of these\ncountries. There is a need for concerted international action\nto remedy this state of affairs. The United Nations system-\nwide support for the development of Africa is a step in the\nright direction.\nMy delegation welcomes the recent decision of the\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council,\nheld in July of this year, and the Council?s ministerial\ncommuniqu\u00e9 on market access for exports from least\ndeveloped countries, as well as capacity-building and in-\nservice infrastructure development. These decisions deserve\nfull support and should be implemented by Member States.\nIn this connection, the important initiative taken by the\nGovernment of Japan, a prominent member of the G-7, to\nurgently address Africa?s development has the highest\ncommendation of my Government and the appreciation of\nall African States. My delegation looks forward to\nactively participating in the important ministerial meeting\nwhich will be convened in Tokyo next month on Africa?s\neconomic recovery. Moreover, this initiative deserves the\nwholehearted support of Member States of this\nOrganization, particularly the developed countries.\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the efforts by\nthe United Nations to harmonize the issues of\ndevelopment and the environment. With respect to the\nenvironment, the decision reached on Agenda 21 during\nthe 1992 Rio Conference is the most comprehensive effort\nundertaken by the international community to raise\nawareness of the degradation of the environment and the\nneed to reverse the negative trend. We trust that the issue\nof the environment will remain a priority on the global\nagenda.\nOne important and unquestionable achievement for\nour Organization to celebrate is the great improvement in\nthe universal character of the Organization. Nevertheless,\nmore efforts must be deployed to ensure that every\ncountry becomes a member of this Organization. My\ndelegation believes that in that regard, the exceptional\nsituation of the Republic of China on Taiwan must be\nexamined with a view to the unification of the Chinese\npeople based on their own will and decision. However,\nwe also believe that it is the responsibility of this\nOrganization to provide the impetus for the unification of\nthe two Chinas. History is replete with examples of the\nmembership in this Organization of divided countries,\nwhere unification was peacefully settled under the aegis\nof the United Nations. We have confidence in the ability\nof the United Nations to allow history to be repeated on\na similar matter of grave importance to this Organization.\nIn the interest of equity and the maintenance of regional\npeace and security, my country calls for the parallel\nrepresentation in the United Nations of the People?s\nRepublic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nThe matter of reform is one that needs no\njustification. It is an imperative for the continued\nrelevance of the United Nations. An Organization made\nup of 185 Member States must, by its nature, allow fair\nplay and democracy to prevail, and not the rule of\nweighted influence. The tenets of the United Nations\nCharter do not submit to the principle of \u201cmight makes\nright\u201d, but to the enlightened principles of international\nlaw which emerge from the objective need for peaceful\ncoexistence. Unless the powerful States recognize this\n3\n\n\nimperative, the international system will move towards\ninternational anarchy rather than towards a more humane,\npeaceful and stable world order.\nThese reforms will be meaningless unless parallel\nreforms can be achieved within the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, the very essence of weighted and undemocratic\nglobal influence.\nOn the question of increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, Liberia reaffirms its support for an\nincrease for Africa and other under-represented regions on\nthe basis of equitable geographical representation, consistent\nwith the decisions of the Organization of African Unity and\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\nDuring the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly, it was my honour to read the prepared text of\nMr. Charles Taylor, President of the Republic of Liberia, to\nthis Assembly. At that time, only two months had passed\nsince his assumption of the leadership of Liberia, following\nseven years of civil war and the holding of democratic\nelections in the country.\nSince then, the Government has undertaken measures\ntowards the rebuilding of the country, national\nreconciliation, rehabilitation, repatriation and resettlement.\nIn light of this, from 19 July to 12 August 1998, the\npeople of Liberia participated in a national conference to\ndeliberate on the future of Liberia under the theme \u201cVision\n2024\u201d. This historic undertaking not only reaffirmed\nPresident Taylor?s commitment to participatory democracy\nbut also afforded a unique opportunity for Liberians at\nhome and abroad to freely deliberate on and propose\nsolutions for the building of a new Liberia.\nAt the conclusion of the conference, a commission\nwas established and given the responsibility to seek full\nimplementation of the decisions reached. Those decisions\nranged from decentralization of the Government to the\nenactment of legislation covering all facets of the society.\nMy Government has attached high priority to the\nimplementation of the decisions of the national conference,\nsince it has helped produce an agenda which complements\nthat of the Government and identifies issues and measures\nas well as courses of action that could be adopted for the\nstability and development of Liberia.\nPresident Taylor is aware that the key to Liberia?s\nstability and development lies in fostering genuine\nreconciliation among Liberians. A human rights\ncommission established since the inception of the\nGovernment continues to function. The protection of\nhuman rights will remain one of the cornerstones of\nLiberia?s domestic policy. This is why my Government\nhas now undertaken legislative action to ratify and accede\nto all human rights instruments as a concrete attestation\nof our commitment to promote and protect human rights\nin Liberia.\nConvinced that democracy is indispensable for\ndevelopment, the Government has also undertaken\nmeasures to realize its intention to build institutions to\nconsolidate the democratic process in the country. We\nhave encouraged the continued existence and growth of\nthe 13 political parties that participated in the last\nelections. We hold regular consultations with these parties\nconcerning national issues. We believe that these efforts\nare necessary for the dynamic development of a modern\nLiberia. Meanwhile, international support remains a\nnecessity in order for Liberia to find its way forward and\nconsolidate the gains made by the return to civilian,\nconstitutional rule.\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter vests the\nSecurity Council with the authority to decide what\nmeasures may be taken to maintain or restore\ninternational peace and security, following a determination\nof the existence of any threat to peace, breach of the\npeace or act of aggression.\nIn a number of cases, the imposition of a sanctions\nregime or embargo by the Council has yielded, with\nminimal collateral harm, the results for which punitive\nmeasures were authorized. However, in other cases,\nsanctions have led to grave and intolerable humanitarian\ncrises which have deprived large numbers of innocent and\nvulnerable persons, mainly women and children, of their\nmost basic needs, while not achieving their intended\nobjectives.\nWithin this context, the Government of Liberia\nbelieves that any sanctions regime should clearly define\nthe punitive measure, its specific target, a definite time-\nframe and exemptions to mitigate the unintended harmful\nconsequences for the whole population of a given country\nand those of contiguous States.\nIn 1992, during Liberia?s civil war, the ECOWAS\nsubregional grouping imposed an arms embargo on\nLiberia as a means to facilitate the peace process and\nreduce the level of violence. ECOWAS also further\n4\n\n\nappealed to the Security Council to facilitate the universal\napplication of the embargo, an appeal the Security Council\nheeded positively by adopting a resolution imposing an\narms embargo on Liberia.\nBy 1997, the Liberian civil war was brought to an end\nthrough the process of a negotiated political settlement,\ndisarmament, demobilization and the holding of free and\nfair democratic elections. After the inauguration of the\nelected and constitutional Government, ECOWAS lifted all\nsanctions and embargoes imposed against Liberia and called\nupon the international community to do the same.\nThe Government of Liberia, since its assumption of\noffice, has repeatedly called upon the Security Council to\nlift the arms embargo, an appeal that has fallen on deaf\nears. The Liberian Government has a constitutional\nresponsibility and a sovereign right to defend, protect and\npreserve the independence and territorial integrity of the\nRepublic.\nWe strongly believe that the arms embargo currently\nin force against Liberia is patently unfair since it is open-\nended and provides no criteria for the lifting of the\nembargo, as has been the procedure in other, similar cases.\nMoreover, the intent and purpose of the 1992 arms embargo\nhave been achieved by the peaceful resolution of the\nLiberian civil crisis through the holding of democratic\nelections in Liberia and the installation of the Government\nheaded by President Charles Taylor on 2 August 1997.\nAs a responsible member of the international\ncommunity, Liberia would accede to the wishes of the\nSecurity Council if it were decided that there was\njustification for the maintenance of sanctions against Liberia\nbased on concrete facts or a violation of international law\nor covenants. However, to do so under a sanctions regime\nthat no longer has validity is unwarranted and inimical to\nthe interests of the country.\nThe Government of Liberia requests that the Security\nCouncil take cognizance of Liberia?s legitimate aspirations\nand constitutional obligation to its people. It should be\nnoted that in spite of the support of the Liberian people for\ntheir Government, there may remain some disgruntled\ncitizens and external actors who seek to disturb the peace\nand reverse the progress achieved thus far by capitalizing\non the perceived inability of the Government to adequately\nprotect itself because of the present arms embargo on the\ncountry. For the Security Council to place a Member State\nof this Organization in such an untenable position is\ninimical to the interests of the Liberian Government and\npeople and inconsistent with the purposes and principles\nof the United Nations.\nThe Government of Liberia calls on the Security\nCouncil to impartially assume its responsibility under the\nCharter by expeditiously redressing what is considered to\nbe an injustice to Liberia by lifting its 1992 arms\nembargo, imposed on the country for the reasons already\nmentioned.\nAt the threshold of the twenty-first century, it must\nbe recognized that the full achievement of the goals and\nobjectives of this Organization has been largely\nundermined by the long period of the cold war. Its demise\nheld out the promise of a peace dividend that was to be\napplied to the development activities of the United\nNations.\nRegrettably, that is not the case today. However,\nwithin a renewed, principled spirit of interdependence, the\ninternational community can evolve an effective means of\npartnership and cooperation to achieve equity in the areas\nof economic development and social advancement as\nnecessary conditions for the maintenance of global peace\nand security.\nBy so doing, we will have crafted a workable agenda\nthat will propel the human family into the new\nmillennium with the hope of a just world order that is\nresponsive to the needs of all inhabitants of our common\nplanet, as envisaged in the Charter.\nLet me give the assurance that Liberia remains\ncommitted to this basic goal in the same determined\nmanner as when it signed the Charter of the United\nNations in 1945.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, Sir, to\nconvey, on behalf of my delegation, my warmest and\nmost heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. His election is a tribute to his country,\nUruguay, a country with which Cameroon shares many\ncommon ideals. It is also a mark of our confidence in his\nqualities as a diplomat and lawyer of renown. He can rest\nassured of the full cooperation of the delegation of\nCameroon in successfully discharging his important duty.\nI also pay a warm tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the former Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Ukraine, who discharged with effectiveness and\nauthority the delicate and high-profile mission with which\nhe was entrusted.\nFinally, I renew the firm support of my country,\nCameroon, for the work undertaken by the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at the head of\nthe Secretariat of our Organization since his election. He\nhas resolutely and effectively tackled the reform of the\nUnited Nations with discretion, tact and realism, so as to\nmake it capable of meeting the challenges facing it.\nAt a time of globalization and information\nsuperhighways, it is more urgent and necessary than ever\nto place the development and dignity of humankind at the\ncentre of our concerns. We must also acknowledge that\nthe tremendous technological advances at the end of this\ncentury justify high hopes of a better tomorrow.\nBy working for the right to development for both\npresent and future generations, by charting new and more\nsecure paths in the quest for peace, by watching over\ninternational security more effectively than in the past,\nour Organization is, at this delicate period in history,\nhelping to ease the anguish of humankind in an\ninternational environment that is increasingly complex,\nunequal and disquieting.\nIn this context, the current session of the General\nAssembly gains greater prominence and importance\nbecause it coincides with two fiftieth anniversaries: that\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that of\n9\n\n\nthe start of peacekeeping operations. Those two events will\nform the basis of my remarks.\nWith regard to the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the first words of the preamble retain, 50 years\nlater, striking relevance. It states:\n\u201crecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal\nand inalienable rights of all members of the human\nfamily is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace\nin the world\u201d.\nHuman rights are, first and foremost, a question of\ndignity: dignity for every human being; dignity for all of\nhumankind. We believe that this search for dignity, which\nis a condition for peace, justice and freedom in the world,\nis the common ideal towards which all human rights actions\nand activities should be aimed.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary is a\ntrue rallying call to us and should provide the international\ncommunity with an opportunity to refocus its approach to\nhuman rights questions, which remains very simplistic.\nIndeed, too often we forget that civil and political rights,\nwhich exercise the international community so much, can\nbe fully developed only if economic, social and cultural\nrights are also guaranteed. Recent experiences of\ndemocratization processes in Africa remind us, by their\nvery fragility, of the incontrovertible indivisibility,\nuniversality and interdependence of human rights.\nTo paraphrase the words the head of State of\nCameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, spoke at the\nWorld Food Summit in Rome, what dignity can there be for\nthe hungry? The international community must therefore\ngive equal priority to the promotion of the right to a\nminimum standard of living.\nIn a world in which the globalization of trade, instead\nof placing human beings at the centre of its concerns,\nmerely means speculation, market manipulation and deals\nthat generate the greatest profits, making the rich richer and\nreducing the poorest to destitution, the social environment\nitself is the cause of tension and conflict. That is why we\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his report (A/52/871),\nsubmitted to the Security Council as document S/1998/318\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\npeace and sustainable development in Africa.\nIn this context, it is apt that, in seeking to establish a\ntrue culture of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the\ninternational community has chosen the central theme of the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary to be \u201chuman\nrights for all\u201d.\nPoverty is today the most serious threat to human\ndignity. This is particularly true in Africa, which is the\nleast advanced region and the one most seriously affected\nby the economic crisis. Despite the reforms that have\ntaken place, at enormous social cost, to promote good\ngovernance, democracy and the liberalization of\neconomies, meeting basic needs remains for many a\nluxury in that continent. Whether we are talking about\naccess to drinking water, primary health care, or\neducation or about transport or other communication\ninfrastructures, international cooperation has not yet borne\nfruit in a reliable, continuing, predictable and effective\nway.\nOfficial development assistance, which elsewhere has\nhelped to give rise to decent standards of living, is\ndwindling drastically. Despite the increasingly favourable\njuridical environment offered by Africa, investors seem to\nbe losing interest in the region. The debt burden is getting\nworse. Our products do not have easy access to\ninternational markets, nor are they priced according to\ntheir true value.\nIt is clear that the marginalization of Africa seems\ninevitable unless a true spirit of solidarity quickly\nprovides real long-term solutions. It is time for the\nvarious initiatives, plans of action and other programmes\nadopted to benefit Africa to be translated into reality.\nBasing itself on the efforts made by the peoples of Africa,\nthe international community must increase its assistance\nto that continent so as to enable Africans themselves to\nmake the progress that is indispensable for developing\ntheir potential. In that way African countries will be able\nsuccessfully to integrate themselves into world economic\nnetworks and achieve the development to which they\nlegitimately aspire, despite the well-known geographical\nand historical handicaps. Such a development would\ninevitably benefit all of humankind.\nThis solidarity should take the specific form of\nreconsideration \u2014 indeed, the cancelling \u2014 of the debts\nof African countries. We should recall that decisions to\ncancel debt in the past have enabled countries in difficult\nand precarious situations to rediscover the road to\neconomic prosperity, democracy and greater political\nstability.\nThe path thus seems clearly laid out for the rich\ncountries that are working to promote freedom and human\n10\n\n\nrights. They should reflect, at the dawn of the third\nmillennium, on their relations with developing countries\nthat are becoming poorer because of their deep\nindebtedness.\nNorth-South solidarity should also be reflected in a\nnew concept of official development assistance. Such\nassistance is indispensable for establishing development\ninfrastructure within the context of poverty eradication.\nPrivate flows, channelled through non-governmental\norganizations, cannot alone take on that role. Furthermore,\nstructural adjustment should aim to strengthen and improve\nthe autonomous management capacity of countries in\ndifficulty. Otherwise, globalization will mean that certain\ncountries become richer while others become poorer. That\nwould render meaningless the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and put in grave danger the requirement of\ndignity for every human being, for all people and for peace\nin the world.\nIndeed, what freedom or self-determination \u2014 and\nespecially, what sovereignty \u2014 can there be for a starving\npeople? What democracy can there be for a people\nsuffering from malnutrition, with no access to basic health\ncare, drinking water or elementary education. We thus need\nto return the human being to the centre of development.\nCameroon has constantly contributed to this lofty\nendeavour.\nThe salient activities we have undertaken to mark the\nfiftieth anniversary in my country include informing people\nabout human rights and making all of society aware of\nhuman rights issues through media campaigns, seminars,\nconferences and poster campaigns throughout our land,\neven in villages; the introduction of human rights teaching\nin schools and universities; issuing special postage stamps;\npromoting in particular the rights of women, children and\ndisabled or infirm people, establishing a prize for the best\nresearch in the human rights area; and the opening by the\nhead of State of a public square dedicated to human rights.\nBut above and beyond commemorating the\nanniversary, Cameroon has for a decade been making\nimportant progress in promoting human rights. It did so\nfirst through a series of legislative and regulatory measures\nthat, inter alia, abolished legal exemptions, restored\nindividual and collective freedoms, put an end to censorship\nand ensured better protection for the interests of workers\nand vulnerable social sectors.\nThrough constitutional revision and a progressive\nelectoral system, we have established total adherence to the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and ensured the\nfull participation of our people in making political\nchoices. Furthermore, a national committee for human\nrights and freedoms was established in 1990, which is\nfreely carrying out its activities throughout the country, as\nare the many non-governmental organizations and human\nrights groups that have come into being.\nWith regard to progress made in the world since the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand the efforts that remain to be made in this area, there\nis no doubt that the promotion of and respect for human\nrights are a difficult, ongoing endeavour. Vigilance must\ntherefore be our watchword, and the struggle for human\nrights should not flag in any region of the world.\nThe United Nations must continue to ensure that\nhuman rights are fully enjoyed by all the peoples of the\nworld. To that end, the letter and spirit of the Universal\nDeclaration should gradually be adapted to changing\nmores and to science and technology. Bodies that are\nabove the fray of ideologies and interests should ensure\nthat it is observed, including through a system of regional\nand international human rights courts.\nWith regard to the fiftieth anniversary of\npeacekeeping operations, we wish to pay tribute to the\nwork done by the United Nations, which has always made\nits presence felt wherever peace has been threatened.\nThanks to the Blue Helmets, the United Nations is present\nin all the world\u2019s trouble spots, keeping the peace.\nIt is true that some voices have been heard here and\nthere deploring their sluggishness, hesitation and, in some\ncases the inaction. Sometimes the presence of a United\nNations force or mission has not been able to prevent\nlarge-scale massacres or crimes against humanity,\nperpetrated in violation of the most elementary rules of\nhumanitarian law. Such limits to the actions of our\nOrganization remind us in a very timely manner that the\nUnited Nations can act only within the limits of the\nmeans made available to it by the Member States. It is up\nto Member States, therefore, to provide it with the\nnecessary resources to enable it to respond fully to the\nmission entrusted to it by the peoples of the United\nNations.\nDespite these limits, we must acknowledge in a\npositive spirit that over the years many peacekeeping\noperations and other actions taken by the Secretary-\nGeneral have made it possible to prevent the emergence,\naggravation or continuation of many conflicts.\n11\n\n\nThanks to the Blue Helmets, millions of human lives\nhave been saved, and sometimes the United Nations has\npaid a heavy price for this total commitment to the cause of\npeace. The recent tragic death of Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye\nand his team, to whose memory I wish to reaffirm the\nfraternal homage of the people of Cameroon, is one more\nparticularly unhappy example of this point.\nBy ensuring the safety of peoples, the delivery of\nhumanitarian aid and respect for ceasefire agreements and\nby performing an increasing number of administrative tasks,\nthe Blue Helmets are helping restore confidence and\nprevent loss of life and the disintegration of certain States.\nSuch commitments and sacrifices deserve all our\nencouragement.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operations\nshould provide us with an opportunity to think about\nquestions relating to their continuation: problems of\nfinancing, the safety of personnel involved in the\noperations, the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations and\nethical issues.\nWith regard to the ethical issues, Cameroon believes\nthat it is time to formulate a code of conduct so that people\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations can remain, above\nall, protectors of human rights as well as true beneficiaries\nof them. Given the many tasks expected of these\noperations, it would be appropriate to review their range,\ntheir scope and the modalities governing them.\nEven now, as we congratulate the United Nations on\nits work for peace, conflicts are still destroying lives,\ntearing apart families and communities and placing at risk\nthe future of young generations throughout the world. The\nreports of the Security Council and of the Secretary-\nGeneral, which we receive on a regular basis, are\nparticularly important in this respect.\nThe resurgence of terrorism is another element of the\npicture, as we were recently reminded by the deadly attacks\nagainst the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-\nSalaam and the attack in Omagh. Cameroon, a peaceful,\njustice-loving country, strongly condemns these unfortunate\nevents that show that we need to redouble our efforts to put\nan end to mindless violence.\nThis means that we must silence weapons, prevent\ndisputes and above all create the conditions for true peace.\nThat does not mean merely the absence of armed\nconflict, but living together in harmony, with the entire\ninternational community and all nations building together\na society that respects individual and collective freedoms.\nWe need to begin by recognizing and accepting\ndifferences as a source of richness and dynamism. We\nneed to practise tolerance and dialogue, the latter not just\nbetween the citizens of one nation but also between\nStates, in order to build a more fraternal and democratic\nsociety.\nThis means in particular that we must opt to settle\ndisputes through peaceful means and that States must turn\nwhenever necessary to the International Court of Justice\nas the judicial organ of the United Nations and the\nessential cog not only in the machinery for peaceful\nsettlement of disputes, but also within the general system\nof peacekeeping and international security established by\nthe Charter.\nAt the end of the United Nations Decade of\nInternational Law, the call has become urgent for States\nto demonstrate themselves psychologically prepared to\nseek recourse naturally to the International Court of\nJustice and the political bodies of the United Nations and\nthose of regional organizations. This is Cameroon\u2019s\nconviction, as well as that of the General Assembly,\nwhich in resolution 3232 (XXIX), paragraph 6, reaffirmed\nthat,\n\u201crecourse to judicial settlement of legal disputes,\nparticularly referral to the International Court of\nJustice, should not be considered an unfriendly act\nbetween States.\u201d\nThat is why Cameroon went to the International\nCourt of Justice at The Hague with regard to its dispute\nwith Nigeria over territorial and maritime boundaries. In\nthis context, I should like to take this opportunity to make\nan urgent appeal to the international community, and\nespecially to the United Nations, to help keep the peace\nbetween our two countries before, during and after the\nCourt\u2019s verdict.\nSilencing weapons is a good thing; eliminating their\nuse through prevention and \u2014 why not? \u2014 through\ndisarmament is even better. That is why we must not rest\nuntil all weapons of mass destruction are eradicated, be\nthey of a nuclear, chemical, biological or other nature.\nIt must be pointed out here that another danger has\nappeared in certain subregions of Africa \u2014 namely, the\nproliferation of small arms and their illicit circulation.\nThis phenomenon is already a threat to peace and should\n12\n\n\nbe quickly contained because it can sow the seeds of\nconflict.\nThe conclusions of the recent seminar organized by\nthe United Nations Secretariat in Yaound\u00e9 from 27 to 31\nJuly 1998 within the framework of the Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa are\nparticularly illustrative in that regard. I would like to thank\nthe Secretary-General and donor countries for their support\nof the activities of that Committee. We know that we can\ncontinue to count on their support in implementing the\nrecommendations of that seminar, especially in continuing\nthe Committee\u2019s activities. That institution is called on to\nplay a crucial role in mobilizing the countries of central\nAfrica to take responsibility for the security of their\nsubregion under the aegis of the United Nations.\nAlso with regard to prevention, the recent creation in\nRome of the International Criminal Court is a timely\naddition to the mechanisms that protect human rights and\nmaintain peace. The International Criminal Court will in\neffect be responsible for prosecuting and punishing persons\nguilty of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity\nand the crime of aggression. Cameroon is pleased to have\nbeen one of the first signatories to its Statute and hopes that\nall States will become parties to it. To this end, it is urgent\nthat the crime of aggression be rapidly and clearly defined.\nThis would abolish the impunity of aggressors and prove to\nthe peoples of the world our real determination to put an\nend to war once and for all.\nIn the context of this general debate, I have\ndeliberately chosen, as the Assembly has seen, not to touch\non most current problems, particularly ongoing crises. I\nwanted to concentrate on certain permanent essential values\nthat lie at the basis of the two observances I mentioned,\nwhose violation causes most of the misfortune in our world\ntoday. I refer to the human persons\u2019s right to dignity and\nfulfilment, the right to development and the right to\npeace \u2014 in short, the right to life. The United Nations is\nthe guarantor of their observance and promotion.\nFor Africa, the recent report of the Secretary-General,\nwhich should act as a kind of compass for all of us, lays\ndown the foundations for all those committed to working\nfor the prosperity of our peoples. In reality, all regions of\nthe world need this kind of wake-up call and this kind of\nreport. We are accountable to future generations for making\nthese values a reality.\nLet us not disappoint. Let us not allow people to be\nleft along the side of the road. It is up to us to do\neverything possible so that these humane values remain a\nconstant concern of the United Nations and of its\nspecialized agencies.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to recall the late B.P.\nKoirala, the legendary leader who became the symbol of\ndemocracy in Nepal because of his long years of\nimprisonment, self-sacrifice and struggle. As the first\nelected Prime Minister of Nepal, he stood at this podium\n38 years ago to this very day and declared that the\nforeign policy of Nepal would be inspired by the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations. He said that Nepal\nlooked upon the United Nations as an instrument for\npromoting peace and justice among nations. Those\nsentiments have always guided Nepal?s international\nrelations.\nIt is my pleasure to extend to you, Sir, the warm\ncongratulations of my delegation on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to your\ngreat country?s contribution to the work of the United\nNations and a recognition of your own personal\nqualifications. Please be assured of the cooperation of my\ndelegation in your work. I would also like to place on\nrecord our appreciation to your predecessor,\nMr. Udovenko, for the wisdom and deftness of touch with\nwhich he guided the previous session.\nI would also like to express, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Nepal, our deep sympathy\nand condolences to the Governments and the peoples of\nBangladesh and China on the massive loss of life and\nproperty due to the recent devastating floods in those two\nfriendly neighbouring countries. We also sympathize with\nthe victims of hurricane Georges.\nIt is heartening to note that this year we are\ncelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. While we are guided by\nlofty human rights goals in the international field, we are\nno less committed to attaining them at the national level.\nOur commitment to democracy, human rights and\nuplifting the quality of life of the people is unflinching,\ndespite a low level of economic development and the\ninnumerable constraints, including the problem of\nrefugees. It is our firm belief that democracy and\n4\n\n\ndevelopment should reinforce each other. Society can enjoy\nuninterrupted peace and progress only when the rule of law\nand the participation of an entire people in governance and\ndevelopment are ensured.\nWe are a small nation with a great heritage. Our\ntradition has been one of peace, compassion and\nbrotherhood. We have always striven to promote\nunderstanding and goodwill among different nations,\nespecially with our neighbours. While retaining our age-old\ncultural values, our people have struggled for years and\nhave made great sacrifices to establish democratic\ninstitutions and to uphold the principles of human rights\nand dignity. In this endeavour we are conscious of the\nchallenges that we have to face. But we are determined to\nmake all possible efforts to fulfil the aspirations of our\npeople and, in our limited way, to contribute to the\nachievement of the noble ideals of this great Organization,\nwhich provides us with a forum to express our views on the\nconcerns of mankind.\nI consider it a privilege and an opportunity to make an\nappeal to the developed nations to extend support and\ncooperation in our endeavour to preserve the dignity and\nhonour of our people and the sovereignty of our nation. We\nare determined to face every eventuality to defend those\nideals.\nCentralized planning has failed to produce desired\nresults even after many years. We believe that unless\npeople are mobilized, from the grass roots to the policy\nlevel, the reality on the ground is unlikely to change. To\nrealize this, institutional and legal changes are necessary.\nAdministrative, financial and political systems have all to\nbe decentralized. Real power has to be transferred to the\npeople. We have taken certain steps in that direction.\nHowever, I admit that this is not enough.\nWe are committed to the empowerment of women.\nBut changing gender hierarchies without changing social\nand economic hierarchies is not possible, as gender\nrelations do not operate in a vacuum. It is a fact that gender\nrelations are related to and influenced by social, economic\nand political systems. Nevertheless, as a prelude to the\npolitical empowerment of Nepali women, 20 per cent of the\nseats in local bodies have been reserved. As a result, 36,000\nwomen are now in the political hierarchy at the grass-roots\nlevel. In my opinion, this is a significant breakthrough.\nThe list of problems facing us is endless. We live\ntoday in an unequal world, where global disparities in\nwealth and income are rising rapidly, widening the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, increasingly dividing\nhuman societies into one of plenty, luxury and power, on\nthe one hand, and one of poverty and hardship, on the\nother. The low level of economic development due to the\nlack of capital and technology, among other things, is\nhampering the progress and prosperity of developing\ncountries. Similarly, the falling prices of primary\ncommodities, the lack of access to international markets\nand the low level of resource flows and the unfavourable\ninternational economic environment have compounded the\ndifficulties of the developing countries. The worldwide\nwave of liberalism in trade and services in the aftermath\nof World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements has\nmoved the international economy to greater\ncompetitiveness. However, the capacity of the developing\ncountries to trade needs to be sufficiently enhanced to\nensure a level playing field.\nThe current financial and economic crisis facing\nmany countries is affecting even the advanced economies\nof the world, not to mention the vulnerable and weaker\nones. This calls for much-needed reforms in the global\nfinancial system.\nThe developing world consists of 85 per cent of\nhumanity, more than one third of them in the least\ndeveloped countries. One third of the countries in this\nmost vulnerable category are landlocked, and this\nstructural deficiency is the greatest handicap to fair\ncompetition and development. All these countries have a\nvital stake in peace and development. In the shaping of a\nnew global dispensation, each category of nations should\nhave a voice and should receive fair and equal treatment.\nSustainable development is not only an economic or\necological phenomenon; it also involves participatory\ngovernance, empowerment of women and promotion of\nequity and justice. In a developing country such as Nepal,\nthe role and participation of women in the development\nprocess are of great significance because of the multiple\nresponsibilities of women. In this context, the role of the\nUnited Nations system in enhancing the participation of\nwomen in national development and in creating awareness\nof the issues relating to women is laudable.\nOn our march towards a democratic and just society,\nwe face many challenges, such as pervasive poverty, mass\nilliteracy, environmental degradation, population explosion\nand, above all, gender inequality. We believe that many\nproblems related to economic development can be more\neffectively tackled through regional and subregional\ncooperation among nations. Tremendous opportunities are\n5\n\n\navailable for subregional cooperation in our part of the\nworld among the countries in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-\nMeghna basin. These opportunities include water resources\ndevelopment, flood control, energy supply, forestry\nmanagement and environmental protection, among other\nthings. Development efforts in water resources, for\nexample, would help irrigate the fertile fields in the plains\nof India, improve the waterways so vital for the\ntransportation sector of Bangladesh and generate\nhydropower in Nepal to meet the energy needs of the\nregion as a whole. Such a development strategy may be the\nkey to the future prosperity of the region.\nNearly a quarter of the world?s population continues\nto live in extreme poverty. This is largely because our\napproach to development, in which the State plays an\noverwhelming role, has given rise to inefficiency and\ncorruption, and our reliance on unregulated market forces\nhas led to an increase in inequality across the world. We\nbelieve there is a need for a third alternative in which the\nhuman being is at the centre, not the State or market forces;\nthe human being with faith, values, emotions; the human\nbeing with dreams and aspirations as a citizen, as a member\nof family and as an economic being. This approach takes\ninto account all the dimensions of the human being and\nsociety. Changing economic relationships and structure\nalone is not enough. The individual also has to change. We\nbelieve that this is what we should be pursuing in the\ntwenty-first century.\nI bring the greetings and good wishes of the\nGovernment and the people of Nepal to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan. In a comparatively short period\nof time, he has proved his dedication to the task of\nmodernizing our Organization and his great diplomatic\ntalent and statesmanship in defusing situations posing a real\nthreat to international peace and security. In the process of\nreform which he has started with his far-reaching package\nof proposals, he can count on Nepal?s support.\nReform by its very nature is a continuing process. The\nUnited Nations and its principal organs, such as the\nSecurity Council, must adapt to the dynamics of change.\nHowever, we, the Member States, have so far failed to\narrive at a general agreement to improve the composition\nand functioning of the Security Council to better reflect the\nreality of a vastly expanded membership of the\nOrganization. The recently concluded summit of the Non-\nAligned Movement in South Africa reaffirmed the\ncollective position of non-aligned countries in this regard.\nNo scheme of reform, however, should undermine\nthe power and authority of the General Assembly, which\nis the nearest thing to a world parliament. All the leaders\nof Nepal who have addressed the Assembly have\nunderscored the role and authority of this most democratic\nand representative organ where each of us has a voice and\nvote equal to that of a great Power, on any questions or\nany matters within the scope of the Charter of the\nOrganization.\nSound and secure financing is the basis for good\nmanagement of the Organization. We believe that all\nMember States must fulfil their obligations to make full\nand timely payment of their dues.\nIn its primary role in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, peacekeeping has been\nand will remain one of the indispensable tools of the\nUnited Nations. As a troop-contributing country, we are\nhappy to commemorate 50 years of United Nations\npeacekeeping. Over these years, Nepal has contributed\nmore than 32,000 troops and military and civilian police\nmonitors to various peacekeeping missions of the United\nNations around the globe. Many of them have lost lives\nor limbs in the cause of peace. Nepal has signed a stand-\nby system agreement with the United Nations. We are\ncommitted to deploying up to 2,000 troops, including\nmedical and engineering units, military observers and\nheadquarters staff, and 200 police monitors available to\nbe called at any time by the United Nations, even on\nshort notice.\nThe recent nuclear tests in South Asia, which came\nas a disturbing development, have nevertheless reinforced\nour commitment to speeding up the time-bound nuclear\ndisarmament process. We welcome the declarations made\nby the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Hall\nlast week to facilitate the entry into force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nMy delegation is happy to note that the Secretary-\nGeneral has recognized that the United Nations Regional\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the\nPacific, known as the Kathmandu Centre, has provided a\nvaluable forum for meetings on regional confidence and\nsecurity-building measures. As host to the Centre, Nepal\nwould urge Member States of the Asia-Pacific region to\nincreasingly avail themselves of the services of the\nCentre.\nProblems related to drug abuse and terrorism defy\nterritorial barriers. As the Prime Minister of Nepal,\n6\n\n\nMr. Girija Prasad Koirala, stated at the Durban summit at\nthe beginning of this month, they add to the intricacies of\ncomplex regional and global relations. The terrorist\nbombings in Kenya and Tanzania deserve universal\ncondemnation. These bombings and the subsequent missile\nstrikes came as a shock, reinforcing our belief that\nconcerted international efforts are essential in this regard.\nLet me conclude by briefly mentioning the South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),\nconsisting of seven countries of the region representing one\nfifth of humanity. We are united in a common effort to\nimprove the quality of life of all our peoples. The recent\nColombo summit agreed to draw up a SAARC social\ncharter to give further dimension to regional cooperation.\nThe seven SAARC countries also finalized a text of a\nregional convention on combatting the crime of trafficking\nin women and children for prostitution. The convention will\nbe signed in Kathmandu at the next SAARC summit. This\nwill be another landmark in regional cooperation in South\nAsia.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It was the wish of His\nExcellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic of\nMalawi, to come and address the General Assembly in\nperson, but owing to pressing commitments at home he has\nbeen unable to do so. I therefore deliver this statement on\nhis behalf.\nLet me join preceding speakers in conveying deep\nsympathy to the peoples of the Caribbean region and of the\nsouthern United States with regard to the natural disaster,\nin the form of a hurricane, which has struck them over the\npast few days.\nLet me congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election\nto the presidency of the current session of the General\nAssembly and to affirm our confidence in his ability to\nconduct the work of this session successfully. I would like\nalso to pay a special tribute to his predecessor, Mr.\nHennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the innovative and\nconstructive manner in which he carried out his task\nduring the fifty-second session. His wit and sense of\nhumour helped the Assembly accomplish so much during\na very difficult session, which was probably a turning-\npoint in the work of the United Nations. The reforms that\nwe agreed upon during the reform Assembly should\nsurely provide the necessary momentum for a more\nefficient and effective United Nations.\nLet me also express my sincere appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, especially for the\nmanner in which he has shouldered his important\nresponsibilities. His outstanding leadership role,\nparticularly with regard to United Nations reform, the\nproblems of my own continent, Africa, and during the\nrecent Iraq crisis has put the United Nations back at\ncentre stage in its meaningful engagement in international\naffairs. We encourage the Secretary-General to continue\nhis good work with the same dynamic spirit so as to\nbetter adapt the Organization to the current and future\nneeds of mankind.\nMalawi fully supports the reforms that are being\nundertaken by the United Nations. We have no doubt that\nthey will not only increase the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our Organization, but also enable it to\nrespond effectively and in a timely manner to new\nchallenges. I particularly welcome the creation of the post\nof Deputy Secretary-General. I believe that with this new\noffice the United Nations will continue to play a central\nrole in promoting economic and social development and\nenhancing assistance for development, particularly to\ndeveloping countries.\nThe development agenda, focusing on the eradication\nof poverty and the provision of basic amenities to\nhumankind, corresponds to the efforts of the Organization\nin the area of peace and security. They indeed\ncomplement each other.\nMalawi looks forward to the finalization of the\nremaining issues on the reform package, including\nproposals on the Millennium Assembly, which we fully\nsupport.\nThis year\u2019s session of the General Assembly comes\nat a time when we are commemorating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. We believe it is now time to take stock of the\nprogress that has been made in the promotion and\nprotection of human rights since the Universal Declaration\n21\n\n\nwas adopted in 1948 and identify additional ways and\nmeans to help enhance the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights universally.\nThe United Nations machinery for the promotion and\nprotection of human rights has done an impeccable job in\nthe past, and Malawi places a lot of trust in it to do even\nbetter in the near future, particularly in a reformed United\nNations where a human rights culture will permeate the\nsystem as a whole. While recognizing the critical role\nplayed by the United Nations in this field, we also believe\nthat Member States hold the key to a world free of\nimpunity, a global society where human rights transcend all\nour apparent divisions.\nWe should therefore not only preach the promotion\nand protection of human rights but also put into practice\nwhat we preach and deepen our understanding of the\nsubject. Since the concept of human rights may not be\nclearly understood by many sectors of our societies, the\nsuccess of building a human rights culture across our\nsocieties will depend on the ability of our Governments and\ncivil society to provide civic education to the people.\nIn Malawi we have created necessary institutions, such\nas the Human Rights Commission, the Law Reform\nCommission, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Anti-\ncorruption Bureau which, together with various non-\ngovernmental organizations, are playing a critical role in\nenhancing a deeper understanding of human rights as well\nas related issues of governance.\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, our\noptimism about a better future based on the rule of law and\nrespect for the rights of others has been further fortified by\nthe adoption last July in Rome of the Statute on the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. Malawi\nfully supports this Court and looks forward to the early\nentry into force of the Statute and the finalization of the\noutstanding issues before the Preparatory Commission.\nHowever, we pause in our optimism about a better\nworld because of certain trends and developments. Malawi\nis particularly disturbed by the recent wave of terrorist acts.\nTerrorism is a threat to peace, security and stability, and\ntherefore cannot be condoned in whatever form or\nmanifestation. We condemn terrorism and reject this\ncowardly phenomenon as a means of resolving disputes,\nmisunderstandings or political differences. We believe that\ncollectively we should redouble our efforts to deal with\nterrorism by establishing more measures aimed at its total\nelimination. Malawi also strongly condemns the barbaric\nacts of terrorism that took place during August in Nairobi,\nKenya; Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania; Omagh, Northern\nIreland; and Cape Town, South Africa.\nSimilarly, we are gravely concerned about the\namassing of weapons of mass destruction, including\nnuclear weapons, which threaten the future of mankind.\nRecent tests by some countries confirm our fears. We\ncannot place blame on these countries alone, so long as\nothers possess these weapons. The Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) regimes\nare not an end in themselves. We believe that our\nultimate goal should be the complete elimination of all\nthese dangerous weapons within a specific time frame, so\nas to guarantee the safety of the world.\nAs we approach the new millennium, it is important\nthat all the existing contradictions which hinder the\nachievement of global peace and security be removed.\nOne way of doing this is to abide by relevant\ninternational instruments. In this regard, I wish to inform\nthe Assembly that Malawi has recently ratified the\nChemical Weapons Convention and the Convention on\nanti-personnel mines. Malawi welcomes the coming into\nforce of the Convention on anti-personnel mines. We\nappeal to all States which have not yet done so to become\nparties to these instruments without further delay.\nMalawi has a long-standing history of peace, as well\nas social and political stability. In 1994 Malawians opted\nfor a democratic multi-party system of government which\nguarantees fundamental freedoms to every citizen. In the\nlast four years we have established democratic institutions\nthat stand for the rule of law and good governance, as\nwell as respect for fundamental freedoms such as\ntransparency and accountability. We have managed to\nachieve these because of the peace and stability that now\nprevail in our country. The right to peace is a right that\nwe cherish for all. The development that we seek for the\nworld cannot be realized without security and peace.\nWithin our region Malawi attaches considerable\nimportance to cooperation with respect to conflict\nprevention and resolution. The commendable work\nundertaken through the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\nand Resolution deserves special mention. Given the\nmagnitude and complexity of the problems to be resolved,\nthat body needs increased support from the international\ncommunity to accomplish its laudable goals.\n22\n\n\nWe believe that the best way to resolve disputes or\nconflicts in order to guarantee durable peace, security and\nstability is through amicable negotiation and not force.\nMalawi therefore welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s report\non Africa and the interest it has generated. We are\nencouraged by the positive interventions that the United\nNations has made to date. The debate of the Security\nCouncil last week at Foreign Minister level will only fortify\nAfrica\u2019s resolve to galvanize its collective political will.\nIndeed, Malawi applauds the commitment of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Despite all the efforts of the United\nNations \u2014 during which many have lost their lives in the\nservice of peace \u2014 conflicts and factional wars continue in\nvarious parts of the world, causing death, massive\ndisplacements of populations and floods of refugees and\nloss of property. Angola, Kosovo, Afghanistan and other\nparts of the globe continue to furnish tragic examples of the\nproblems that beset us.\nWe are disturbed by developments in Angola. The\ndelay in the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord and\nthe non-compliance with various Security Council\nresolutions are of grave concern to us. The people of\nAngola deserve much better. The ultimate tribute to the late\nMr. Alioune Blondin Beye and all the many others that\nhave died in the quest for peace would be the restoration of\npeace and reconciliation in Angola. We therefore call on\nUNITA in particular to take all necessary steps to facilitate\nthe implementation of the remaining issues under the\nLusaka peace accord in order to give the people of Angola\na chance for peace and security.\nWe are equally concerned with the developments in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Malawi supports the\ndecisions taken by the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) at its recent summit meeting in\nMauritius. Peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand the whole Great Lakes region will only make Africa\nrealize its vast potential.\nIn Burundi, the Republic of the Congo, the Central\nAfrican Republic, the Comoros and Guinea-Bissau, and\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, dialogue must prevail in the\nsearch for solutions to the problems that affect them. We\ncall on all parties to give a peaceful resolution of their\nproblems a chance in order for them to achieve a lasting\nsolution. Kosovo and Afghanistan continue to bleed, while\nhunger and despair ravage the southern belly of the Sudan,\nand the humanitarian crisis in Somalia continues. The\ninternational community can indeed make a difference.\nIn Sierra Leone, we express our relief that the\ndemocratically elected Government of President Ahmad\nTejan Kabbah has resumed its rightful place. We applaud\nthe efforts of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) and the OAU in this regard. We\nsupport the initiatives that President Kabbah is pursuing\nas the country starts the long, slow process of\nreconstruction and rehabilitation. Malawi welcomes the\ndevelopments in Nigeria, and we encourage President\nAbubakar to forge ahead with all the necessary reforms\ntowards the restoration of democratic rule in Nigeria. In\nWestern Sahara, Malawi is following the developments\nwith keen interest. We welcome the Houston accords and\nlook forward to the referendum later in the year.\nThe overwhelming adoption on 7 July last of\nresolution 52/250 on Palestine was a clear manifestation\nof the international community\u2019s desire to begin a new\nchapter in the Middle East. As with civilization, peace\nand security in the Middle East would no doubt have a\nreverberating effect on developments in world affairs as\nwe enter into the next century. We call upon Israel and\nthe Palestinian Authority to bring fresh impetus to their\nnegotiations. Malawi welcomes the current initiatives\naimed at giving new momentum to the negotiations.\nMalawi also welcomes the recent developments on the\nquestion relating to the Lockerbie disaster. We trust these\ndevelopments will lead to an early resolution of the\nmatter and therefore an urgent lifting of sanctions against\nLibya.\nOne of the major issues for the United Nations is the\nconcern for national identity. In this century nations have\nbeen born. Great nations have disintegrated, while others\nhave found new solutions and come back together. It is in\nthis spirit of helping the powers of healing that Malawi\nstands to reiterate its conviction that the question of the\nparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\nactivities of the United Nations on the basis of respect for\nthe principle of universality and the sovereign equality of\nStates deserves consideration. Malawi believes that\nappropriate participation by the Republic of China on\nTaiwan in the international community would be an\nimportant factor for peace, stability and international\ncooperation in that part of the world.\nMalawi will hold general elections next year. This\nfollows the multiparty elections held in 1994, the first in\n30 years. During that election, the United Democratic\nFront took the reins of power following a free, fair and\ncredible electoral process. The change that we decided\nupon is irreversible, and all necessary measures are being\n23\n\n\ntaken to consolidate the new dispensation. We are\ncommitted to facilitating the exercise by all of our people\nof their civil and political rights. The Government of\nMalawi is committed to holding free and fair presidential\nand parliamentary elections.\nWe therefore invite the international community to\ncome to Malawi and witness the electoral process. At the\nsame time, we appeal to it, particularly development\npartners, to help us with logistical, financial and human\nresource support. Free and fair elections can be realized\nonly through the provision of adequate resources. We\nexpect the United Nations to play a critical role in this\noverall effort, which the people of Malawi so desire.\nSince the multiparty Government was ushered in, it\nhas striven to increase the pace of economic reform in\nMalawi. We value economic, social and cultural rights,\nincluding the right to development, in the same way as we\ndo civil and political rights. We believe that the private\nsector should be the engine of economic growth and that\nthe duty of the Government is to create a conducive\nenvironment. In this respect, the Government of Malawi has\nembarked on a privatization process, disengaging itself from\nthe commercially oriented parastatals.\nApart from the conducive investment climate obtaining\nin Malawi, banking and financial services have also been\nliberalized. The economic and financial reforms that we\nhave embarked on can be successfully sustained only if\nthey are backed by adequate support from the international\ncommunity, including a favourable international economic\nclimate.\nThe world trade and financial outlook, however,\nappears hostile for commodity-dependent countries like\nMalawi. As we approach the next millennium, the negative\neffects of globalization and liberalization, particularly on\nweak economies, should be addressed with the necessary\nresolve and in a holistic fashion. The persistence of poverty\nin the world, particularly in Africa, requires the elaboration\nwithin the various bodies of coherent policies to confront\nthe major problems that impede development. External\ndebt, deteriorating terms of trade, difficulties in or lack of\naccess to international markets, declining official\ndevelopment assistance and the negative effect of structural\nadjustment programmes all form a myriad of issues that\nrequire urgent attention.\nAll these issues have to be addressed within the\ncontext of the need for the rational utilization of the world\u2019s\nnatural resources and the need to protect the environment.\nThe world cannot remain aloof as poverty and despair\nwreak havoc on many of our people. The many gains that\nwe will have made in civil and political rights will have\nno meaning at all if the socioeconomic ills that the people\nconfront are not addressed. We are encouraged by the\nhigh-level dialogue held here recently. What is needed is\naction to realize fully the economic, social and cultural\nrights that we also seek.\nThe founding fathers of this Organization gave us an\ninstrument which has withstood the test of time. It\nremains a relevant instrument. As we prepare for the third\nmillennium, let us operationalize it in partnership for the\nglobal community, so that we may together triumph over\nsuffering and despair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is such\na pleasure that a distinguished son of our region should\npreside over these proceedings. We wish you well and\npledge our full support.\nThis year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nbirth of a Declaration which was predicated on the\nassumption that the right to development is a human right.\nThe golden jubilee of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights could not have occurred at a more timely juncture\nin the history of international affairs. Article 23 of the\nDeclaration insists that everyone has the right to work, the\nfree choice of employment and protection against\nunemployment. Article 28 boasts that everyone is entitled\nto a social and international order in which the rights and\nfreedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully\nrealized.\nHowever, the trends that shape the international\norder today, the issues that are affecting the destiny of\nStates, are running counter to the spirit of that\nDeclaration, and are, in fact, threatening and hindering\nthat right to development so nobly expressed 50 years\nago.\nAs the world enters the dawn of a new millennium,\nthe phenomenon of globalization characterizes the new\ninternational order. There is no escaping the reality that\nglobalization is today a fact of life: the integration and\ninterlocking of systems of production, finance and capital\nand trade, and liberalized markets that have shunned\nnational boundaries and have produced remarkable wealth\nand economic growth.\n22\n\n\nBut there is an almost ominous ring about the word\n\u201cglobalization\u201d. It gobbles up the small plankton of\ncountries which cannot adjust to the frenzy of the market.\nGlobalization has not been all about wealth and prosperity\nfor all the nations of the world. For billions of people in the\ndeveloping world, it has used them and bypassed them,\nwhen in reality, globalization should be about development\nfor all.\nThe 1997 United Nations Development Programme\nreport confirms that only a few fortunate countries had\nbenefited from globalization. Those countries which have\nshared in the rapidly expanded world trade have seen their\nown trade become a larger proportion of their gross\ndomestic product. But for 44 developing countries, with\nmore than a billion people, this key ratio had been falling\nover the previous decade. Yes, the growth in financial\nflows has been rapid, but its circulation has been\npredominantly in the capital markets of the developed\nworld, while investment flows have coursed through only\na few developing countries.\nThe Asian Tiger economies, which had achieved\namazing levels of development and growth in a short space\nof time, had been held up as models for the new age of\nglobal free markets. However, the collapse of these\neconomies in 1997, coming three years after the Mexican\ncase, has reinforced fears that globalization has made the\nworld economy more volatile and more unstable. That even\nsuch star performers would be battered so severely suggests\nthat vulnerability has increased significantly with\nglobalization. Foreign money can flee as quickly as it\ncomes in and leave countries in deep trouble.\nSaint Lucia is one of those countries caught up on the\ndizzy Ferris wheel of globalization, without the luxury of\nthe choice of being able to jump off or determine how the\nwheel spins. Trade liberalization, the twin of globalization,\nhas not been kind to us, and the midwife of trade\nliberalization \u2014 the World Trade Organization (WTO) \u2014\nhas dealt us an even more unkind cut.\nLast year, the head of our Government, Prime Minister\nDr. Kenny Anthony, in his address to the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, complained of the\nimpact on Saint Lucia and the Caribbean of a ruling by the\nWTO with respect to the European banana marketing\nregime. That ruling, which was instigated by a few\ncomplainant countries from the Americas, has the capacity\nto lead to the social and economic destruction of a number\nof small States in the Caribbean, like Saint Lucia, for which\nbananas are a major vital export commodity. That ruling\ntears at the heart of our development process, as it can\ntake away from us a system which allows us a\npreferential market for a crop which is the backbone of\nour economy.\nDeveloping countries and many renowned jurists\nhave criticized the process pursued by the WTO in this\ncase, but what was equally worrying is that the panel did\nnot take into account the developmental, social and\nenvironmental impact of the implementation of this ruling.\nThe WTO is not only to be a trade policeman, but is\nsupposed to contribute to improving standards of living.\nFollowing the ruling by the WTO last year, that the\nbanana marketing regime was incompatible with its\nregulations, the European Union had been trying to amend\nthe regime. The objective was not only to make it WTO-\ncompatible, but at the same time, to preserve the kind of\naccess it gave us to the European market \u2014 an access\nessential for our economic development. Earlier this year\nthe European Union accepted amendments to the banana\nregime which we are all convinced make it WTO-\ncompatible. We, the banana-producing countries of the\nCaribbean, may have wished that some of the provisions\nnow adopted were different, but we are satisfied that the\nnew regime allows us the opportunity to continue to\nsurvive in the market place and sustain our development\nlargely through our own efforts.\nThe European Union retained the special safeguards\nof Lom\u00e9 to enable us to market our bananas; and with the\nLom\u00e9 Convention now in receipt of a WTO waiver, we\nthought that we had been given the breathing space we\nneeded for orderly reform and diversification and for\nadjustment to the new realities of globalization. But,\ndespite this, the United States and a group of Central\nAmerican countries are continuing an onslaught against\nour banana industry.\nOne year after our Prime Minister appealed to this\nbody for good sense and sensitivity to prevail in the\nsettling of world trade disputes, in the consideration by\ninternational institutions of the plight of the\ndisadvantaged, and in the conduct of strong and powerful\ncountries towards smaller and poorer ones, we return to\ntell the Assembly that those who should have heeded this\nappeal seem to have chosen not to hear it.\nThe pursuit of this banana policy by the United\nStates and the Central American countries will expose the\neconomies of the Caribbean to severe and possibly\nirreparable damage. This is a violation of our right to\n23\n\n\ndevelopment \u2014 a right that the United Nations recognized\nas an inalienable human right when it adopted the\nDeclaration on the Right to Development at the 97th\nplenary meeting of the forty-first session of the General\nAssembly on 4 December 1986. One year ago, our Prime\nMinister, before this Assembly, called upon the United\nStates of America to re-examine its policies towards the\nCaribbean, particularly its lead role in the challenge to the\nbanana marketing regime. We are now engaged in a\ndialogue with the United States hoping to avert a\nreconvening of the World Trade Organization dispute panel.\nOnce again we urge the United States and the other\ncomplainant countries to apply the spirit of cooperation and\nconsultation to this situation so that we can find a mutually\nacceptable solution to what they perceive to be the\nproblems.\nGlobalization must not be used by powerful States as\nan excuse to condemn us to a permanent state of\nunderdevelopment and poverty. Already the rich nations of\nthe world appear to be using globalization as an excuse for\ntheir withdrawal from active engagement in the battle\nagainst poverty.\nThe scourge of poverty is not new, neither has it ever\nbeen acceptable. What is unacceptable is that given all the\nstrides we have made this century in science and\ntechnology, in the creation of vast oceans of wealth, we at\nthe same time have failed to reduce the levels of poverty\naround the world.\nMany people have enjoyed the benefits of supersonic\naircraft, 200-mile-per-hour trains, satellite telephones, global\ntelevision, the Internet and 24-hour markets. Yet, in the\nsame world and at the same time, there are millions who\nhave never ridden in a motor vehicle, used a telephone,\nswitched on an electric light or had pipe-borne water;\nmillions wholly unfamiliar with such everyday amenities as\nrefrigerators and television sets; millions who cannot read\nor write; millions of children who do not go to school;\nmillions of infants who do not get enough food to survive.\nA more vigorous effort to eliminate extreme\ndeprivation should surely be a high priority for the new\nmillennium. Saint Lucia believes this should be achieved by\nthe end of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\nPoverty \u2014 by the year 2006.\nEconomic progress in recent decades has lifted large\nnumbers out of acute poverty, and success on this front has\nbeen particularly notable in the populous country of China.\nBut there is no evidence yet that globally there has been a\ndecline in the number of those classified as \u201cabsolute\npoor\u201d: people whose incomes never rise above the dollar-\na-day threshold. These are reckoned to amount to 1.3\nbillion people, or one in every three persons in the\ndeveloping world. Nearly three fourths of these people\nlive in Asia, but the highest proportion of very poor\npeople is in Africa. The 1997 report of the United\nNations Development Programme states that the total\nfigure appears to be rising with population growth, except\nin South-East Asia and the Pacific. But this was written\nbefore the economic typhoon that battered such South-\nEast Asian countries as Indonesia in 1998, impoverishing\nmany millions of people in that region, and before the\nserious floods in China had dispossessed so many people.\nYet most countries have failed to lift their aid\ntowards the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national\nproduct \u2014 the internationally agreed target set several\ndecades ago. In fact, aid from the G-7 countries fell in\n1997 to just 0.19 per cent of their collective gross\nnational product.\nThe necessity for the rich countries to understand\nthat the new international order of globalization does not\nconsider the special circumstances of small States is\nemphasized by the vulnerability of these small States to\nother elements, such as natural disasters. The extreme\nvulnerability of small island States, like Saint Lucia, was\ngraphically illustrated only last week in the Caribbean. In\njust a few hours Hurricane Georges created havoc and\ndestruction in the northern islands of the Caribbean \u2014\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, the Virgin\nIslands, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and\nothers. In any one island, at least two decades of\neconomic development were blown away by two hours of\nstorm. That is the extent of the economic vulnerability of\nthese islands. As they struggle to rebuild their economies,\nas their people try to reorganize their lives again, we\nappeal to the Member States of the United Nations to be\ngenerous in coming forward with assistance for their\nredevelopment efforts.\nIn a world of an international order that is\nuncompromising for small States, of inadequate attention\nto the plight of the poor and to the harsh destructive\nforces of Mother Nature, it is the United Nations that\nmust become a beacon and a haven for the small and the\npowerless, for the hungry and the disadvantaged. It is in\nthe United Nations that they must find hope and comfort,\nanswers and solutions to their problems. For this,\nhowever, there must be a United Nations that is as\nsensitive to the danger inherent in small-State\n24\n\n\nvulnerability as it is to the horrors of nuclear warfare,\nbiological and chemical weapons and international\nterrorism. International terrorism can take many forms. To\ndestroy a country\u2019s economic base and thrust its people into\nthe slow death of unemployment, poverty and despair is as\nhorrendous as the instant killing of its citizens by a bomb\nblast.\nWhile we support the call for a strong abhorrence of\ninternational terrorism, we must deplore equally abhorrent\nacts of unilateral counter-terrorism. Such actions violate the\nculture of peace and consensus which the United Nations\nstrives to inculcate.\nThere must be a United Nations with a greater\ncommitment to upholding and fulfilling the tenets of article\n28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Right to Development.\nThere must therefore be further reform of the United\nNations to make it more democratic and more appreciative\nof the voices of the majority, rather than the power of the\nminority. Saint Lucia therefore supports the call by the\nSecretary-General for continued urgent reform of the United\nNations, provided that it leads to a fairer, more caring and\nmore equitable institution.\nSaint Lucia also strongly supports the statement\ndelivered by Indonesia on behalf of the G-77 at the high-\nlevel dialogue on globalization held here recently and the\ngrowing consensus that there is urgent need for global\ngovernance of financial and trade matters. Indeed, because\nof its universal membership and success in promoting\ninternational cooperation for development, the United\nNations is the best vehicle to foster agreement on standards,\nnorms and regulations for the new financial order of the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe building of a new international financial\narchitecture for the twenty-first century cannot be done\npiecemeal or by a few exclusive States. It requires global\nparticipation, coordinated by the United Nations. Saint\nLucia therefore calls for a global conference to address this\nissue similar to that held on matters pertaining to the\nenvironment, population and housing.\nBut reform must not be confined only to the United\nNations. In a world of trade liberalization which is not\nfriendly to small States, the guardian of the free market\nprocess must itself be reformed. Saint Lucia therefore\nreiterates its call, first made to the fifty-second session of\nthe General Assembly last year, for reform of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) and in particular its dispute-\nsettlement procedures. A revisiting of the WTO began in\nSingapore, where developing countries had to assert the\nlimits of WTO interventionism.\nWhat is additionally required of the WTO now was\noutlined by Prime Minister Mr. Kenny Anthony when, in\nhis capacity as Chairman of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM), he addressed the recent meeting of heads of\nState of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban, South\nAfrica. He said:\n\u201cMore generally, the WTO must now take urgent\nsteps to implement the agreement at Singapore, for\na special regime for the least developed countries\nand those who share the characteristics of fragility.\nIt is time that values like fairness and equity asserted\ntheir legitimacy in the ethically neutral world of\nglobalization and liberalization.\u201d\nSaint Lucia firmly believes that despite the actions\nof developed countries, we in the developing world can\nourselves assert and protect our right to development if\nwe engage in greater cooperation among ourselves. We in\nthe Caribbean have for years been engaged in an\nintegration movement which has strengthened our\ncapacity to deal with the challenges of international\nrelations. Indeed, this year Saint Lucia was proud to be\nthe host nation for the celebration of the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which created\nthe Caribbean Community.\nAs we embark on the next quarter of a century,\nSaint Lucia pledges to work for even greater union in the\nCaribbean Community and closer association between all\nthe countries of the Caribbean Sea. It is for this reason\nthat Saint Lucia welcomes the recent initiatives that have\nbrought Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti into a\ncloser relationship with CARICOM as we seek to forge\na new partnership with the European Union. In this\nconnection, Saint Lucia calls for the understanding that\nCuba is a Caribbean country and that closer relations with\nother Caribbean countries is a natural evolution which\nmust not be perceived as being hostile to the interests of\nextraregional Powers. We call too for the lifting of the\neconomic embargo against Cuba and for its reintegration\ninto the inter-American system. It is only through\ndialogue and consultation, not through conflict and\nhostility, that problems are permanently solved.\nSaint Lucia also welcomes the recent meeting in\nDurban between the Caribbean Community and the\nSouthern African Development Community, which laid\nthe basis for the future strengthening of relations between\n25\n\n\nthe two regions. We applaud also the decision by the heads\nof State of the Non-Aligned Movement to hold a South-\nSouth summit and their decision to convene a standing\nministerial committee for economic cooperation in 1999, to\naddress the challenges and opportunities of globalization.\nOur efforts to realize our right to development can\nenjoy fulfilment only if they take place in an atmosphere of\nworld peace and harmony. We cannot prevent nuclear\ngenies from popping out of bottles unless we destroy all the\nbottles with a treaty designed to eliminate all nuclear\narmaments. The existence of exclusive nuclear clubs is an\nopen invitation to nations which are excluded.\nWe in the Caribbean continue to call for the Caribbean\nto be recognized as a zone of peace. We also call for\nrespect and support of the initiative of CARICOM for the\nCaribbean Sea to be declared a special area in the context\nof sustainable development. Saint Lucia, therefore, like\nother Caribbean States, continues to register its opposition\nto the use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of\nnuclear waste by some great Powers. While\nsome of those Powers can sustain a nuclear accident,\ngiven their size and population, a small island of a few\nhundred thousand people certainly cannot. The best\nguarantee we can obtain against a nuclear accident in the\nCaribbean Sea as a result of the trans-shipment of nuclear\nwaste is not the assurances of the countries engaged in\nthe practice, but a halt to the practice itself.\nAs we call for international recognition of our right\nto determine what kind of place we wish our region to be,\nand as we assert our inalienable human right to\ndevelopment and call upon others to respect that right by\nwithdrawing their challenge to the lifeblood of our\neconomy, we urge the rich nations to recognize the\ninsensitivity of globalization, and we ask the international\ncommunity to take as an example that great international\nleader, President Nelson Mandela. As we seek to establish\na new, more humane international order for the coming\nmillennium, an order that will truly reflect the spirit of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us\nremember the moral leadership that he has given us.\nNelson Mandela taught us that holding steadfast to\nprinciple and insisting on justice can produce change even\nin the most intransigent of systems.\nThe world has become a global neighbourhood, and\nwe must insist on living by brotherly principles and\nvalues. The focus for moral leadership might have shifted\nto the developing world, with Nelson Mandela and Fidel\nCastro as the twin peaks of international inspiration. It is\ntheir lifelong struggle for human rights that must become\nthe touchstone for our developmental goals in this\nanniversary year."

His human skills and vast experience in\ninternational affairs, as well as his dedication to the main\ncauses of our Organization, augur well for the success of\nthe important deliberations of this session. My delegation\nwould like to assure him of its full cooperation.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, who so skilfully and\ndevotedly presided over the last session of the General\nAssembly. Allow me to associate to this tribute Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, our Secretary-General, whose dedication and great\ndiplomatic skills have given greater nobility to our\nOrganization and new reasons for hope to our world. I\nshould like to welcome here the efforts of this great\nAfrican for the international community.\nMy country, the Republic of Benin, could be\nperceived as just a dot on the world map and perhaps just\nas a jot on the map of Africa. In fact, the Republic of\nBenin is not manufacturing any atomic bombs, nor has it\nany intention of building or possessing them. But it is\nwithout any hesitation that I am speaking before the\nrepresentatives of the international community and all the\nmajor Powers gathered here to express the profound\nconcerns we have over the state of the world today, and\nto voice our hopes.\nBenin may be only a small point on the world map,\nbut it wants to be a point of convergence \u2014 not only in\nAfrica, but also for the entire international community.\nWe want to commit ourselves to building peace rather\n17\n\n\nthan bombs, and to promote international cooperation \u2014\nand to promote it first at home.\nThe Government of Benin is committed to building\npeace by consistently cultivating tolerance and a spirit of\nsharing. There is no other explanation for the ever growing\nconsolidation of democracy in Benin. Eschewing the words\nand customs of others, the people of Benin have boldly\nchosen a multi-party system after many years of curtailed\npolitical freedoms. In other words, they have chosen a\npolitics of peace and tolerance. Today more than 100\npolitical parties vie against each other, unite or clash, but\nthey do so in peace and with respect for the Constitution\nand the law.\nMy delegation believes that there is no more urgent\ntask today than replacing the culture of violence and war\nwhich has marked humanity since the dawn of history and\nwhich has so overwhelmed and gravely afflicted Africa and\nother regions of the world. That culture must be replaced\nby the culture of peace. We believe that the foremost duty\nof our Organization continues to be the promotion of peace\nand all its values and the behaviour that underpins and\nstrengthens it.\nWe believe that the first of these values is the spirit of\nsharing. There can be no peace in the world if a small\nportion of humanity can surf the Internet and explore\ninterstellar space while others flounder in quagmire, seeking\na mere pittance or safe shelter in their flight from wars\nwhose root cause is a desire to retain power \u2014 the power\nto control land, gold, oil, diamonds and other natural\nresources solely for the benefit of arms dealers.\nThis apocalyptic picture is unfortunately typical of the\nsad situation in Africa. It is therefore important to unite all\nour efforts to halt all conflicts, not only in Africa, but also\nin Europe, the Balkans \u2014 indeed, wherever they arise.\nThe spirit of tolerance and sharing has prompted my\nGovernment to develop the concept of a common social\nminimum. This means that all citizens of Benin, wherever\nthey reside, must be able to feed, house, clothe, care for\nand educate themselves. It would be desirable for a\ncommon social minimum to be proclaimed as an essential\nobjective on the global scale.\nI should like to pause here to commend the efforts and\ngreat sacrifices made by various Governments and\ninternational organizations \u2014 particularly the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU), the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS), through its Monitoring\nGroup (ECOMOG) and the United Nations itself \u2014 to\nrestore peace to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Ethiopia,\nEritrea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nWhether in Africa or the Balkans, what lasting\nsolution can possibly be imposed by force of arms today?\nWhy do Mr. Savimbi and those who support him, either\ncovertly or overtly, refuse to see that the time for peace\nhas come for the martyred people of Angola?\nWith respect to all those conflicts in Africa, the\nRepublic of Benin welcomes the report (A/52/871)\npresented by the Secretary-General at the request of the\nSecurity Council on the causes of conflict in Africa. The\nSecretary-General?s appeal deserves to be heard and\nsupported, not only by Africans but also by all those\nwhose political, economic or financial decisions will\ninfluence the future of the continent.\nIf the spirit of peace, sharing and tolerance prevailed\nin the Middle East, the long-delayed peace would\nundoubtedly be established there. We have learned in\nrecent days of the efforts which have been resumed so\nmany times by the United States of America to end the\nstagnation of the peace process, for which\nMr. Netanyahu?s Government is principally responsible.\nLet us hope that peace will have a better chance this time.\nOne of the main items on our agenda is the\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime and the\nbanning of nuclear tests. In this connection, the Republic\nof Benin welcomes the decision by India and Pakistan to\nsign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT). We have no particular lesson for those\ntwo great countries, which are our friends. But it is clear\nto us that the possession of atomic bombs cannot offer\neither of them a lasting victory; only a prosperous country\nand people can confer that.\nHumanity will continue to be under threat until the\ncurrent stockpile of nuclear weapons is destroyed. The\nmajor nuclear Powers must today admit this self-evident\ntruth.\nWhile nuclear weapons pose a permanent danger to\nus all, small arms in my country sow permanent\ninsecurity and hamper our economic development efforts.\nLast May a group of heavily armed gangsters attacked a\nbank in broad daylight right in the middle of Cotonou,\nkilling security guards and making off with tens of\nmillions of francs. If small arms were not available, such\nincidents and armed conflicts would certainly be less\n18\n\n\ncommon, and outlaws would not be as terrifyingly effective\nas they are today in numerous countries where ill-equipped\npolice and militias cannot resist them. The massacre must\nbe stopped, first and foremost by dealing with those who\nare primarily responsible \u2014 the producers and exporters of\nsmall arms.\nThat is why Benin supports the conclusions of the\nInternational Conference on the Proposed Moratorium for\nSmall Arms Transfers in West Africa, which was held in\nOslo, Norway, from 1 to 2 April 1998.\nIt has been said that a hungry man is not a free man.\nI have spoken at length about arms, conflicts and wars\nbecause, basically, my delegation is hopeful that by banning\nthe former we can more easily end or at least diminish the\nlatter.\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, it is important to emphasize\nthat the affirmation of human rights must go hand in hand\nwith the eradication of poverty. We cannot speak seriously\nabout human rights, liberty or democracy in a country\nwhere the people have neither bread nor schools.\nMy country hopes that bold and vigorous measures\nwill be taken, particularly by the richest countries, so that\nthose whom globalization leaves inexorably by the wayside\ncan be given a chance to enter the twenty-first century with\na little more hope. The bold measures must relate in\nparticular to the issues of debt and the allocation of\nadditional resources for development.\nLike many other countries in Africa, Asia and\nAmerica, the Republic of Benin has taken control of its\ndestiny by carrying out reforms that have often proved very\ndifficult. Even if our development partners are standing\nbeside us, these reforms and efforts express first and\nforemost the desire of our States and our peoples to take\ncharge and to emerge from underdevelopment and poverty.\nAnd we have begun to obtain results. In my country, for\nexample, economic growth has now surpassed demographic\ngrowth.\nWe must carry our burden even if we have to do so\non our knees; we must not let it fall. I therefore call upon\nall those responsible for making economic decisions at the\nglobal level to support more vigorously the efforts of\ncountries whose burden has brought them to their knees.\nIn this context, I should like to reaffirm the\nimportance that the Government of Benin attaches to the\noperational development activities of the United Nations\nsystem, which, we are pleased to say, are aimed at\nenabling the recipient countries to take control of their\nown development. We believe that the decline in\ncontributions to core resources for funds and programmes\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF)\nand the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is a\ndangerous handicap. The Government of Benin hopes that\nthe donor countries will demonstrate greater solidarity by\nincreasing the resources that they allocate to those\ninstitutions.\nNevertheless, I should like to thank all of the funds,\nprogrammes and specialized agencies of the United\nNations whose technical and financial support in the past\nfive years has been decisive in enabling us to pursue\nprogrammes aimed at constructing a State based on the\nrule of law and building a prosperous nation in which all\nthe citizens of Benin can have a minimum of their\ncommon social requirements met. I should also like to\nwelcome all the initiatives of the United Nations system,\nwhich have long been working for the development of\nAfrica, as well as the actions of all our development\npartners, in particular Japan, which have ranked the\ndevelopment and economic recovery of the continent\namong their priorities.\nAlthough they may be positive and praiseworthy,\ninitiatives to benefit Africa must henceforth meet the\nfundamental needs and priorities of the African countries.\nIt is in this spirit that in several days? time Benin will be\nparticipating in the second Tokyo International\nConference on African Development (TICAD II). Our\nhope, which many others share, is that that Conference\nwill go beyond the declaration that will no doubt be\nadopted and lead to a programme of concrete action\naimed at finding solutions to the problems of the\ncontinent at the close of the twentieth century.\nAt the beginning of my statement I referred to the\nspirit of tolerance and sharing. I believe that our\nOrganization is the pre-eminent forum in which we can\nlearn and refine this spirit. Despite all the criticism, the\nUnited Nations has, to date, proved irreplaceable. We\nmust continue to try to refine it and to carry out reforms.\nIn conclusion, therefore, I would like to reaffirm that\nthe reform of the United Nations, which was begun under\nthe bold initiative of Mr. Kofi Annan, deserves to be\n19\n\n\nsupported and developed so as to guarantee the necessary\nconditions for the harmonious pursuit of the process of\ndemocratizing international relations at the dawn of the next\nmillennium. If we want to begin the twenty-first century\nwith self-confidence, and if we want the efforts and\nsacrifices that have been made thus far on the tortuous and\nrugged path to development not to have been in vain, we\nmust do our utmost to focus greater attention on the\nprinciple of world partnership and the duty of solidarity,\nwhich is what the new international order necessarily\nimplies.\nThe twenty-first century may become one in which a\nblind global economy using the most sophisticated science\nand technology at the same time enslaves three quarters of\nhumanity. This must not happen. Let us act now so that the\nnext century can become the century of civilization par\nexcellence, the century of sharing and of solidarity, the\ncentury of culture and the century of peace. The Republic\nof Benin is ready to play its part in this necessary struggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation congratulates\nthe Secretary-General and his staff on their efforts to make\nthe United Nations more responsive to the needs of\nMember States and of the international community,\nespecially the developing nations.\nMy delegation also wishes to congratulate Mr. Didier\nOpertti on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. We also wish to thank\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the former Foreign Minister of\nUkraine, for his exceptional performance in the conduct of\nthe proceedings of the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe philosopher Thomas Aquinas admonished us thus:\n\u201cIt is better to light up than merely to shine; to deliver\nunto others contemplated truths, than simply to\ncontemplate.\u201d\nIn the context of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, in obedience to\nthat admonition by Aquinas, the Grenada delegation humbly\noffers to this noble Assembly, for its reflection, a few\ncontemplated truths in relation to human interaction within\nindividual societies, as well as among nations.\nIn his Lines Written in Early Spring, the poet William\nWordsworth wrote:\n\u201cI heard a thousand blended notes,\nWhile in a grove I sat reclined,\nIn that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts\nBring sad thoughts to the mind.\n\u201cTo her fair works did nature link\nThe human soul that through me ran;\nAnd much it grieved my heart to think\nWhat man has made of man.\u201d\nIn book I of The Republic, Plato made the\nobservation that\n\u201cMankind censure injustice fearing that they may be\nthe victims of it, and not because they shrink from\ncommitting it.\u201d\nAnd Michael de Jouvenal, in his foreword to a\ntwentieth century work on the history of the disintegration\nof ancient Greece, urges that\n\u201cwe study history to learn from history, to acquire\npolitical prudence\u201d.\nThe ideal of peace among the nations of our world\nhas twice during the course of this century inspired the\ninstitution of a body to moderate, if not regulate,\ninternational interaction. Regrettably, with respect to both\nof those initiatives, the focus was on the avoidance of war\nand not on the concept of peace, so insightfully\nadumbrated by Aquinas as the tranquillity of order.\nThe League of Nations collapsed ignominiously. It\nperished for lack of honour. It was unfaithful to even the\nrather limited principles upon which it had been founded.\nThe weak were sacrificed on the altar of expediency, in\nveneration of military might. So ended the first attempt at\nseeking to realize international peace through the pursuit\nof avoiding war. Continued appeasement and non-\ninvolvement then spawned the Second World War.\nYet, following the horrors of the Second World War,\nwhich prompted the setting up of the United Nations, the\nlate Winston Churchill, in persuading the British people\nand, indeed, the rest of the world, to join in the second\nattempt to pursue peace among nations, advised that\n\u201cTo jaw-jaw is better than to war-war\u201d.\nHistory records that we have not succeeded in\navoiding war.\n18\n\n\nAs we in the Assembly engage in the observation of\nevents among nations, as well as within them, the Grenada\ndelegation sincerely and humbly suggests that we should\nreflect on the question of why we have not examined\nrelevant history to acquire the relevant political prudence?\nCan it be that there still exists among us a\npredominating subscription to the notion that might is right?\nOr is it that there remains an overriding precept which\ndetermines the operations of the United Nations and its\nsubsidiary bodies: that wealth necessarily merits the\nenjoyment of special privileges \u2014 albeit to the significant\ndisadvantage of the less wealthy, and especially the poor?\nCan it be that such a precept continues to inform\nperceptions as to what is truly acceptable in relation to the\ncomposition of the Security Council and the veto?\nHistory attests to the human experience across the\nentire spectrum, in the context of the Pax Romana as well\nas the rule of recent empires.\nWhen will we acquire the political prudence to order\nhuman interaction, within and among nations, so that the\nresulting tranquillity will ensure that peace will prevail in\nour world?\nIt is with deep humility that Grenada suggests that\npeace among men and among nations will be realized only\nwhen human rights are truly respected and honoured\nuniversally. Indeed, Grenada submits that the several human\nrights which have been individually identified may all be\nencapsulated within a single enunciation: the right to the\nrealization of the fullness of human dignity on the part of\nevery person.\nIn this regard, Grenada expresses concern about the\nfate of the Kuwaiti prisoners whose human rights are being\nviolated as we speak.\nProminent among the causes of erosion of human\ndignity are poverty and deprivation in relation to the\nprerequisites for the sustaining of life. In this regard,\nphysical disablement warrants particular inclusion as a\nsignificant cause of erosion of human dignity.\nAccordingly, Grenada supports unequivocally the call\nfor the eradication of poverty from our world and urges that\nthis objective be pursued as a matter of urgency. Grenada\nexpresses deep concern over the sanctioning by the United\nNations of trade embargoes which include food and\nmedicines. Grenada humbly urges that this kind of mandate\nbe speedily revisited. As to maiming injury, Grenada\nurges that all anti-personnel landmines now in existence\nbe destroyed, and further production banned forthwith.\nMoreover, Grenada now repeats another of its earlier\nexhortations: that the battlefields of war, past and present,\nshould, as a United Nations sponsored project, be cleared\nof all weapons of war which still possess the potential for\ncausing injury and even death, to dumb animals or to\nman.\nIn narcotics there resides an extremely powerful\npotential for the erosion of human dignity. The voluntary\nuse of illicit drugs by individuals does not negate this\ndestructive potential. Indeed, such voluntary indulgence\nmerely hastens the transformation of latent potential into\nvirulent activity.\nAccordingly, Grenada urges the United Nations to be\nincreasingly unrelenting in its campaign against narco-\ntrafficking. Indeed, we suggest that the United Nations \u2014\nwith support as is appropriate in each case \u2014 sponsor\nnational programmes whose purpose is to eradicate the\nuse of illicit drugs by the pupils and students in our\nschools, and by all youths throughout our world.\nIn this regard, we applaud the drug abuse reduction\neducation (DARE) project and commend it for use\nthroughout the world, modified as may be most\nappropriate to particular circumstances.\nDisasters occur in many forms. Yet whether natural\nin origin or the product of human device, physical\ndisasters constitute a most significant threat to human\ndignity, as they do to human life.\nAs to natural disasters, humankind is aware of that\nthreat. Hence the awe experienced when we are\nconfronted by such disasters. That very feeling of awe,\nthough, may well, in its embrace, extend to an acceptance\nof the consequences as being inevitable \u2014 and less only\nin degree than the inevitability of the disaster itself. This\nmay well explain the inadequacies of actions for disaster\npreparedness which are so regularly observable. We must\nconfront this form of resignation.\nWe must also confront the deliberate and wilful\nhuman imposition of physical disaster.\nHuman dignity is assaulted also by economic\ndisaster. Recent experiences in the Far East, and the\ncurrent ones in other parts of our world, bear telling\ntestimony to this.\n19\n\n\nGrenada contends that the United Nations and its\nrelevant subsidiary bodies, as well as its appropriate\nagencies and agents, must, as a matter of conscience, revisit\nthe concept of globalization which has informed various\nregimes, especially in relation to trade of all kinds, which\nhave caused such degradation of human dignity and such\npain among the peoples of the world.\nTrade that is not informed by concern for humanness\ndoes not promote human well-being. Indeed, it cannot. For\nthe very ignoring of such concern is one of the hallmarks\nof a diabolical origin.\nOur world needs to be humanity-centred and\nhumanity-friendly. Grenada urges that we regulate the many\nsystems which together compose our global interactions.\nGrenada humbly invites attention to, and consideration\nof, the observations of an international non-governmental\norganization committee on human rights in trade and\ninvestment. By a letter dated 20 July 1998, the committee\ninvited our Prime Minister and our Foreign Minister to\nreflect on some potential threats to our people\u2019s enjoyment\nof their human rights. The potential for these threats resides\nin one or another of the multilateral investment agreements\nand the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements.\nFive such threats were identified, and we accept the\nvalidity of the arguments adduced in each case.\nNonetheless, only three are presented here so as to\nstimulate curiosity, and thus further contemplation.\nFirst, the human right to self-determination embraces\nthe right of all peoples to determine their economic future.\nThis subsidiary right may well be frustrated, if not denied,\nwhere freedom is given to foreign investors to operate\nwithout a requirement of social responsibility to the overall\ncommunity in which they do business.\nSecondly, pursuance of the concept of non-\ndiscrimination in trade and investment may well militate\nagainst the pursuit of governmental policy to eliminate\nunjust discrimination, on the one hand, and, on the other, to\npromote the relaxation of equality on the part of vulnerable\ngroups.\nThirdly, stipulated conditions in favour of foreign\ninvestors may very well be inimical to the right to realize\nthe fullness of one\u2019s human dignity.\nEarth, with its physical environment, is a divine gift to\nall the people of the world, and there devolves upon all of\nus a collective responsibility to protect both our planet-\nhome and its environment. Further, we have been given\nauthority over the locality in which we choose to live \u2014\nsuch authority, however, not extending to destructively\nimpinging on any other similar locality, irrespective of its\nsize or population. Thus, every nation has the right to\ndevelop the resources of its territory, but not to the\ndetriment of the people of any other nation.\nAccordingly, to engage in the transportation of\nnuclear waste through the terrestrial or marine\nenvironments of other countries is to engage in violating\nthe human rights of the people of those countries. The\nsame is true of dumping toxic waste, or food considered\nin the country of origin or of processing to be hazardous\nto health, on the markets of the less developed countries\nof our world.\nAttention has already been invited in this\npresentation to the ignominious collapse of the League of\nNations, as well as to the cause of that calamity. Suffice\nit, therefore, simply to refer now to instances of\nmembership in the Untied Nations of both components of\nwhat hitherto were single sovereign States.\nThe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan \u2014\nand they number more than 22 million \u2014 have exercised\nthe right to participate in international organizations,\nincluding the United Nations. And in the further exercise\nof that right, they have chosen to contribute\ninternationally towards the realization by the peoples of\nthe less developed countries of the fullness of their human\ndignity. And the Republic of China on Taiwan has chosen\nto do so within the compass of certain regional and\ninternational organizations which are associated in one\nway or another with the United Nations system. To deny\nthose 22 million people the right to exercise that choice\nis to violate their human right to choose. Further, to\nengage in such denial is also to enforce a restriction on\nthe enjoyment of enhanced benefit by the peoples of\nStates which are members of those organizations.\nGrenada therefore calls for the granting to the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan of an appropriate form of\nmembership that would allow for participation by the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the World Health\nOrganization, the World Trade Organization and the\nCaribbean Development Bank.\nGrenada does not condone terrorism. Indeed, we\ncondemn it, whosoever the perpetrators may be. In so\ncondemning terrorism, we are especially mindful of the\n20\n\n\nvicious action-reaction spiral relating to engagement in\nterrorist activity, whose viciousness increases with each\ncycle. And in this latter regard we perceive as engaging in\nterrorism any action that is calculated to strike terror into\nthe minds and hearts of people anywhere.\nQuite early in this presentation, reference was made to\nAquinas\u2019s concept of peace. But no attention has yet been\ngiven here to the achievement of the tranquillity of order,\nwhich Aquinas defines as peace. Comment has, however,\nbeen made on aggression and violations of one kind or\nanother. Accordingly, it is fitting that this presentation\nshould end with a succinct elaboration of Aquinas\u2019s concept\nof peace, which it must be stated, is not taken from any of\nthe works of Aquinas. Rather, it is taken from a little\nbooklet entitled Golden Moments, and this particular piece\nbears the caption \u201cIf there is\u201d:\n\u201cIf there is righteousness in the heart, there will\nbe beauty in the character. If there is beauty in the\ncharacter, there will be harmony in the home. If there\nis harmony in the home, there will be order in the\nnation. When there is order in the nation, there will be\npeace in the world\u201d.\nMay God bless everyone who participates in the\ndeliberations of this Assembly, whatever the business or\noccasion, so that this Assembly may truly be a blessing on\nour world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It\ngives me particular pleasure to congratulate Mr. Opertti\nmost warmly on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. Please allow me also to\njoin those who have expressed their appreciation for the\nwork done by the former President, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, during the past session.\nSince this is the first time that I am taking the floor in\nthis Assembly, I would like to express to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan our highest consideration and support for his\nactivity, especially for his efforts in promoting reform of\nand a new image for the United Nations.\nRomania believes that the role of the United Nations\nin contemporary international life remains essential, given\nthat, in the face of the new challenges to international\nsecurity, we can react in a coherent and efficient manner\nonly under the guidance of a unique system of values, such\nas that of the generally accepted principles of the United\nNations Charter, whose validity remains indisputable.\nMy country desires to participate actively in the\nprocess of redefining the role of the United Nations and of\nmodernizing its functioning, and it supports the reform of\nthe Organization as a whole.\nThe beneficial role of United Nations preventive\ndiplomacy, demonstrated these past years, as well as the\nnew approaches regarding humanitarian aid, peacekeeping\nand post-conflict reconstruction, are eloquent examples of\nthe usefulness of joint, coordinated action at the global\nlevel. Romania is actively involved in promoting these\nconcepts and trends and is participating, to the extent of its\ncapacity, in peacekeeping and peace-building operations.\nThe participation of Romanian soldiers in United Nations\npeacekeeping missions in Bosnia, Angola, Kuwait, Somalia\nor Rwanda represents our contribution to the\nimplementation of these concepts.\nThe political will of Romania to act as a factor of\nstability on the international level was proved once more\nyesterday when we signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding with the United Nations regarding stand-by\narrangements. This event, furthermore, supplements the\nrecent accession of Romania to the Multinational United\nNations Standby Forces High-Readiness Brigade\n(SHIRBRIG). The experience acquired in peacekeeping\noperations has highlighted the need to consolidate United\nNations rapid reaction capacity.\nRomania is profoundly concerned about the conflict\nsituations on the agenda of the Security Council and\nwould like to take this opportunity to advocate, once\nmore, dialogue among the parties concerned, in order to\nfacilitate solutions negotiated by those directly involved\nin the conflict.\nIt is essential not to lose the momentum for dialogue\nlikely to lead to peace, because there is always a right\nmoment for peace, just as there is also sometimes,\nunfortunately, a time which can lead to conflict. For\nexample, in our view the Middle East today is facing a\nunique chance for peace. If the parties involved do not\ntake advantage of this opportunity, the crisis might\ncontinue indefinitely. Let us do our utmost to avoid an\nunfortunate \u201ctoo late\u201d situation. We were on the verge of\nacting too late in Bosnia, in Northern Ireland, and we still\nrun this risk in Kosovo.\nThe evolution of the crisis in Kosovo remains\nextremely worrying. Romania continues to stand for the\npeaceful settlement of this conflict, and we support the\nefforts of the international community in this direction,\nincluding those of the Contact Group, the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Beyond all doubt, the\ncountries in the region must be constantly consulted\nregarding measures that are to be taken for the settlement\nof the conflict.\nThe Balkans and, in a broader sense, South-Eastern\nEurope have, inter alia, an image problem. The inventory\nof local disputes gets more attention than the inventory of\nreal success stories. We forget that a number of these\ncountries have managed to make the transition from\ndictatorships and centralized economies to democracies\nand market economies. It is a difficult process but one\ncourageously undertaken by these countries. It is true that\nit is always up to them to improve their political\nimage \u2014 not by falsifying it, but on the contrary by\nrendering it more exact. There is the need for a certain\nregional pride, for a legitimate aspiration to show the\n14\n\n\nworld not only the spectre of intraregional conflicts, but\nalso a promising economic and cultural potential that\ndeserves every consideration and encouragement.\nRomania is particularly concerned about the still\nunresolved conflict situation in the eastern region of the\nRepublic of Moldova. We believe that there are serious\nreasons for concern about the lack of progress in solving\nthe two major problems of this region \u2014 namely, the\nwithdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the\nRepublic of Moldova, and the negotiation of the political\nstatus of the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova. We\nsupport the need for the resumption of negotiations on the\nstatus of this region and the urgent implementation of the\n1994 agreement on the withdrawal of the 14th Russian\nArmy from the territory of the Republic of Moldova.\nWe believe that the United Nations Security Council\nwill continue to play a crucial role in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. We support the reform of\nthe Council and want to have the discussions continued on\nequitable representation in the Council and an increase in\nits membership, with a view to finding generally acceptable\nsolutions. Our approach is also aimed at obtaining an\nadditional non-permanent seat for the Group of Eastern\nEuropean States.\nIn the context of increasingly diverse challenges to\ninternational security and the prevalence of non-military\nrisks, the role of the United Nations in other fields \u2014\neconomic, social and legal \u2014 is becoming more important\nthan ever. The economic and social dimensions of United\nNations activities offer even more opportunities for a\ncoherent and efficient management of dialogue and\ncooperation on global economic and social issues.\n\nThe high-level dialogue which recently took place in\nNew York on the economic and social impact of\nglobalization re-emphasized the need for a coordinated\napproach to economic interdependence and other\ndimensions of international security. An effective response\nto the present challenges requires the participation of all\nStates, as well as international financial and commercial\ninstitutions, in order to reach a new global financial\nbalance.\nIn a world of growing interdependence, the assistance\nprovided by the United Nations system is a good example\nof the coordinated way in which we can address the various\nproblems confronting us. Romania is developing effective\ncooperation with the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Children?s Fund\n(UNICEF) and other funds and programmes within the\nnew United Nations development assistance framework.\nThe Romanian Government would like to benefit more\nfrom United Nations assistance in priority fields in\nsupport of domestic reforms.\nThis year, the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives me this\nvery pleasant opportunity to refer to the human dimension\nof our activity. It also provides us all with an opportunity\nto reflect more broadly upon the interdependencies which\nexist between human rights and peace, development and\ndemocracy.\nRomania supports the role played by the United\nNations in asserting the universal nature of human rights\nand in consolidating the international system for the\nprotection of these rights in collaboration with\nGovernments and civil society.\nWe also wish to contribute to an active and efficient\nUnited Nations involvement in the fight against terrorism,\norganized crime and illicit drug-trafficking. In this\nrespect, we must take into account the fact that the global\ncharacter of these new threats requires a global approach\nso that mankind can tackle them in a responsible way.\nWe cannot afford the luxury of replacing effective action\nby endless debate or compassion by contemptuous\njudgement.\nWe should condemn terrorism without speaking of\nterrorist peoples or countries. We should condemn\nfanaticism without claiming that there are fanatic religions\nor denominations. We should encourage dialogue and not\nconfrontation, solidarity and not segregation. We have to\nwork for the unity of Europe without instituting various\ndegrees of \u201cEuropeanism\u201d, which could lead to arbitrary\ndivisions that separate and exclude rather than unite. We\nhave to encourage the spirit of cooperation and mutual aid\nand not the tendency to pass judgement on others. We\nshould not judge States for the undignified deeds of\ncertain citizens, nor peoples for the historic accidents\nimposed on them by abusive leaders or barbarian\nideologies. We should also refrain from condemning those\nwho have different views from ours and should not use\nthe name of democracy to encourage confusion between\npublic affairs and private, between the values of pomp\nand sincerity, between honesty and demagogy. We should\n15\n\n\nnot add to the confusion of the world by an ostentatious\nrelativization of acquired traditions and values.\nIn this context, Romania reaffirms its attachment to\nthe concepts of multiculturalism and tolerance of all kinds.\nAllow me to recall that an international conference\norganized by the community of Sant?Egidio was recently\nheld in Bucharest on the topic of peoples and religions.\nRepresentatives of all the major religions and\ndenominations of the world participated in this meeting. As\nmentioned in the message of Pope John Paul II, the success\nof the meeting testified to Romania?s mission as \u201can\ninterface between East and West, offering a genuine\nsynthesis of cultures and traditions\u201d.\nAt present, many countries of the world are\nundergoing the complex and unique experience of regaining\ndemocracy. That is why there is great interest in good\ngovernance, strengthening democratic institutions and\nenlarging the participation of civil society in the exercise of\ndemocracy.\nIt gives me great pleasure, in my capacity as Acting\nChairman of the Third International Conference of New or\nRestored Democracies, to bring to the Assembly?s attention\nthe fact that the ministerial meeting of the countries\nparticipating in that Conference took place a few days ago\nhere at United Nations headquarters. On that occasion, a\nnumber of measures were examined concerning the\nimplementation of the recommendations formulated in the\ndocument adopted last year in Bucharest. In this respect, we\nintend to present a draft resolution to the General Assembly\nwith a view to ensuring the follow-up to this process until\nthe next Conference.\nRomania highly appreciates the framework provided\nby the United Nations system, since it allows for the broad\nparticipation of all countries in all fields and enables the\nsearch for common interests that transcend national pride.\nPlease allow me to raise a few issues relating to\nRomania, a country engaged in the broad and difficult\nprocess of economic reform. For us, maintaining an\ninternational environment that is stable, predictable and\nstimulating to business and investment is central to\nfulfilling our economic reform programme.\nRomania?s fundamental option \u2014 that of European\nreintegration and membership in NATO \u2014 is well known.\nOur political objectives remain unchanged. Even if the rate\nat which these objectives are achieved varies from one\ncountry to another, we have no alternative. As we strive to\nreplace one system by another, we are encountering all\nthe difficulties of transition: low standards of living, the\nconfusion of values, a radical change of mentalities\nagainst the backdrop of social and administrative inertia.\nEverything has become a priority. Everything is\ncompulsory. Everything is urgent. This is why I feel we\nneed the support and encouragement of the international\ncommunity, to the benefit of democratization and\ndevelopment.\nWith regard to subregional cooperation, our\nexperience shows that crisis situations are generally seen\nsolely from the political, military and sometimes\nhumanitarian perspectives, but rarely or never from those\nof economics or civil society. Certainly, there are well-\ntargeted subregional projects, such as the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation and those relating to transport\nroutes linking the Caspian Sea to Western Europe, the\nancient silk route. But we have to recognize that South-\nEastern Europe lacks broad economic integrating projects\nthat are assisted by the main international institutions.\nIn the absence of such economic cooperation\nprojects, our policy is somewhat reactive. We also have\nto recognize that, in crisis situations, we still focus on\neffects and not on causes; we try to limit the damage and\nprevent the spread of the crisis, but do not focus on the\nprevention of conflict itself.\nIn our opinion, we should take better advantage of\nthe framework provided by the United Nations system in\norder to work out development-oriented political\nstrategies, in particular in the economic field. Similar\ndevelopments \u2014 leading, on the one hand, to solidarity\nand, on the other, to an ever greater diversity of the\nproblems that confront us \u2014 can also be noted in other\nregions of the world, not only in the Euro-Atlantic space.\nWe have followed them attentively and appreciate the\nresults obtained within the North American Free Trade\nAgreement, the Southern Cone Common Market, the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations and other\norganizations.\nAmong the priorities established by Romania, it is\nworth mentioning the objective of developing and\ndiversifying our political and economic relations with\ncountries of other regions, taking into account the\ncomplex and dynamic developments of an ever more\ninterdependent world under the impact of globalization.\nIn conclusion, allow me to assure the Assembly of\nthe commitment of the Romanian delegation to\n16\n\n\ncontributing effectively to United Nations activities in\nvarious fields towards the successful outcome of the current\nsession. We believe in the capacity of the United Nations\nto tackle the complex problems facing the international\ncommunity on the eve of the third millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of\nthe people and the Government of Sao Tome and Principe,\nand on my own account, I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session, and wish you success in carrying out\nyour duties.\nOn the occasion of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome\nand Principe would like to join with all other countries of\nthe world in advocating the cause of development, peace\nand liberty for all the world\u2019s people. We want also to state\nour deep concern at the grave problems which affect\nmankind and which pose a threat to the world.\nWe are one year away from the beginning of a new\nmillennium, and it is with sadness that we observe a\nworld deeply divided between North and South, rich and\npoor, and developed and underdeveloped countries.\nThe African continent continues its process of\nhealing and its struggle towards development. In recent\ndecades many countries of our continent have become\nindependent and democratic, and are ready for the open\nmarket. Some of them have experienced significant\neconomic growth. Economic reforms and democracy have\nmade them favourable ground for development.\nHowever, against this background, many African\ncountries have become poorer. Bad management and\nvarious types of crisis have given these countries very\nfew opportunities for development. In 1996, 240 million\nAfricans were living on less than one dollar per day.\nAfrica\u2019s share of international trade was only 2 per cent,\nand the continent received 2 per cent of foreign\ninvestment. Poverty is increasing, and political instability\nis creating violent conflicts which are very difficult to\ncontrol.\nWith deep sadness, we observe too many armed\nconflicts, such as those in Sudan, Somalia, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, the Great\nLakes region, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea and so on. Too\nmany lives have been lost; too much economic\ninfrastructure and too many homes have been destroyed;\ntoo many refugees have been created. That is the result of\narmed conflicts in our continent.\nThis situation merits the attention of all in order to\nprevent armed conflicts, by creating an environment for\ndialogue and reconciliation based on democratic\nprinciples, good governance and respect for the human\nrights of minorities.\nThe situation in Guinea-Bissau requires the special\nattention of the international community in order to\npromote dialogue between all the parties in conflict. We\nparticipated in negotiations as a member of the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, together\nwith the Southern African Development Community, and\nour mediation resulted in a ceasefire. We appeal to both\nparties to create a good environment to secure peace and\ntranquillity and restore the normal functioning of\ndemocratic institutions and respect for the Constitution.\n19\n\n\nAngola is also our concern. We call on the\ninternational community to avoid another war in that\ncountry. We also appeal to UNITA and to the Government\nof National Unity and Reconciliation, of which UNITA is\na part, to fulfil all the objectives of the Lusaka Protocol and\nwork for peace and development.\nThe situation in Central Africa and the Great Lakes\nregion is for us the most worrying in our continent. I do not\nwant to exaggerate, but I can say that this subregion is in\nflames which can spread into other countries. Our desire is\nto work together with the international community and all\ncountries in the subregion to seek a solution. Despite all the\napproaches already made to end the conflict peacefully, we\ncannot remain inactive while the conflict is widening, with\ncatastrophic consequences. The international community\nmust continue to work for peace to stop the suffering of\ninnocent people.\nBesides the conflicts on the African continent, there\nare others, such as that in East Timor. The East Timorese\npeople have been suffering under foreign occupation. They\nare fighting for self-determination, the right to freely choose\ntheir own destiny, in accordance with the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. If we deny them those rights, we contradict\nthe principles of our Organization. Against this background,\nwe reaffirm our support for the Maubere people in their\nstruggle for self-determination. We appeal to the United\nNations and the international community to continue\nsupporting the negotiations to reach a peaceful end of the\nconflict.\nThe world is facing serious environmental problems.\nThe development of programmes to protect our planet must\nbe a priority, and we must work together to avoid\nbehaviour that damages the environment by creating\npollution, land degradation and destruction in general. We\nneed to follow the Rio Declaration if we want a safe\nenvironment and sound development. We have to pay\nspecial attention to the problems of desertification, water\npollution, deforestation and biological diversity.\nI would like to call attention to resolution 2758\n(XXVI), adopted in 1971, which denied over 21.8 million\npeople their right to international representation and totally\ncontravenes the principle of universality, consecrated in the\nCharter. The admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nas one of our own would not pose a challenge to any of the\nexisting Members, and the peaceful coexistence of the two\nsides in this Organization would be a catalyst to end one of\nthe largest and most enduring sources of instability in Asia.\nTaking into consideration this and the changes that have\ntaken place in international relations, we call on the\nGeneral Assembly to review resolution 2758 (XXVI).\nFifty-three years after the United Nations was\nfounded, I would like once again to emphasize and praise\nthe positive contribution this Organization has made to\nfreedom, development and peace. The Organization faces\nmore and more challenges, and it is necessary and\nconvenient to proceed with reform of the system to make\nit capable of responding to the demands upon it. The\nreform must also include the Security Council; it is time\nto reform its structure to provide a better geographical\nrepresentation.\nIt is our understanding that a more democratic,\nefficient and less bureaucratic United Nations may better\nshoulder its obligations and carry out its duties, in order\nto guarantee progress and universal peace.\nThe struggle against organized crime, drugs, money\nlaundering and international terrorism must be one of the\npriorities of the United Nations and of all countries.\nEverybody must contribute to fighting these problems and\ntheir catastrophic consequences.\nMy country is facing a difficult moment in its\nhistory. The economy of Sao Tome and Principe has been\nundergoing deep changes. Statistical data show that there\nis a significant improvement. It seems that inflation has\nslowed; there is an improvement in the fiscal system and\nthe value of the national currency has risen.\nThe Government has been making efforts in order to\nachieve satisfactory results in the area of economic\ndevelopment and reducing poverty. One of our concerns\nis related to the problem of our high foreign debt,\nestimated at nearly $270 million and which is 54 times\ngreater than the value of our exports. Despite all the\nefforts that have been made, these numbers are still tragic.\nIt is essential for Sao Tome and Principe to benefit from\nhaving its foreign debt forgiven. It is very important for\nus to be able to participate in the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the United Nations\nand its specialized agencies for the support given to my\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The principality of Monaco is particularly\npleased that you, Mr. President, are carrying out the high\nfunctions and responsibilities of this fifty-third session of\nour General Assembly. Your election by acclamation\nbears witness to the confidence that the international\ncommunity has placed in your personal qualities and in\nyour experience. It is also a manifestation of the respect\nthat Member States have for your country, Uruguay.\nI would also like to include the newly elected\nmembers of the Bureau in my cordial congratulations to\nyou and in the wishes for success that I extend to you.\nIt is also a pleasant duty for me to pay a most\nearnest and sincere tribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nwho presided with such great talent and effectiveness over\nthe fifty-second of the Assembly.\nGeography often dictates the fate of a nation. This\nis particularly true for the Principality of Monaco, whose\nlife and development for centuries have depended on the\nsea. So it is that my country has always attached great\nimportance to all issues concerning the sea. In fact, we\nhost several institutions devoted to the marine\nenvironment.\nIn this International Year of the Ocean, it seems\nfitting to recall that the Principality is also celebrating the\none hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Prince\n10\n\n\nAlbert I of Monaco, one of the founders of oceanography,\nto whom our country owes a great deal of its renown.\nMy illustrious forebear, born in 1848, devoted a\nsubstantial part of his life to the scientific study of the\noceans. An accomplished and passionate seaman, he was a\npioneer during 30 years of scientific study that led him\nfrom the Azores to Spitzberg.\nPrince Albert I created in Monaco in 1910 the\nOceanographic Museum in order to share what he had\nlearned from his maritime expeditions and to reveal the\nbeauty and wealth of the marine environment. Previously,\nin Paris in 1906, he had founded the Oceanographic\nInstitute, which, in the same spirit, he devoted to teaching\nand research.\nHe was also a forerunner of oceanology, in that some\nof his work or his insights led to major medical discoveries,\nsuch as anaphylaxis and antibacterial action. By advancing\nresearch on what he called the meteorology of the upper\natmosphere of the oceans, he paved the way for studies of\noceanic atmospheric exchanges and their impact on climate.\nFollowing his example, we should encourage\nclimatological studies in order to prevent as much as\npossible such tragic flooding as that which \u2014 victimizing\ntoo many people \u2014 rages today in Bangladesh, in China\nand in the Chiapas region in Mexico. This is not to\noverlook, of course, hurricane Georges, which is now\nstriking the Caribbean islands with such force.\nIn responding to the wishes of the Ninth International\nOceanographic Congress, on 30 March 1910 Prince Albert\nI brought together a special commission to propose a\nprogramme for the scientific exploration of the\nMediterranean. Because of the First World War, the general\nconstitutive conference could not be held until 1919, in\nMadrid. In the presence of representatives of eight States\nwith coasts on the Mediterranean, the programme and\nworking methods of the international commission for the\nscientific exploration of the Mediterranean were established.\nThe comprehensive activities of this institution, unique in\nnature and mission, continue today. The institution brings\ntogether very high-level political leaders and scientists. Last\nJune in Croatia it held its thirty-fifth meeting. Prince\nRainier III, my father, who is now the Chairman, took that\nopportunity to again express his confidence in the scientific\ncommunity, encouraging it not to underestimate the\ninfluence it might have on political decisions, especially in\nthe area of maritime affairs.\nIt is in this spirit that we attach special interest to\nthe work conducted by the Independent World\nCommission on Oceans, under the leadership of the\nformer President of Portugal, Mario Soares. We hope that\nits conclusions, which are essential for the lasting\nconservation of our marine heritage, will receive all the\nattention they deserve.\nInspired by the scientific work of Prince Albert I,\nPrince Rainier III, my father, and his Government have in\nrecent years continued and strengthened his visionary\npolicy. Two examples are the scientific centre established\nin 1960 and the RAMOGE agreement signed with France\nand Italy so as to prevent all types of pollution \u2014 which\nare numerous in the Ligurian Sea.\nFurthermore, since last 27 March the Principality has\nhad a law that brings together in one legislative body all\nprovisions relating to the law of the sea, conforming them\nto the legal and technical requirements of the\ncontemporary maritime world \u2014 first and foremost to the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\nother relevant international instruments to which Monaco\nis a party.\nWe are also very much involved in activities carried\nout by the International Whaling Commission. Our efforts\nrecently led to the establishment of 40 degrees south as\nthe boundary of the new southern sanctuary designed to\nensure protection for the feeding and reproduction\ngrounds of 90 per cent of large whales. The Governments\naffected by this decision have committed themselves to\nlimit the number of so-called scientific hunting permits in\norder to protect effectively this sanctuary.\n\nI would like, furthermore, to draw the attention of\nthe General Assembly to fresh threats to the marine\nenvironment posed by new synthetic chemical products,\nsuch as dioxins and certain pesticides which affect the\nneurological and brain development of many species.\nLarge amounts of these products are now found in the\nflesh of fish and other marine vertebrates in the northern\nhemisphere, presenting an imminent threat not only to the\nbalance of marine biodiversity but also to the health of\nthe human race. I am thinking in particular of the Beluga\nwhales, now among the most poisoned animals on our\nplanet.\n11\n\n\nThe substantial contribution of Prince Albert I to\nprogress in oceanography should not allow us to forget his\nresearch in other areas, such as the study of prehistory.\nThanks to discoveries made in coastal caves, it has enabled\nus to identify one of the links in human evolution, which\nhas helped to establish scientifically the common origin of\nthe human race. These fossils, along with other\narchaeological objects found in the caves of the region, are\npreserved in the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology,\nwhich the Prince created in 1902 in Monaco. Just as he had\nestablished the Oceanographic Institute in Paris to promote\nmarine sciences, Prince Albert I gave the French capital an\nInstitute of Human Paleontology, where since 1910 courses\nhave been given and interdisciplinary research has been\nconducted on geology, prehistoric paleontology and\nethnography.\nLike many scholars, Prince Albert I did not limit his\nactivities to research. He felt the profound need for\ncommunication, teaching and propagation of knowledge. He\ngave talks in Italy, Belgium, Spain and Austria. He\ninaugurated congresses in Paris, Bordeaux and Washington.\nOne could also see him in the outskirts of the French\ncapital giving night classes to workers enrolled in the\nPeople?s University of Paris. Prince Albert I probably\nanticipated the immense enthusiasm with which at the\nbeginning of the 1960s men and women of all disciplines\nand a large part of the peoples of the world were to come\ntogether in favour of ecology \u2014 that is, respect for nature,\nits balance and the interdependence of the beings that live\nin it. Since the beginning of the century he had perceived\nsome of the bases for an environmentalism which was both\npopular and scientific and which he himself tried to put into\npractice.\nSo it is that his temple of the sea, the Oceanographic\nInstitute Museum of Monaco, was, on his initiative,\nsurrounded by superb gardens containing original and\nvaried Mediterranean species. Also very interested in\nbotany, he established on the rocky, arid coast of Monaco\nan exotic garden open to the public where we find\nsucculent plants, some very rare and endangered, preserved\nwith great care. My ancestor was to some extent a\nforerunner of those involved in the defence of biodiversity.\nA profound believer in justice and an ardent defender\nof universal friendship, Prince Albert I in 1903 also created\nin Monaco the International Institute for Peace, where he\nbrought together jurists, economists, philosophers and\nscientists to whom he assigned the mission of considering\n\u201cways of solving disputes between nations, propagating\ndedication to methods for bringing about harmonious\nunderstanding, and eradicating hatred from the hearts of\npeoples\u201d. Forty-two years later these words echoed in the\npreamble to the United Nations Charter adopted in San\nFrancisco.\nThe Academy for Peace and International Security,\nwhich meets regularly in Monaco, perpetuates, on the\ninitiative of my father, the reigning Prince, the\ndetermination of Prince Albert I to promote research on\npeace and the causes of conflict as well as the study of\nwar. Its thirtieth session, which I was pleased to open on\n19 March, devoted its work to globalization and\ninternational security. The discussions were led by high-\nranking personalities from the worlds of diplomacy,\ndefence and business, as well as by representatives of\nmajor international organizations. Its recommendations\nand conclusions essentially deal with the risks of tension\nand conflict inherent in the globalization of the economy\nand the best ways to overcome these risks.\nThe interest in humankind expressed in his research\non primitive man and his environment, his commitment\nto scientific knowledge and its spread, his rejection of\nviolence and his tireless fight for peace and respect for\nnature are all very contemporary messages which Prince\nAlbert I bequeathed to us. This was the meeting of a\nhuman life with history, and his multidimensional legacy\nhas come to us through time. He has influenced the minds\nof the people of Monaco, generation upon generation, in\nmaking us a welcoming, peace-loving people, respectful\nof our environment. Enriched by and adapted to world\ndevelopments and progress by his successors, primarily\nmy father, this heritage is now at the core of essential\nmissions which we have entrusted to the United Nations.\nMy country, within its modest means, is more prepared\nthan ever to make its experience, inherited from its\ndifficult past, available for understanding and\nrapprochement.\nThe defence of human rights and respect for human\ndignity, which are inscribed in letters of gold in the\nUnited Nations Charter, were no doubt of inspiration to\nPrince Albert I when he personally committed himself to\nthe rehabilitation of Captain Dreyfus and when he decided\nto grant constitutional political rights to his subjects in\n1911.\nThese fundamental human rights are being\ncommemorated by the international community today.\nThis is a great event. Fifty years ago, on 10 December\n1948, our General Assembly at its third session, held in\nParis at the Palais de Chaillot, adopted the Universal\n12\n\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights. One of those primarily\nresponsible for it, the French professor Ren\u00e9 Cassin,\nreceived in 1968, 20 years after the solemn proclamation,\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. This commemoration should be an\nopportunity for collective soul-searching. To what extent\nare human rights enjoyed internationally? Above all, what\nis the position with regard to the initiatives taken to realize\nthe right to development, which was officially recognized\nin 1993 by the international community at the World\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna?\nThe current fierce economic competition which is\naggravating macroeconomic imbalances is not without an\nimpact on the enjoyment of human rights. While respect for\ncivil and political rights seems to be less affected,\neconomic, social and cultural rights underpinning the right\nto development have made only modest progress \u2014 where\nthey have not, indeed, met with major setbacks.\nThe current financial crisis is depriving millions of\nmen and women of their basic rights, when not actually\ndestroying their lives. At the world level, it has led to an\noverall drop in life expectancy, an increase in infant and\nmaternal mortality, greater unemployment, growing\ninsecurity, uncontrolled migration and a grave deterioration\nin social welfare, accompanied by a relentless drop in\nincome among the active population. The high-level\ndialogue on the theme of the social and economic impact of\nglobalization and interdependence and their policy\nimplications, which was held in this Hall on 17 and 18\nSeptember, clearly stressed these facts.\nHuman rights are indissoluble. They must be enjoyed\nby everyone everywhere. As the General Assembly\nproclaimed on 10 December 1948, they are a common\nstandard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. The\nhighest authorities of my country, along with the entire\nMonegasque people, are thoroughly convinced of this.\nOne thought comes to mind. It may be a lengthy one,\nsince the question is delicate and quite complex. The\nGovernment of the Principality is perfectly well aware that\nurgent and concrete steps must be encouraged at the\nnational and global levels. Mrs. Mary Robinson, the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, has our full support and\nall our confidence. We know how difficult her task is and\nhow pitiful are her resources in the face of reality.\nThe Principality of Monaco also attaches the highest\nimportance to the tireless and courageous work of the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, which, I am pleased to recall, received the Nobel\nPeace Prize nearly 45 years ago in 1954. Mrs. Sadako\nOgata and her colleagues deserve our support and respect.\nThe United Nations humanitarian activities, which\nare necessary today as never before, and its efforts to\neliminate anti-personnel landmines and the human tragedy\nthey entail also deserve our greatest encouragement.\nI wish here to emphasize the special interest which\nmy father, the Sovereign Prince, and I, President of the\nRed Cross of Monaco \u2014 currently celebrating its fiftieth\nanniversary \u2014 attach to respect for and strict\nimplementation of the Geneva Convention relative to the\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12\nAugust 1949. Despite the tireless efforts of the\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nSocieties, as well as of many humanitarian organizations\nthat I wish to commend here for the altruism and courage\nof their members, we note an increase in serious\nviolations of this text, as well as of the most basic human\nrights of the most vulnerable sectors of the population,\nincluding children.\nLast June, the Security Council rightly expressed its\ngrave concern at the terrible consequences to children of\narmed conflict. It energetically and unequivocally\ncondemned the abuses to which they are subject,\nespecially the humiliations, outrages, sexual violence,\nkidnapping and displacements, as well their recruitment\nand use in combat, in violation of current international\nlaw. The authorities of Monaco unreservedly share that\nposition and are prepared to lend active support, to the\nextent of their abilities, to the Secretary-General?s Special\nRepresentative for Children in Armed Conflict so that he\nmay fulfil his noble mission.\nUnfortunately, the fate of children may be equally\ntragic outside armed conflict. Following the World\nCongress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of\nChildren, held in Stockholm in August 1996, the\nGovernment of Monaco, as I stated to the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session, has striven to reform its\ncriminal legislation in order to bring it into line with its\ncommitments. In implementation of article 34 of the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, to which Monaco\nis Party, new legislative provisions have been enacted,\nwith broader scope to criminalize to the greatest possible\nextent the sexual exploitation of children to satisfy the\nvices of others.\nThe establishment, last July in Rome, of an\nInternational Criminal Court is a source of great hope.\n13\n\n\nThis represents major progress, a far-reaching change in the\ninternational order that fosters respect for the essential\nprinciples of humanitarian law. Its Statute, adopted by a\nlarge majority, opens the way to the prosecution of war\ncrimes and the most heinous crimes against humanity, many\nof which affect children, of course, but also woman and the\ndefenceless elderly. The Principality of Monaco, which\nparticipated in the Diplomatic Conference in Rome,\nwelcomes this historic decision.\nThe Royal Government is grateful that such weighty\nissues as the definition of crimes, the principle of\ncomplementarity, jurisdictions, the independence of the\nprosecutor?s office and relations with United Nations organs\nwere all solved satisfactorily.\nI also wish to express on behalf of my country our\ngreat satisfaction at the work which the Secretary-General\nhas done in recent months. The reports he submits to us\nnote progress in many areas, including administrative and\nfinancial management and the restructuring of the\nSecretariat. Outstanding progress has been achieved thanks\nto the trusting and close cooperation he has established with\nrepresentatives of Member States and with officials of the\nmost influential international world and regional bodies.\nHis diplomatic initiatives, carried out with great\nwisdom, patience and determination, have often been\ncrowned with success, despite the obstacles and difficulties\nhe has encountered. We are especially pleased that, in come\ncases, his initiatives have allowed us to prevent or stabilize\nconflicts that might otherwise have been extremely\ndevastating.\nThe Secretary-General?s well-written and incisive\nreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa has\nriveted our attention. It is a valuable source of inspiration\nand ideas for bringing peace to Africa.\nIn this respect, I cannot fail to recall that we are\ncommemorating this year the fiftieth anniversary of\npeacekeeping operations. It was in 1948 that the first\nUnited Nations observer mission was established. I take this\nopportunity to pay a tribute to all those men and women\nwho have served under the United Nations flag and to\nsalute the memory of those who gave their lives in the line\nof duty. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld was among\nthem. More recently, in Kabul, an Italian Lieutenant\nColonel was killed and a French military adviser wounded.\nThe Convention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel, adopted by the General Assembly at\nits forty-ninth session, is more relevant than ever. Ten\nyears ago, on 10 December 1988, United Nations\nPeacekeeping Forces received the Nobel Peace Prize. As\nI see it, this high distinction should be recalled on the\noccasion of this anniversary.\nI would like to express great sadness felt in my\ncountry over the accident of Swissair flight 111. My\nsaddest thoughts go to the victims of that accident, some\nof whom belonged to the great United Nations family. We\nshare the grief of their loved ones.\nAfrica and Europe have recently experienced a tragic\nseries of terrorist attacks that have taken a toll of\nhundreds of victims including women, children,\nelderly people, many of whom were present merely by\nchance. Those attacks have given rise to an inevitable\nescalation of the use of force and an increased risk of\nconflict. The authorities and people of Monaco have felt\nthese painful events very deeply. Through me, they wish\nto reaffirm to the Governments concerned and to the\nfamilies of the victims their solidarity and their deepest\nsympathy.\nOn 13 August 1995, the Security Council firmly\ncondemned acts of terrorism, which they called an\noutrage. It recalled its statement of 31 January 1992,\nissued at its high-level meeting of heads of State and\nGovernment. The Principality of Monaco agrees fully\nwith that position. It is perfectly aware that terrorism\nendangers not only the security of States and their\ncitizens, but also international cooperation and peace. My\ncountry is more convinced than ever of the need to\nstrengthen international cooperation, with a view to\ncombating more effectively this scourge, which is a\nserious and tragic setback in relations among human\nbeings, nations and peoples. It fully endorses the\nprovisions of General Assembly resolution 52/165,\nadopted on 15 December 1997, and its provisions aimed\nat the elimination of international terrorism.\nOur Government is now considering the possibility\nof adhering to the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, which was adopted\nlast year without a vote and which is currently open for\nsignature. Furthermore, we hope that negotiations under\nway on a draft convention on the suppression of acts of\nnuclear terrorism will be concluded quickly.\nIn conclusion, it is my hope that the work of this\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly will be\ncrowned with success and that the activities of the\n14\n\n\nOrganization will be strengthened in such vital areas as\ninternational security, disarmament, sustainable development\nand the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I would also like to thank the\noutgoing President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his\nimportant contribution to the debates of the fifty-second\nGeneral Assembly.\n22\n\n\nWe are now celebrating the fifth anniversary of the\nadmission of Andorra into the United Nations. It is\ntherefore fitting to begin my speech today with an\nassessment of what motivated Andorra?s entry into the\nUnited Nations and the tasks that its Government has\naccomplished. Andorra wanted to become a part of the\nOrganization in 1993, immediately following approval by\nthe Andorran people of a modern Constitution that affirmed\nits sovereignty and brought to modern times thirteenth-\ncentury texts, texts which had guaranteed independence and\nneutrality for more than seven centuries. Andorra?s\ninternational standing required it.\nNevertheless, neutrality has never signified for\nAndorra isolation or a lack of self-determination. To the\ncontrary, during times of great European conflicts, and\nduring the Spanish civil war, Andorra opened its doors to\nthose who fled terror and violence.\nBeing a sanctuary of peace for so long has given\nAndorra certain international responsibilities, enumerated in\nthe new Constitution of 1993, which says that the Andorran\npeople shall persevere in the advancement of values such as\njustice, democracy and social progress, and keep and\nstrengthen the harmonious relations of Andorra with the\nrest of the world, based on mutual respect, coexistence and\npeace in the desire to bring its strength and collaboration to\nall the common causes of mankind.\nThe entry of Andorra into the United Nations has been\na most important step for our country, giving us the\nopportunity to make ourselves heard, to express ourselves\nand to be a part of the forum which includes all countries;\nwe must respond with solidarity, aid and our best efforts to\nattain peace, liberty and full adhesion to the International\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\nI am speaking in Catalan, the language of Andorra. It\nis an old Latinate language, an important part of our\ncultural identity, and it is an honour to speak these words\nin this language to the Assembly today. It is also proof of\none of the most difficult rights to assume: the right of\ndifference.\nIn Andorra, protected by the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es mountains, we\nare proud of our 720 years of uninterrupted peace and self-\ngovernment. We have a population of over 65,000,\ncomposed of more than 60 nationalities. We have acquired,\nwith the passage of time, certain experience in conjugating\nthe verb \u201cto tolerate\u201d, because of the diversity of our\npopulation, of which \u201cAndorrans\u201d are a minority, the\nimportance of immigration and the plurality of nationalities,\ncultures and languages. These are facts, which conform to\nmodern societies.\nPermit me to expand on certain aspects of our\ncountry in order to emphasize our desire to cooperate in\nshared projects and to struggle against aggression and\nrepression, and for harmony between peoples, cultures\nand civilizations. The particular sentiment that our little\ncountry feels before this Assembly is appreciation of the\ndifference between globalization and particularity, the\nparadox between material progress and world poverty.\nOur confidence in this Assembly is absolute, and I\nshall give two reasons. First, we consider here the grand\nstrategies we can adopt to pursue justice, democracy and\nthe rule of law. Secondly, this Assembly is a common\nhouse, where all are equal under the law and all States\ncan express their concerns to the world in an international\nassembly.\nThe politics of Andorra at the United Nations inspire\nme to make a general reflection within this institution. In\nthe last few years, the directives of the Government of\nAndorra concerning United Nations reform have been\nvery clear: absolute adherence to the reform projects of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, since his\nelection, has worked to achieve the restructuring of this\nOrganization.\nI am pleased to say that Mr. Annan is aided in\nseeking to attain his goals by the Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral, who has helped him bring about his objectives,\nand I would like to congratulate Mrs. Louise Fr\u00e9chette,\nwho, in the months since she assumed her position, has\nhelped immensely in the difficult task of reforming this\ninstitution, employing all the skills of a person of her\ndiplomatic abilities.\nWith respect to the reform of the United Nations,\nAndorra has shown a desire for transparency and greater\naccess for the General Assembly to the workings of the\nSecurity Council. We would also like to make clear our\ndesire for an increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil, to reflect the increasing membership of the\nUnited Nations. The Working Group on the reform of the\nCouncil will sponsor debates and present alternatives, and\nwe will present our ideas.\nThe most important theme of my speech today is the\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Andorra has strengthened\nits political structures in the light, always brilliant of that\n23\n\n\n1948 Declaration, which indeed, is given form in our\nConstitution. Article 5 of this document incorporates it into\nthe judicial structure of the State in the phrase:\n\u201cThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is\nbinding in Andorra.\u201d\nThis Declaration, shared by so many States, should not\nbe seen as Utopian. The proliferation of publications and\nseminars concerning the analysis and investigation of\nhuman rights, understood more and more as a means of\nensuring a proper relationship between the individual, the\ncommunity and the environment, touch on the grand\nsystems of classic thought.\nThe practice is deceptive. At the international level,\nnone of us can ignore the paradox of great wealth\ncontrasted with the abuse, the aggression and the most\nsinister forms of cruelty without limits. Today we know\nmuch of what happens in the world and very probably\nmany of us know why. We cannot now return to ignorance,\nto lack of knowledge, to lies.\nIn a more immediate framework, we cannot argue that\nthings are getting better. How can we respect the individual\nand his fundamental rights if the proliferation of armed\nconflicts, racism, xenophobia and the marginalization of\nothers continues?\nTolerance and respect are not new terms, but they are\nkey concepts, which must be reinvented or rediscovered,\ngiven a greater significance and a universal application. Too\noften tolerance is confused with condescension, and respect\nwith bureaucratic formality.\nThe danger increases when we become blinded by\nabsolute truths and dogmatic positions which, in one way\nor another, lead to authoritarianism and exclusion, which\nare precisely the opposite of toleration and pluralism.\nThis is written in the third book of the Pentateuch,\nLeviticus:\n\u201cThou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge\nagainst the children of thy people, but thou shalt love\nthy neighbour as thyself\u201d. (The Holy Bible, Leviticus\n19:18)\nThese are old and perennial moral statements, which shape\nsociety, and which have always been universal values\nincorporated in all the great statements on human rights.\nOn 10 December we will celebrate the passing of 50\nyears since the signing of the Declaration. It has become\na banner of this body, and it gives it reason to exist and\nto work.\nThere remain much work to be accomplished and\nmuch evil to be fought. We are far from any moment of\nsatisfaction. This century, which is about to end, contains\nfew events of which we can reflect with satisfaction. The\nworld has witnessed campaigns of extermination,\nholocausts and wars. It has all been extremely cruel and\nbloody. We can still see this black light in countries\nwhere assassinations take place under the guise of\nredressing religious grievances.\nMany other examples can be cited to show that the\nuniversal application of human rights has not been\nachieved, and we feel the same sense of powerlessness\nwhen we see our friends and neighbours in the\nMediterranean dying on the southern borders of Europe.\nThose who survive are lifted out of the opulence of\nEurope and deported, after false hopes and impossible\ndreams, back to the misery of their places of origin. This\nalso occurs, among other places, on the Adriatic coast.\nThe Mediterranean is no longer the unifying sea that\nit once was. Rather it has been transformed into a barrier\nbetween the rich North, with its aging populations, and a\nSouth that, like Prometheus, is filled with misery \u2014 but\nalso with young and struggling people more than half of\nwhom are under 18. Can we not say, therefore, that a\nconflict is in the air? How far we have come from the\nstirring poem of Emma Lazarus, which, engraved on the\nbase of the Statue of Liberty, welcomed, with a door open\nto hope, the persecuted and the refugee.\nWill the justice system become a mere spectacle?\nEven great dignitaries of great democracies, elected in a\nclear-cut way, are denied strict respect for personal and\nfamily privacy. The death penalty is still in effect in\nmany countries. Child labour, child pornography, sex\ncrimes, abuse and mistreatment are everyday occurrences.\nFifty years of universal human rights mean that we\nhave rules by which to differentiate between good and\nevil, and a standard by which we can recognize the often\ninconceivably evil actions of those individuals or States\nwho live without letting others live. Now, since 1948, we\ncannot turn away: we know who respects and who does\nnot respect human rights.\n24\n\n\nThe 1998 report of Amnesty International is once\nagain the faithful portrait of a planet which is capable of\nimmense technological progress and scientific advances that\nwe can scarcely imagine, a planet with the ambition to\nconquer interstellar space, but nevertheless continues to be\na world of terrible crimes. I do not believe that this should\nbe an anniversary during which we offer only\ncongratulations; we should also reflect critically on how we\nmight effectively achieve respect for human rights. It is\nobvious that all of us here today have a clear understanding\nof the universality of human dignity: it is the most\nfundamental and absolute of rights. We possess faith in the\nhuman being as the means of political action and the giver\nof concrete meaning to personal liberty and the freedom of\nsocieties.\nDemocracy is a synonym for ironclad respect for\nhuman rights, without concessions, as the greatest guarantee\nof liberty and progress. What excuse could exist today for\ndefending the notion that people do not have the capacity\nto elect public officials and to send them home through\nregular elections when those people believe that the\npoliticians have not done well enough? It is clear that\ndemocracy is vulnerable when there is no sincere consensus\non the rules of the game, and that this will lead directly to\ntotalitarianism, corruption and manipulation.\nGlobalization is not only an economic phenomenon:\nwith globalization, people have seen large States flower\nwith democracy, and have seen that oppressive and\nauthoritarian regimes do not lead to lasting economic\nsuccess, as some have claimed.\nMany institutions have made excuses for sins\ncommitted 500, 100, or 50 years ago. Must we wait half a\ncentury to apologize for the barbarous acts we commit\ntoday? We all bear responsibility. We should not respond\nonly with words and good intentions, especially if we\ndeclare ourselves to be powerless before injustice and\nmisery. Action by States will be the only acceptable\nresponse, for even if every citizen of the world could\ncooperate, we would still require force and the necessary\ninstruments.\nWhat can Andorra, a small State, bring to this world\nbody? Since 1993, my country has made a great legislative\neffort to accede to a large number of conventions, which\npermits us to participate in the rule of international law.\nFrom the point of view of security, Andorra desires to\naccede promptly to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, with international solidarity as our goal.\nOur humanitarian tradition made us one of the first\ncountries to have ratified the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction.\nIn the domain of international law, our presence at\nRome during the negotiation of the treaty on an\nInternational Criminal Court was marked by active\nparticipation in the writing of the text, notably the first\nparagraph of the statute. I would like to thank all\ndelegations who helped with the Andorran contribution,\nand particularly the United States of America.\nTurning to international human rights legislation, we\nhave over the years endorsed many human rights\nprovisions. Andorra will accede to the Council of Europe\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms, which includes the abolition of\nthe death penalty. We are also a party to the European\nConvention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment. At the United\nNations, we give priority to the Convention on the Rights\nof the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women.\nI have the pleasure today to announce that I have\ntaken the necessary steps to accede to other human rights\ninstruments of which the Secretary-General is the\ndepositary, in particular the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights and the Convention against\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment.\nWe are concerned too about universal problems such\nas terrorism, which must be combated without concession,\nand illicit drug trafficking and the associated money-\nlaundering, which must be prosecuted relentlessly.\nInternational cooperation and mutual assistance are the\nproper tools for this fight.\nFrom a financial point of view, our per capita\ncontribution is substantial, and we shall continue to\ncontribute to United Nations funds relating to human\nrights, development and peacekeeping.\nIn the field of preventive diplomacy, I insist on the\nimportance of words and diplomatic relations in moving\nthe world forward, and on the implementation of the\nmemorandum of understanding successfully negotiated by\nthe Secretary-General last February on weapons\n25\n\n\ninspections in Iraq; our Ambassador is a member of the\nSpecial Group on Iraq?s presidential sites.\nI believe that small countries without enemies or\nhistorical conflicts are in a favourable position to conduct\ndiscreet diplomacy and to play a mediation role to help\nensure that important negotiations stay on track.\nIn five years on the international stage, Andorra has\nfound its place in the concert of nations, and we are very\nproud to belong to this Organization. At the United Nations,\nwe have learned much from excellent teachers about how\nto go from the realm of the national to the international and\nfrom there to the universal. Andorra affirms before you its\nbelief in human rights, at the same time as we stand for\nworld security, peace and preventive diplomacy.\nDuring the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\nAndorra will maintain this position and will work to\nparticipate in the reform of this international Organization,\nfor now is the moment, at the beginning of the new\nmillennium, to reinvigorate the United Nations, to make it\na more effective instrument of order on this increasingly\nglobalized planet.\nToday no one is innocent; we all share the same\nresponsibilities. We wish to participate actively with all the\nMembers in tackling the task of building for a better age in\nan imperfect world in which all the peoples of the world\nare increasingly interdependent and increasingly demand,\nwith greater determination and courage, the universal\napplication of human rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I am pleased to extend to\nMr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. I am confident that his experience and skill will\nhelp ensure that we achieve the best results possible in\nour proceedings this session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\nmy appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his\n5\n\n\nnotable success in guiding the proceedings of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. It am also pleased to\nexpress thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his unceasing efforts to reform the\nUnited Nations and to enhance its credibility while\nstrengthening its role in maintaining world peace and\nsecurity.\nThe aspirations of the world?s peoples and States to\nachieve stability based on security, peace, prosperity and\nadvancement, which are basic objectives of the international\ncommunity, impose upon us the duty, year after year, to\ntake a realistic account, in this international forum, of the\nconfigurations of international realities for which the United\nNations serves as the most credible gauge and the most\ncomprehensive reference point for changes in various fields.\nThis would enable us to assess together how close we are\nto, or how far we are from, our basic human objectives.\nDevelopments in recent months and weeks in various\nparts of the world, and their implications and effects at\ndifferent international levels, have demonstrated that,\ndespite all the efforts made, this world is a long way from\nachieving the stability desired. They also demonstrate that\nno single Power, nation or bloc, however powerful or\ninfluential, can distance or protect itself from instability,\nwhich is rampant in the world, unless situations in the\nnorth, south, east and west are approached in a unified,\nconsensual and fair manner and with balance and\ninterdependence. This must be done in order to radically\nsolve problems and issues, addressing their root causes and\navoiding double standards and partial or temporary\nsolutions, and without deferring seemingly chronic\nproblems that are bound to rear their heads again in one\nform or another.\nThe failure of the international community to take\nproper advantage of the end of the cold war has been made\nmanifest by the nuclear arms race erupting in Asia,\nobstacles in the Middle East peace process, the rise of\nterrorism and other acts of violence committed\nindiscriminately in various parts of the world, as well as the\nworsening of economic crises in several regions.\nThe international situation is once again precarious,\nand it is incumbent upon all of us to treat these matters\ncomprehensively, and with greater firmness and\ndetermination. The increased gravity of the phenomenon of\nterrorism on the one hand, and the divergence of views\nregarding that phenomenon on the other, underline the need\nfor greater international understanding and more effective\njoint coordination. This calls for the need to convene an\ninternational conference at the highest possible level to\ncombat terrorism, for it is illogical to condemn terrorism\nat one level, while giving haven to persons involved in it\nat another level. Such an enormous task cannot be\nundertaken by any single State or bloc alone, whatever\nresources it may have. Thus we are once again faced with\nan enormous and renewed responsibility placed on the\nshoulders of our international Organization, which has\nnow been required, in the light of the new conditions and\nthe profound changes in the international environment, to\nadopt effective and unconventional working methods so\nas to confront these new and unprecedented situations in\nthe history of humankind.\nThis bestows a renewed importance and should also\ngive new impetus to both the United Nations reform\nprogramme put forward by the Secretary-General last year\nand to approaches to reactivating the performance of the\nSecurity Council in line with more effective formulas for\nits restructuring and functioning which may be acceptable\nto the international community within the United Nations.\nThese formulas should take into account equitable\ngeographical distribution and an appropriate increase in\nthe Council?s membership, commensurate with the\nincrease in the Organization?s membership. Bahrain takes\npride in the fact that at present it is the representative of\nthe Asian Group in the Security Council.\nExperience has shown that the end of an era, or\nvictory in a confrontation, does not mean the end of\ncrises or confrontations in the world, and that continuous\ninternational vigilance and permanent joint action are\nindispensable if we are to avoid inertia and prevent the\nrecurrence of such crises. Creative visions and innovative\nmethods to deal with new challenges are required. That\ndoes not mean that we have reached the end of history, as\nsome have imagined. Rather, it means that we have\nreached an unprecedented phase of history on the\npractical and political plane of the international situation.\nInsofar as the theoretical and intellectual aspects are\nconcerned, it is a fact that \u2014 however numerous may be\nthe views and interpretations in research and discussions\nin the world?s different cultures and civilizations that have\ncaptured the attention of the world in an unprecedented\nmanner in respect of the \u201cglobalization\u201d phenomenon and\nits dimensions and possible impacts, both positive and\nnegative \u2014 the United Nations, established over half a\ncentury ago, remains the indisputable mother institution\nfor this phenomenon. The United Nations represents an\nearly concretization of globalization in world history,\n6\n\n\ndespite the fact that globalization was not then as mature or\ncomprehensive as it is today.\nIf there is to be a global focal point qualified to carry\nout balanced and objective research on the dimensions of\nthis phenomenon whose impact is yet to be agreed upon,\nthis international Organization should be the common\nmelting pot for the various visions and diverging\ninterpretations concerning the globalization of the\ninternational scene, irrespective of the cultural, intellectual\nand spiritual directions of their proponents. This should also\nbe achieved in a manner whereby the fashionable phrase\n\u201cclash of civilizations\u201d can be transcended and replaced by\nharmony and dialogue.\nShould the United Nations, with its institutions and\nintellect, be unable to absorb this international phenomenon\nand its consequences for human and international reality,\nthis may lead to a different global reality that is\nincompatible with the spirit and philosophy of the\nOrganization. The result of such a situation might in the\nlong run become difficult to contain and control within the\nbounds of international legitimacy and existing international\ncooperation, as attested to by the increase in acts of\nterrorism and the breaches of established norms in more\nthan one field.\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations will be\nunable to meet historical and future obligations of this\nmagnitude, without adequate support from all its Member\nStates, whether at the level of financial obligations,\npractical facilities or, more importantly, political support for\nits programmes and plans. In the final analysis, the United\nNations is merely the sum total of the joint political will of\nMember States. This sum total, be it positive or negative,\nis but an expression of the capacity of that political will to\nundertake joint international action.\nIn spite of the apprehensions and risks that loom over\nthe international horizon, the future for the third millennium\nis laden with promises, hopes and potentials that are worthy\nof sacrifice and hard work for the sake of a better future.\nAccruing scientific and technological advancement, the\nincreasing speed of communications and the information\nrevolution, the spread of free trade and the deepening\ninteraction among nations, cultures and civilizations are all\nharbingers of a better world for all mankind.\nAs it witnesses these positive new developments on\nthe world scene, Bahrain, with its deep-rooted civilization,\nis hardly a stranger to this.\nFive thousand years ago, Bahrain was one of the\nmost important commercial ports in the world. By virtue\nof its openness, based as it was on freedom of commerce,\nit constituted a meeting place for cultures and human\nthought. Since that early time, by symbolizing the\nheritage of the old world regarding coexistence and\ninteraction between human contributions, it became\nqualified to be an island for peace and to be a civic and\nspiritual centre in its natural and human environment in\nthe Arabian Gulf. The existing legacy of its old\ncivilization bears witness to that.\nConsequently, and since the beginning of its current\nrenaissance, Bahrain has sought to meet the requirements\nof modern advancement in the areas of administration and\nmanagement, educational and cultural enlightenment and\nthe creation of an open and civilized society that is\ncapable of evolution based primarily on the Bahraini\nindividual?s innovation, capabilities and basic rights to a\nfree and honourable life. It has thus become a model for\nbalanced modernization that preserves the traditions of\nour region of the world.\nBy virtue of this distinctive role, the State of\nBahrain, small in size as it is, today bears a hefty regional\nand international responsibility on three levels\nsimultaneously: first, in its capacity as the financial and\nbanking centre of one of the world?s most important\neconomic areas; secondly, in its capacity as a fundamental\nlink at the forefront of the joint defence strategy of that\nvital region of the world \u2014 as has been the case\ncontinuously over the last half-century, coinciding with\nthe history of the United Nations; and thirdly, in its\ncapacity as a social, cultural and civic model that has,\nsince the beginning of this century, been open to modern\nthought and reforms and to progressive human\ndevelopment for both men and women equally in various\nfields of education and work, and in responsible social\nand national partnership. This has been reflected in this\nyear?s United Nations Development Programme Human\nDevelopment Report. That report placed Bahrain first in\nthe Arab world for the fourth consecutive year, for its\nachievements in human development. Furthermore, the\naccomplishments in the field of economic and industrial\ndevelopment in Bahrain reflect model diversification of\nthe means of production, which goes beyond an exclusive\ndependence on oil.\nAs it takes part in the United Nations celebrations\nmarking the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, Bahrain in fact does so as\na reflection of its real and historic contribution to the\n7\n\n\nbuilding of the social, educational and developmental\nfoundations for these basic human rights \u2014 the very core\nof the general structure of society \u2014 in a manner that\ntranscends slogans and efforts to politicize this venerable\nhuman issue. In addressing this issue, due consideration\nshould be given to the historical and legislative peculiarities\nand values of every society, religion and culture, so that the\noutlook of one system cannot predominate over the\nlegitimate and unique outlook of another.\nThe United Nations played a positive role in defusing\nthe crisis between Iraq and the international inspection\nteams earlier this year. The State of Bahrain welcomed the\nMemorandum of Understanding reached between the\nSecretary-General and the Iraqi Government. In view of our\nkeen interest in the preservation of security and peace in\nthe Gulf region, we applaud the effective role undertaken\nby the Secretary-General in defusing the crisis and sparing\nthe region from dangerous ramifications and consequences.\nWe wish to reaffirm the need for Iraq to continue fulfilling\nits international obligations concerning the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction and the release of Kuwaiti and\nother prisoners of war and detainees. Any progress in this\nrespect should be recognized as a first step towards the\nalleviation of the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people.\nThe State of Bahrain has always emphasized the need for\nensuring the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and the\nrejection of any interference in its internal affairs.\nThe continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of\nIran of the three islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and\nLesser Tunb, which belong to the United Arab Emirates,\nremains a cause of concern to the State of Bahrain and the\nother sister members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. We\nhope that ongoing contacts between the sisterly United Arab\nEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to the\nsettlement of the question of these islands by means of\nserious bilateral negotiations and other available peaceful\nmeans for the settlement of disputes among States through\nreconciliation.\nAs far as the general situation in the Gulf is\nconcerned, we, of course, welcome the easing of tension\nand the progress toward rapprochement and dialogue\nbetween the States members of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil and the Islamic Republic of Iran as being in the\ninterest of all their peoples and of the preservation of peace\nin that region.\nThe painful events in the Gulf region during the last\ntwo decades explain why the question of regional security\nremains one to which the State of Bahrain accords the\nutmost importance in view of its serious ramifications and\nrepercussions in relation to the security, stability and\nsafety of the States and peoples of the region. The\nterritorial and boundary claims currently seen in the Gulf\nregion, which aim at changing established and\ntraditionally accepted boundaries, upset the security and\nstability of the region. In our view, the optimal and most\njudicious course for avoiding that scenario is to respect\nthe status quo, to refrain from all claims, total or partial,\nand to settle any related differences by peaceful means\nacceptable to the parties to the dispute. The establishment\nof relations among the States of the region on the basis of\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of others and recognition of every\nState?s national sovereignty are also fundamental elements\nfor the maintenance of security and stability in the region.\nRegarding the Middle East peace process, this year\nhas not witnessed any positive developments or progress,\ndespite all the efforts to move the process forward. We\nbelieve that the lack of progress in the peace process will\nlead to an escalation of tension, extremism and violence\nin the region. Having supported the peace process since\nits very beginnings at the Madrid Conference as a\nstrategic option for the achievement of a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the region, Bahrain is\ndeeply concerned at the stalemate in the peace process\nresulting from the Israeli Government?s insistence on\nfollowing policies of procrastination, non-compliance with\ncommitments previously agreed upon with the Palestinian\nAuthority, and construction of more settlements both in\nHoly Jerusalem and in the Syrian Golan. That is in\naddition to the continued confiscation of land in the\noccupied Palestinian territories. Therefore, we call upon\nthe international community, and in particular the two co-\nsponsors of the peace process, to intensify efforts to\nrescue the faltering process, prevent its failure and put it\nback on the right course on all tracks so that just and\ncomprehensive peace may be attained on the basis of the\nprinciple of land for peace, the return to their owners of\nthe Palestinian territories, including in the first place Holy\nJerusalem, recognition of the right of the Palestinian\npeople to establish an independent State of its own on its\nnational territory, complete withdrawal by Israel from the\noccupied Syrian Arab Golan to the borders that existed on\n4 June 1967, in accordance with Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and the unconditional\nwithdrawal from occupied southern Lebanon in\naccordance with Council resolution 425 (1978).\nWith regard to the question of disarmament relevant\nto weapons of mass destruction, it should be recalled that\n8\n\n\nIsrael continues to avoid accession to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and a commitment\nto end a nuclear arms race in the region. Such a position is\napt to force other States to enter such a race, as has\nhappened in South Asia, and as could happen anywhere in\nthe world.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the world?s\nmultilateral trading system. Since the system was\nestablished, numerous rounds of multilateral trade\nnegotiations contributed to the creation of the World Trade\nOrganization. We hope that the forthcoming round of trade\nnegotiations, expected to begin before the end of the\ncentury, will lead to the creation of an environment\nconducive to the development and diversification of world\ntrade, and to the enhancement of economic and commercial\ncooperation among States on the basis of equality and\nreciprocal benefits.\nThe financial crisis that has afflicted a number of\nStates and regions has caused economic tremors and has\nvisibly affected the economies of numerous States, thus\naffirming the interdependence of the world economic\nsystem. In view of the consequences of this crisis, the\ninternational community must pay special attention to the\ntreatment of economic factors that have a bearing on world\ngrowth rates and find effective solutions to them.\nIt is our view that dialogue and cooperation between\nStates of the North and of the South with a view to\naddressing world economic conditions would enhance world\neconomic stability, lead to a greater flow of financial\nresources for development purposes and solve problems\nrelated to indebtedness, transfer of technology and the\npromotion of international investment.\nEnvironmental issues constitute a challenge that will\nface mankind during the twenty-first century. Concerted\ninternational efforts will be called for to address and\nprevent the dangers related to that challenge. Accordingly,\nthe State of Bahrain has endorsed the Protocol adopted by\nthe third session of the Conference of the Parties to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nheld last December at Kyoto, Japan. We look forward to\nthe fulfilment by the developed countries of their\nobligations under that Protocol.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, we view\nassertion of the importance of one civilization at the\nexpense of others as incongruous at the dawning of a new\nera, an era based on peaceful coexistence between\ncivilizations, their integration, their mutual enrichment, and\ntheir interaction with one another on an equal footing.\nThe experience of the United Nations since its\nestablishment has shown that variety and diversity of\ncultures are means towards fusion and harmony rather\nthan towards antagonism and divisiveness. Therefore, it is\nincumbent upon us, during the forthcoming period, to\nbuild relations among all nations, peoples, States and\ncultures on the basis of cooperation, consensus and\nunderstanding, rather than confrontation, hegemony or\ncollision. Let us together promote close and enduring ties\namong peoples and cultures in a world of interdependence\nand fraternity. Let national and cultural pluralism be\nelements of fruitful solidarity and mutual understanding\nin the creation of an era of peace and tranquillity.\nThis Organization, which over the last 50 years has\nguided mankind towards better understanding and greater\ncooperation and coordination, is capable of pursuing its\nhistoric role and undertaking a positive role in the\nongoing evolution of the international community\nthroughout the next century. It is thus no exaggeration to\nsay that the world has never before witnessed as historic\na juncture as this, where it needs a joint international\nvision and concerted international action with a view to\ncrossing to the shore of safety for which we all yearn.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I\nwish first to convey to Mr. Didier Opertti the warm,\n\nsincere congratulations of the Government and the\ndelegation of Gabon on his well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. This is a tribute to his country, Uruguay, and an\nunambiguous recognition of his personal and professional\nqualities. Our congratulations go also to all the other\nAssembly officers, and we wish them every success in\nguiding our work. We assure them of the support and\ncooperation of the delegation of Gabon.\nTo the President of the General Assembly at the fifty-\nsecond session, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, who spared no\neffort in carrying out his responsibilities, I convey our\nsatisfaction and our deep gratitude.\nThe present times are characterized by political\ntension, by change and by socio-economic upheaval\nexacerbated by a grave financial crisis; our involvement is\nrequired, in more than one respect. Gabon remains\nconvinced that the United Nations continues to be the best\nforum for working together to harmonize our different\napproaches towards peace and development. We owe it to\nourselves to consider the circumstances in which the\nOrganization was established to free the world from the\nspectre of war. Was it just to prevent world war, or was it\nto make use of the renewed humanism inspired by the San\nFrancisco Conference to eradicate all the causes of armed\nconflict wherever they might emerge so as, in the words of\nthe Charter, \u201cto promote social progress and better\nstandards of life in larger freedom\u201d?\nNow more than in the past, and especially since the\nend of the cold war, narrow nationalism has been\nresurfacing to nullify all the international community?s\nefforts to make of our world a global village in which\npeace and security, friendship among nations and\ninternational cooperation are the watchwords. Peace is a\nsine qua non for the development of peoples and of nations.\nThat truth is easy enough to affirm, but applying it is\ncomplicated by the play of interests within States, often\ncombined with outside interference.\nThis has been and remains the bitter experience of\nAfrica. For nearly a decade, the African continent has faced\nmultifaceted political tension and violence between and\nwithin States, just when the end of the cold war had given\nrise to hope that resources would be mobilized for its\ndevelopment.\nYet during that same period many African countries\nhave courageously embarked on political reform and\neconomic restructuring. Overall, there has been tangible\nprogress. Clearly, stability is indispensable for such\nprogress, which means that questions of international\npeace and security are the concern of the day on our\ncontinent, and more specifically in Central Africa. That\nsubregion, so rich in potential, has come since the end of\nthe cold war to be a world disrupted by \u201cthe disorder of\nnations\u201d, fuelled and maintained by a variety of forces.\nAlthough living in peace within its borders and with\nits neighbours, Gabon is extremely concerned at this\nsituation. President Bongo believes that our country\ncannot remain an isle of peace, freedom and even relative\nprosperity in an ocean of misery, violence and fratricidal\nwars. That concern is shared by the other heads of State\nof Central Africa, and was at the root of the summit\nconference held on Thursday, 24 September 1998, at\nLibreville, at the initiative of President Bongo, on the\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That\nimportant meeting gave heads of State and heads of\ndelegation an opportunity to express their support for\nPresident Kabila and to condemn the aggression against\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\ninterference in the internal affairs of that country. They\ncalled for the withdrawal of foreign forces of aggression;\nfor a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\nfor respect for the territorial integrity of that country; and\nfor continuing the process of democratization begun by\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nThey also stressed the need for concerted action by\nthe countries of Central Africa, the States members of the\nSouthern African Development Community, of the\nOrganization of African Unity and of the United Nations,\nand all those who are working to find a solution to the\nCongo crisis, renouncing any partisan decisions that could\nprolong the suffering of the peoples of Congo and of\nneighbouring States. The heads of State and heads of\ndelegation of Central Africa therefore decided to establish\na summit follow-up and negotiating committee under the\nchairmanship of the President of the Gabonese Republic,\nand reaffirmed that it would be appropriate to establish a\nregional peacekeeping force.\nTurning to Angola, I wish first to honour the\nmemory of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Matre Alioune Blondin Beye, and of members\nof his team, who worked tirelessly for peace in that\ncountry, tragically giving their lives to that cause. The\nheads of State and of delegation reaffirmed at the\nLibreville summit their support for the Government of\nAngola, which is sparing no effort in the search for\n25\n\n\nlasting peace in that country and for the full and speedy\nimplementation of the Lusaka accords.\nFinally, with regard to the Republic of the Congo, the\nheads of State supported the reconstruction and national\nreconciliation efforts and condemned the destabilization\nmanoeuvres originating outside the country.\nOf course, we are not insensitive to the disturbances\nand violence occurring in other parts of the world \u2014 quite\nthe contrary. Gabon shares the position of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) on ways and means of resolving\nthe problems in Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and\nSomalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We are\nfollowing most attentively the resumption of dialogue\nbetween the Israelis and Palestinians, as seen in the recent\nsummit meetings. These talks offer a glimmer of hope for\na global settlement of the problems of the Middle East. We\nlikewise believe that only political means will return peace\nto Afghanistan. With the same conviction, we encourage the\nefforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) to preserve peace in South-East Asia.\nA global vision of peace is certainly necessary. In fact,\nthrough the phenomenon of globalization, the shock wave\nof conflict is often felt very far from the epicentre. It is\nequally clear that development cannot be ensured in an\nunstable environment, for peace constitutes the fertile\nground in which development must take root and prosper.\nIt is in that spirit that Gabon studied the remarkable\nreport (A/52/871) that the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, submitted to the Security Council on the causes of\nconflict in Africa. He very rightly noted that historical\nlegacies, internal and external factors, economic motives\nand particular situations are the source of many conflicts in\nAfrica. These various causes are known to us and we must\ncombat them.\nIn this respect, I would like to draw the attention of\nthe Assembly particularly to one of the causes of conflict\nthat I believe should be given our full attention because of\nthe many dangers it poses to the stability of our entire\ncontinent. Furthermore, this phenomenon is also evident in\nCentral and Eastern Europe. I refer to the question of\ntransnational populations \u2014 in other words, communities\ndispersed over several States as a result of various historical\ncircumstances. Aware of the danger in Africa, the founding\nfathers of the OAU, in their great wisdom, inscribed in its\nCharter the principle of the inviolability of frontiers\ninherited from colonization. To reshape States on the basis\nof diverse claims seemed to them to be simply risky. They\ntherefore chose to take charge of our history through the\nopenness of integration. Gabon reaffirms its support for\nthis approach.\nAll in all, the resurgence of nationalism, poor\nunderstanding and abuse of the rights of peoples as well\nas their manipulation, inevitably lead to national unrest,\nwith its attendant deadly difficulties. Faced with these\nrealities and possibilities, the Government of Gabon\nwould more than ever like to reaffirm its commitment to\ncertain principles which underlie the maintenance of\npeace and security, both internally and internationally.\nThese include respect for human rights in general and for\nthe rights of national minorities in particular; respect for\ncultural identities; respect for the territorial integrity of\nStates; respect for national sovereignty; the principle of\nnon-interference in internal affairs; the principle of good\nneighbourliness; and the principle of the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes.\nIn any event, dialogue remains the best and most\neffective way of preventing conflicts and maintaining or\nrestoring peace. Political differences must have a political\nresponse. The African populations, already overwhelmed\nby underdevelopment, cannot and should not have to\nendure, in addition, the deadly consequences of conflict.\nWe must therefore always engage in dialogue. This is\nwhy President Bongo, sensing the changes in history and\nthe aspirations of his people, set in motion in mid-1989\nthe rethinking within the former single party in our\ncountry that led to the national conference of March-April\n1990, which reopened the way to pluralism and\ndemocracy.\nNew regulatory and control institutions have\ngradually been established since then and they are\nworking. Individual and collective freedoms are\nrecognized and enjoyed by our citizens, who can even\nappeal as high as the Constitutional Court, as a glance at\nour newspapers in Gabon suffices to make clear. This\nshows how deeply committed we are to the principles of\nparticipatory democracy, taking into account our overall\nlevel of development and our sociological environment.\nIt is also in this new context that in two months we\nshall be organizing presidential elections for the second\ntime. The logistical and legislative preparations are\nalready at a very advanced stage; they are basically the\nwork of government. The National Electoral Commission,\nwhich is already in place, will conduct the actual electoral\noperations. Its representatives were appointed last week in\nall departments and communes. The Prime Minister sent\n26\n\n\ninvitations a month ago to various States and organizations,\nincluding the United Nations, to observe both the\npreparations and the polling process itself.\nA few days ago I had the opportunity to address the\nSecurity Council on mechanisms for conflict prevention in\nour subregion. Without repeating the report that has been\nmade to the Assembly, I would like to recall here that, in\naccordance with the decision made by the heads of State or\nGovernment of the countries of Central Africa, Defence and\nInterior Ministers of the countries members of the United\nNations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa, meeting in Libreville from 28\nto 30 April 1998, re-examined the plan for the\nestablishment of an early-warning mechanism as an\ninstrument for the prevention of crises and conflicts. Gabon,\nwhich now holds the chairmanship of the Committee, is\ndoing everything in its power to meet the logistics needs to\nallow Libreville to be the headquarters of that mechanism.\nAlong the same lines, also concerning the logic of\nprevention, the Committee held from 18 to 21 May 1998 in\nBata, Equatorial Guinea, the first conference on the\nquestion of relationships between democratic institutions\nand peace in Central Africa. That conference brought\ntogether members of Governments, representatives of\nopposition political parties, high-ranking officials of the\nforces of law and order, representatives of civil society and\nexperts on matters of political freedoms, the press and\nhuman rights. The participants? main recommendation was\nthe establishment of a subregional parliament of Central\nAfrica, which would be charged with dealing with questions\nof common interest, with a view to strengthening measures\nfor confidence-building and subregional peace, while\nserving as a forum for harmonization of views and the\npromotion of values related to the democratic experiences\nof member States. In general, we can say that the action of\nthe Committee is a needed extension of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity?s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution.\nAll these preventive measures would be in vain if the\ninternational community made no further disarmament\nefforts. My country supports the high priority given by the\nUnited Nations to the question of disarmament in general\nand to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction in particular. Even if the harm\nthey can cause is less, we are also concerned about the\nproliferation of conventional weapons, which are also tools\nof death and destruction. We therefore commend the\nstatement by the President of the Security Council on the\noccasion of the ministerial meeting on Africa held on 24\nSeptember 1998, in which the Council asked the ad hoc\nWorking Group to elaborate further concrete\nrecommendations on the need to stem illicit arms flows to\nand in Africa.\nApart from these concerns, we have certain grounds\nfor satisfaction. Disarmament took a step forward very\nrecently with the adoption of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, which I personally signed on behalf of\nGabon on 4 December 1997 in Ottawa, and which has\njust entered into force with the deposit of the fortieth\ninstrument of ratification by an African country, Burkina\nFaso.\nOther significant instruments, such as the Chemical\nWeapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, have become a reality. Gabon,\nconvinced of the prominent role of disarmament in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, is a\nsignatory of these important instruments. My country\ninvites all States Members of the United Nations to work\ntowards complete and general disarmament in the twenty-\nfirst century, the guarantor of a lasting peace. We must\nmake the quest for peace a cardinal point of reference.\nHowever, that peace will remain in jeopardy as long\nas the basic needs of peoples are not met. The persistence\nof conflicts, non-respect for the human person, hatred and\nthe rejection of democratic values all have serious\nrepercussions on the economic health of States. Likewise,\nthe phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons,\nepidemics and the cost of reconstruction in the wake of\nwar all are burdens that affect already fragile economies\nand aggravate difficult social situations.\nThe situation at this end of century makes it\nimperative for the international community to deal with\ndevelopment and social issues if we wish to prevent our\nworld from self-destructing. The content of the 1998\nHuman Development Report, published by the United\nNations Development Programme a few weeks ago,\nstrengthens this conviction. The conclusions of the 1995\nCopenhagen summit therefore remain valid, and the\nUnited Nations must again take the initiative.\nStatements of intention no longer suffice. We need\nconcrete action and realistic programmes that take into\naccount the phenomenon of globalization. These\n27\n\n\nprogrammes must ensure that no one is excluded and that\neach of our nations, by making the necessary efforts to\nadapt, can become integrated in the most harmonious way\npossible. That is why Gabon believes it necessary to\nrelaunch the idea of a new partnership based on fairness in\norder to respond to the legitimate aspirations of people \u2014\nmainly, to eliminate poverty and to promote well-being.\nWith globalization, States? autonomy and room for\nmanoeuvre has been greatly reduced. The power of\nGovernments is offset by the power of the markets.\nOpenness and freedom, however, must not come to mean\nfree rein to establish the law of the jungle, in which we, the\nsmall and the weak, will inevitably be crushed and\ndestroyed.\nIn this context, it seemed necessary to the Government\nof Gabon not to abdicate but to refocus the role of the\nState. A new direction has been reflected, inter alia,\nthrough an ambitious programme of liberalization of\neconomic activities on the one hand and on the other by the\nprivatization of large sectoral public enterprises.\nAs for the structure of the economy of Gabon, let me\nsay that our country remains dependent on the sale of three\nprincipal raw materials: oil, wood and manganese. The\nprices of these products have been on the decline for\nseveral months now. If we factor in the fluctuations in the\nUnited States dollar, which is also on the decline, we can\nsee that the result is a decrease in the income of the State,\nwhich puts the country?s investment and development\ncapacities in considerable jeopardy.\nThis fact is not the only handicap to my country?s\ndevelopment. The debt and its servicing absorb almost 45\nper cent of our budgetary resources. This is truly\nintolerable.\nAll of this notwithstanding, the international financial\ninstitutions continue to classify Gabon as an upper middle-\nincome country, thus preventing its access to financing on\nflexible terms. Gabon is the only sub-Saharan African\ncountry in this situation, which is simply unjust.\nGabon, a developing country just like any other, asks\nthat international financial institutions apply new assessment\ncriteria and, above all, that they give more appropriate\nconsideration to our debt burden in order further to unleash\nour productive capabilities. This would benefit not only the\npeople of Gabon but also our partners abroad.\nOther major problems must also mobilize the\ninternational community, inter alia, the drug problem,\nterrorism, major pandemics, human rights and the\nenvironment.\nThe General Assembly held its twentieth special\nsession on the fight against drugs last June. Gabon is\npleased that on that occasion our Organization enshrined\nthe criminal nature of the traffic in drugs and broadened\nthe options for solutions to this scourge at the global\nlevel. That session gave political impetus to the\ninternational efforts of States in the fight against drug\ntrafficking, which now spares no country. The\nGovernment of Gabon invites the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies to further support the efforts made in\nthis respect at the regional level.\nAs for the scourge of terrorism, and bearing in mind\nthe horrible attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, I must\nfirst of all pay a tribute of compassion and respect to the\nmemory of the Kenyan, Tanzanian and American citizens\nwho lost their lives there. I express my deepest sympathy\nto all of those persons who were wounded. Above all, the\nGovernment of Gabon most forcefully reaffirms its\ncondemnation of acts of terrorism in all their\nmanifestations, wherever they may occur. We believe that\nno cause can justify resorting to such acts. But I also\ndenounce certain retaliatory measures that they inspire, in\nparticular the placing of countries that are suspected of\ninvolvement under embargo. This type of response is\nneither appropriate nor efficient. In most cases, those\ntypes of measures affect mainly innocent civilian\npopulations.\nWe believe, therefore, that under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, urgent dialogue must be undertaken to\nexplore ways and means of preventing and combating\nterrorism.\nIn the field of human rights, Gabon welcomes the\ncreation of an International Criminal Court, as established\nby the Statute adopted at Rome on 17 July last. The same\napplies to the Organization of African Unity Protocol,\nwhich created, at the organization?s thirty-fourth summit,\na Pan-African Court of Justice.\nBecause of industrial development, environmental\nquestions have become an increasingly pressing concern\nfor the international community. The awareness to which\nthe Rio Summit gave rise unfortunately was not followed\nup by the concrete measures that were expected.\nCommitments have not been fulfilled, and as time goes\n28\n\n\nby, the Rio consensus must lead us more than ever towards\na necessary commitment if we wish to avoid its remaining\na dead letter.\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\nmy delegation?s satisfaction with, and its support for, the\nefforts made by the International Seabed Authority, the\nguarantor of a common heritage of humankind, in the\nconsideration of a draft code on the mining, exploration and\nexploitation of the seabed.\nWe must make sincere and tireless efforts on all of\nthese major issues. I very much appreciate the work of our\nOrganization, which, through its executing bodies, its\nspecialized agencies and with the support of other\norganizations, is making every effort to achieve these noble\nobjectives.\nAs I already said last year, Gabon supports the idea\nthat the United Nations system needs rational and consistent\nrenewal, in keeping with today?s realities. The proposals of\nthe Secretary-General on the reform of the budgetary,\nadministrative, social and economic sectors reflect a spirit\nof innovation that will make it possible to face the\nchallenges of the new millennium.\nMore specifically, as regards the thorny question of\nthe expansion of the Security Council, Gabon is, of course,\nin favour of it. We believe Africa should have two\npermanent seats \u2014 I repeat, two permanent seats \u2014 which\nwould be occupied on a rotational basis by all African\ncountries \u2014 I repeat, all African countries \u2014 in accordance\nwith modalities to be determined by them.\nBefore concluding, allow me to commend the\nachievements of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We know\nhis task is immense and difficult. He has already\naccomplished a great deal, with courage and skill. I have\nalready mentioned the promising views he shared with the\nSecurity Council on the eradication of conflicts and the\npromotion of lasting peace in Africa. For Africa, and for\nthe entire international community, we must encourage and\nsupport him.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first extend my sincere\ncongratulations to the new President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session, His Excellency\nMr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nUruguay. I am confident that his diplomatic experience will\nplay an important role in the work of the Assembly. At the\nsame time, I would like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Y.\nUdovenko of Ukraine for the skilful manner in which he\npresided over the work of the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI welcome the opportunity to address the General\nAssembly on behalf of a nation that has emerged more vital\nthan ever before from one of the worst regional crises since\nthe Second World War. The free and sovereign Croatia of\ntoday harbours a vibrant market place of ideas, innovative\neconomic and rich social and cultural practices. We are\nlearning that democracy means the right to both rational\nand what at times might appear irrational choices. We are\nlearning that the free-market economy is both a prospect for\nsuccess and a risk of failure.\nPositive results are already visible. Croatia of today,\nalthough still burdened by the multiple tasks of transition,\nreconstruction, the return of refugees and displaced\npersons and reconciliation, stands firmly rooted in the\nmaturing Central European polity and economy. Croatia\nlooks with ambition and sharpened senses towards\nreclaiming its place in the old Europe and contributing to\nthe new Europe and the global community.\nSince ancient times Croatia has been a European\ncountry. Integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions remains\nour strategic goal. Therefore, Croatia will continue to\nmarch towards it, being devoted to its high standards and\ncommitted to its principles. This year Croatia is presiding\nover the Central European initiative with a great sense of\nresponsibility. Furthermore, Croatia hopes to join the\nWorld Trade Organization soon.\nAs a Central European and Mediterranean country,\nCroatia will further endeavour to remain a key agent of\nstability and peace in this part of the world. Through its\nresponsible policy towards the crisis which has marked\nthe recent history of this part of Europe, Croatia has\naffirmed its indispensable role in the most important\npolitical developments in this region.\nEven though the war is behind us, Croatia is still\ngrappling with the legacies of aggression, such as the\nproblems of devastated economic infrastructure, missing\npersons, ongoing assistance to war victims and invalids\nand the return of displaced persons and refugees. This\nmeans that my country is undergoing a double transition\nat the same time. The transition from war to peace is\nequally complex and demanding.\nIn June this year, the national Programme for the\nReturn and Accommodation of Displaced Persons,\nRefugees and Exiled Persons was adopted, and, as\neverybody agrees, it is being successfully implemented.\nSo far, more than 45,000 Croatian Serbs have returned.\nCroatian authorities are also taking numerous steps and\nmeasures to encourage the process of reconciliation. A\nsuccessful donors\u2019 conference on reconstruction, to be\nheld later this fall, should further contribute to the\nongoing process of return and normalization of daily life,\nespecially in the war-affected areas.\nCroatia is increasingly focusing on post-war\nreconstruction, economic growth and development, as\nwell as on the overall normalization of relations with its\nneighbours to the east and south. But it must be stressed\nthat full normalization of relations with neighbouring\n34\n\n\ncountries has always been a cornerstone of our policies\nfrom the very outset.\nCroatia was not only the first country to recognize\nBosnia and Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign\ncountry, but it has also helped Bosnia and Herzegovina\nmore than any other party in its struggle to survive within\nits internationally recognized borders. Hence, let me repeat\nthat for the Republic of Croatia as a guarantor of the\nDayton Peace Agreement, the following basic principles\nremain paramount: first, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\nsingle, internationally recognized State; second, the\ndecentralization of State apparatus; and third, full equality\nof the three constituent peoples. Croatia cannot support any\nsolution for Bosnia and Herzegovina that does not fully\nincorporate these founding principles or that in any way\namounts to a revision of the Dayton principles. Deviations\nfrom or tacit abrogation of these principles can be both\ndamaging and destabilizing not only to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina itself, but also to the other countries in the\nregion.\nCroatia firmly believes that the recent elections in\nBosnia and Herzegovina will further contribute to lasting\nstability and security. The agreement on free transit through\nthe territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at Neum and use\nof the Croatian port of Ploce, which will be formally signed\nshortly, is yet another example of good-neighbourly\nrelations between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nCroatia has signed an agreement on the State to State\nCouncil on Cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nCroatia supports the efforts by the Office of the High\nRepresentative, United Nations representatives and the\npeacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and shall\nspare no effort in doing what is in its power to help them\nfulfil their mandate.\nWe have come a long way in our bilateral relations\nwith our eastern neighbour, the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia. Since the end of hostilities, 10 bilateral\nagreements have been signed. We hope that the last\noutstanding issue, concerning the security arrangement for\nthe Prevlaka area, will be negotiated promptly. Negotiations\nformally began on 15 September 1998. Croatia stands ready\nnot only to open the border crossings with the Republic of\nMontenegro, but also to continue with demilitarization on\nour side of the border and with the present security regime\ncurrently administered by United Nations Mission of\nObservers in Prevlaka (UNMOP). Whether it is through\nsuccessful bilateral negotiations with the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia, through the Security Council or even\nthrough unilateral action consistent with the rights and\nduties of Croatia under international law, the UNMOP\nmandate should terminate by 15 January 1999, because in\nthe present circumstances another prolongation of the\nmandate can be misused to stall negotiations indefinitely.\nThe other United Nations mission in the Republic of\nCroatia, the United Nations Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL),\nwith a mandate in the Croatian Danubian region, is\napproaching its final stage, after having successfully\ncompleted its task in that part of Croatia and, together\nwith recently adopted measures by the Croatian\nGovernment, having helped create conditions for\nreconciliation and a comprehensive return process.\nTermination of both United Nations missions will be\na new landmark in the life of our country and will\nconfirm once again its sovereignty and integrity over its\nentire territory.\nWhile it has lent its full support and cooperation to\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia, Croatia is not satisfied with its results thus\nfar. Indictments issued so far do not adequately reflect the\nscope of war crimes committed by different sides in the\nconflict nor the level of involvement. The Republic of\nCroatia helped to persuade 11 Bosnian Croats to\nvoluntarily surrender to The Hague Tribunal. Three of\nthem have been acquitted while the rest have been\nawaiting trial for over 12 months, much longer than usual\nin any individual State. On top of that, not a single\nperson \u2014 despite promises made as far back as the\nDayton negotiations \u2014 has been charged for crimes\ncommitted against Bosnian Croats. Furthermore, only one\nSerb was brought to The Hague for crimes committed\nduring the aggression against Croatia, but he died in\nprison and was never sentenced.\nThe most notorious perpetrators of war crimes and\ncrimes against humanity \u2014 Karadzic, Mladic and\nMartic \u2014 still remain at large, and in many cases in full\nview of the international community.\nThe Republic of Croatia shares the concern of the\ninternational community on the rapidly worsening\nsituation in Kosovo and the impending threat to\ninternational peace and security. As a neighbouring\ncountry of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Croatia is\nvitally interested in a speedy resolution of the crisis. We\njoin the international community in condemning violations\nof human rights in Kosovo, and we denounce all forms of\nterrorism, regardless of whether they are committed by a\nState, a group or an individual, bearing in mind that State\n35\n\n\nterrorism represents the most dangerous form of terrorism,\ndue to the resources available to States. Croatia supports a\npeaceful and negotiated solution that would respect both the\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nand the rights of Kosovo Albanians to autonomy. Croatia\nis alarmed at the imminent humanitarian catastrophe, which\nneeds urgent and determined international action.\nThe twentieth century can boast of tremendous\nachievements in various fields on the individual as well as\nthe collective level, while awareness of global\ninterdependence in every respect is growing.\nHowever, we must face the fact that we are also\nwitnesses to the negative legacies of the twentieth century:\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; terrorism;\nnarcotics production, trafficking and consumption; lagging\ndevelopment; disregard for the environment; the rise of\ntransnational crime; and continued grave breaches of\nfundamental human rights and humanitarian law.\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations\npeacekeeping and the adoption of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, let us ask ourselves: what is the United\nNations, what does it really do? I agree with those who\nstrongly believe that the United Nations is not only a global\nOrganization in which Governments exchange views,\nmuster support for their policies and views or trade in votes\nand influence. The United Nations is much more than an\nOrganization; it is a living idea for a better world.\nValues do matter.\nLike all organizations, the United Nations has aged,\nand its structure and mechanisms have become anywhere\nfrom slightly to grossly obsolete. To meet the challenges\nand needs of the emerging global society at the turn of the\ncentury, the United Nations must evolve just as quickly or\nrisk being overtaken by other institutions or initiatives that\nmay or may not be universal in scope, and may or may not\nmore faithfully reflect the credo of a better world for all of\nus. It is high time that we again acted as \u201cWe the peoples\u201d.\nIt is Croatia\u2019s view that the reform of the United\nNations should take many forms and focus not only on the\nneeds of the Organization \u2014 that is, on the fulfilment of its\nlegislative mandates \u2014 but also on increasing its\neffectiveness on the global stage. The Secretary-General has\ndone his part, and it is now up to each and every one of\nus \u2014 as nations, as peoples, as individuals \u2014 to partake in\nreforming the United Nations for the next millennium.\nThe reform of the Security Council remains\nimperative. While the founding principle of the sovereign\nequality of States must be strictly maintained, both the\nstructure and operation of the Security Council must be\nharmonized with the new realities in international affairs.\nInterdependence, liberalization of polities and markets and\nthe profoundly widened access to instantaneous\ncommunication all demand that the function and use of\nthe veto power be readjusted, and that this pivotal world\nbody operate in a more transparent, representative and\notherwise democratic structure. Croatia thus supports the\nenlargement of the Security Council in both categories,\npermanent and non-permanent, fully in line with its\nrepeatedly declared positions.\nSeveral important world conferences have been held\nunder United Nations auspices in the past decade; the\ntime has come to implement the findings and evaluate the\nresults of those conferences.\nWe firmly believe that the role of the Economic and\nSocial Council remains important to the well-being of this\nOrganization and its Members. Although Croatia has\nincreased its presence in United Nations expert bodies,\nincluding two commissions of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, we can do and wish to do more. Hence, Croatia\nattaches paramount importance to its candidature for the\nEconomic and Social Council for the years 2000-2002.\nThe need for further improvement of international\nsecurity structures and mechanisms deserves our special\nattention. If it has been identified with anything, the\nUnited Nations has been widely identified with its\npeacekeeping role. Nowadays, as we approach the end of\nthe active and, by general estimation, highly successful\nUnited Nations peacekeeping presence in Croatia, the\nCroatian Government and people feel very strongly that\nthe time has come for Croatia to pay back in kind some\nof the good deeds bestowed on us by the United Nations\ncommunity. It was with a sense of pride and\nresponsibility that I submitted a letter to the SecretaryGeneral earlier today, formally notifying him of Croatia\u2019s\nreadiness to join the ranks of peacekeeping contributor\ncountries.\nDisarmament and international security issues are\ncritically important in our efforts to preserve peace and\nenhance stability in the increasingly volatile world.\nCroatia is particularly concerned about the problem\nof landmines. We still suffer from the consequences of\nmore than 2 million mines scattered all over our country\nduring the imposed war. A lot of work has been done to\n36\n\n\nalleviate the problem, but many areas have not yet been\ncleared. This situation adversely affects the process of\nreturn of displaced people and refugees and slows down\neconomic reconstruction and development. The sheer\nmagnitude of this problem requires a more forceful and\nresourceful global response, be it financial or technical.\nCroatia ratified the Ottawa Convention in May 1998 and\nstrongly supports the efforts in the Conference on\nDisarmament to start negotiations on a global ban by\nbuilding on the achievements of the Ottawa process.\nThe developments in disarmament, non-proliferation\nand international security since our last session can be a\ncause of great concern. International terrorism is another\nthreat to security and peace in the world. Croatia joins\nothers in unequivocally condemning all forms of terrorism,\nregardless of their motives or origin. Croatia also supports\nthe strengthening of international cooperation in order to\nbring those responsible to justice and prevent further\nabhorrent acts of violence. My Government has ratified all\nmajor anti-terrorist treaties and actively participates in the\ncurrent work on a nuclear terrorism convention.\nCroatia joins the rest of the world in commemorating\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. In the past 50 years it has become obvious\nthat we should all work hard to establish efficient\nmechanisms for the protection of human rights. More\nobjective criteria must be developed for their evaluation in\norder to avoid politicization and establish a universal\nstandard in human rights.\nIn November 1997, Croatia ratified the European\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms, and accepted the competence of the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights and the European\nCommission of Human Rights to deal with individual cases.\nCroatia has also ratified the Framework Convention for the\nProtection of National Minorities and the European Charter\nfor Regional or Minority Languages.\nCroatia welcomes the results of the Rome Conference\non the establishment of an International Criminal Court, and\nthanks the host country, Italy, for its generous hospitality.\nAlthough not all aspirations could be fully accommodated\nin Rome, the establishment of an efficient, permanent\nInternational Criminal Court will be a milestone in the\nmarch towards the universal protection of human rights and\nthe rule of law. Croatia intends to sign and ratify the\nStatute of the court in the near future and calls on other\nStates to do the same.\nThe role of the United Nations remains of vital\nimportance for the world today. Under its auspices, many\npraiseworthy achievements have been made in various\nfields. The United Nations has played an important role\nin Croatia, in time of war as well as now, when its two\nmissions are about to complete their mandates. The\nUnited Nations presence in Croatia will continue at a\nlevel of partnership in addressing social and, especially,\ndevelopment questions. Only a strong and reformed\nOrganization will be able to adequately meet the\nincreasing and changing needs of its Member States.\nIn conclusion, therefore,I would like to say again\nthat values do matter. We the peoples are capable of truly\nreforming the United Nations. We both need and deserve\na United Nations that is able and equipped to meet the\nchallenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that I speak today, before this\nesteemed forum for international dialogue, on behalf of my\ncountry, the Republic of Paraguay. First of all, I would like\nto congratulate the President of the General Assembly and\nto extend to him my best wishes for success in the\nimportant task of guiding the work of the fifty-third session\nof the General Assembly of this Organization.\nI also have the pleasure to greet the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, and to extend to him, on behalf of the\npeople of Paraguay, our congratulations on his excellent\nfulfilment of his important mission.\nAs the century comes to an end, so does a decade that\nhas been for the world, and particularly for nations such as\nmine, a period of far-reaching and vertiginous\ntransformation.\nIn 1989, after almost four decades of authoritarian\nrule, Paraguay regained its democracy. Since that time, a\ngreat number of profound and dramatic changes have taken\nplace in the process of reaffirming our democracy, a\nprocess that today, I am pleased to announce, may now be\nconsidered definitively consolidated, since for the first time\nin 50 years a civilian President has transferred the\npresidency of the Republic to another democratically\nelected civilian. This is an essential milestone in the\nrecent history of our freedom and a striking testimony to\nthe Paraguayan people\u00e2s firm and irreversible commitment\nto this system of government.\nWe took over the administration of a country with\nmajor economic, social and moral problems, but, faithful\nto the people\u00e2s mandate, we will make the decisions that\nwe deem appropriate and fitting to reactivate our\neconomy, restore international confidence in Paraguay\nand, finally, ensure the sustainable and equitable\ndevelopment of its people.\nThis, today, is my commitment, and I will dedicate\nall my devotion and labour to it, though I am aware that\nthis effort would be in vain without the understanding,\nsolidarity and support of my people, as well as the\ninvolvement and cooperation of friendly countries.\nIn this regard, my Government has pledged to carry\nout a State agenda that is pragmatic and realistic. Its\npriorities will include restoration of the people\u00e2s faith in\ntheir leaders through transparent, coordinated actions\nwhose immediate effects will, in the short term, result in\ngreater well-being for the population. We will also carry\nout an all-out war against poverty by doing away with the\nprivileges that engender injustices and intolerable\ninequalities.\nAnother priority will be a rapid economic recovery\nthrough the implementation of social programmes and the\nconstruction of an infrastructure of all-weather roads,\nwhich will expedite and reduce the cost of the rapid\ntransport of goods produced in rural areas to trade\ncentres. We will also initiate programmes to provide\ninexpensive housing for a large sector of the population.\nWe will give priority to the fight against crime in all\nits forms, focusing on the elimination of the scourges of\ndrug-trafficking and the piracy and illegal appropriation\nof intellectual property. The concrete actions we have\ntaken during our first month in office have clearly shown\nour firmness, determination and commitment in this\nregard.\nAnother priority will be combating impunity, one of\nthe ills that eats away at our society. We will be\nassiduous in the rigorous application of the law, which is\nthe inevitable framework for ensuring confidence and\ndevelopment, particularly against those who profit from\nState resources, depriving the rest of the community of\ntheir legitimate chance to aspire to a better standard of\n7\n\n\nliving. Exemplary measures will be adopted to address\npremeditated crimes in the economic and financial sphere.\nWe trust that these measures, along with those for the\nprotection of private property and an adequate framework\nof incentives and security for foreign investment, will assist\nus in recovering Paraguay\u00e2s international credibility and\nwill bring in the flow of cooperation and investment\nnecessary for our desired development.\nThe reform of the principal organs of the United\nNations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is of the greatest importance to us.\nWe have participated in the work of the Working\nGroup on Security Council reform, and once again I wish\nto emphasize the importance we attach to the expansion of\nthe Council in both of its categories; if the number of\npermanent members is increased, the number of non-\npermanent members must be increased as well.\nThis increase must include Latin America and the\nCaribbean and the other regional groups, without any\ndiscrimination.\nWe believe that the effort undertaken by the United\nNations with regard to item 155 on the Assembly\u00e2s\nagenda \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measures to eliminate international\nterrorism\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is of the greatest relevance.\nParaguay vehemently condemns and rejects such acts\nof international terrorism as the attacks on the American\nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\nIn this respect, we wish to express our conviction that\nany international action to prevent and subdue terrorism\nmust be carried out in full and complete compliance with\ninternational law.\nAnother scourge, generally related to terrorism, is that\nof drug-trafficking, to which I have already referred. In this\ncontext, I must add that we are convinced that this is a\nproblem of shared responsibilities among all countries\ninvolved, producing, transit and consuming countries. Our\nposition on this point was clearly stated in the Declaration\nof the Twelfth Meeting of Heads of State and Government\nof the Rio Group, held in Panama City.\nWe welcome initiatives such as resolution 49/96, on\nhorizontal economic cooperation and other modalities for\ncooperation among developing countries. We must also\nmention last year\u00e2s Declaration and Plan of Action of San\nJos\u00c3\u00a9, Costa Rica, which defines specific modalities for\ndealing with sectoral problems relating to cooperation in\nthe spheres of trade, investment, finance and business.\nHowever, we feel that the United Nations system\nshould identify mechanisms, such as economic and\ntechnical cooperation, that will enable it to strengthen\nintegration more effectively, and adopt decisions aimed at\nproviding increased assistance. In this regard, my country\nwill support such measures as will, in a more effective\nand coordinated manner, interest all participants \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nparticularly private-sector participants \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in the\ndevelopment process.\nWe also endorse strengthening the United Nations to\nincrease efficiency within the institutions of the\nOrganization.\nIf our Government programmes focus on supporting\ndevelopment with social justice we can give our peoples\ndemocracy, freedom and respect for human rights.\nHowever, we cannot ask our peoples to fight for\ndevelopment, to make greater sacrifices, if they do not see\nsimilar trends towards change and a unified commitment\non the part of the international community.\nComplying with our commitments made at the\nSummit for Social Development, Paraguay intends to\nachieve the goals set there. In this regard, I am pleased to\nstate that the priorities of our Administration include the\nsocial development of the country; reduction of the\nunemployment rate; the eradication of poverty;\npreservation of the environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a commitment to our\nfuture generations; heeding the demands of our youth; and\nsupporting the advancement of women and of integrated\nsocieties.\nBased on the fundamental principle of universality,\nthe Republic of Paraguay feels that the United Nations\nsystem must welcome, without exception, all States that\nmeet the requirements of the San Francisco Charter.\nGiven this, and bearing in mind the elements that make\nup a State as well as other essential considerations,\nParaguay feels that the proposed participation of the\nRepublic of China in the United Nations and all its\nrelated bodies must be considered. This is what we would\ndo with any other State that met the requirements of the\nCharter.\n\n\n\nI would now like to refer to one of the most important\nstrategies for the socio-economic development of my\ncountry: its participation in the Southern Cone Common\nMarket (MERCOSUR), which is a fundamental objective of\nour foreign policy. The achievements of MERCOSUR,\nwhich was created in 1991 through the Treaty of Asunci\u00c3\u00b3n,\nas part of the process of integration, are a matter of pride\nfor our four countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and\nParaguay \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as for Bolivia and Chile. These\nachievements have encouraged us to renew our efforts,\ncertain that the political will that has guided us so far will\nlead us to achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves:\nto strengthen and consolidate the Customs Union and to\nmove towards a greater level of integration.\nMoreover, it is encouraging to note that the path we\nchose in 1991 has attracted more and more interest from an\nincreasingly globalized world. In this regard, MERCOSUR\nhas shown its openness to dialogue, in particular with the\nsister countries of Latin America. We are not a closed\ncommunity, but, rather, are open to initiatives that will\npromote economic, political and social cooperation. In this\nspirit, we are giving particular attention to the negotiations\ninitiated to establish a free-trade zone for the hemisphere\nand to the negotiations we intend to hold in the near future\nwith the European Union.\nThe recent crisis in financial markets in South-East\nAsia and Eastern Europe, which have in turn threatened the\nstability of the financial markets of emerging economies,\nare a disturbing feature of today\u00e2s international scene. It\nwas mentioned in the Declaration of the Twelfth Summit of\nthe Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, held\nin Panama City, in which the position of the signatory\ncountries is clearly expressed.\nA great deal of hope has been placed in the work\ncarried out by this Organization. We are on the threshold of\na new millennium; the twenty-first century looms on the\nhorizon, rich with opportunities and challenges. Our\nsocieties are suffering from the crisis of the birth of a new\nera, a new order, because we are not all yet adequately\nprepared to confront it.\nTherefore, our societies demand leadership from the\nUnited Nations. The conclusions, recommendations and\nactions that may come from this Assembly could be of\nfundamental importance for our immediate future.\nThe problems emerging from the increase in\nglobalization and interdependence, as well as the dizzying\nspeed with which changes are taking place in the world,\naffecting all aspects of the human condition, force us\ninexorably to confront the challenge of finding the most\nideal mechanisms for dialogue, understanding and\neffective and united international cooperation. We trust\nthat the United Nations will be capable of meeting this\nchallenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of the Kingdom of Thailand, I\nshould like to extend my warmest congratulations to His\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti upon his unanimous election\nto the presidency of the current session of the General\nAssembly. I wish also to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y.\nUdovenko of Ukraine, for his leadership and his tireless\ndedication to the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him\nduring the past year. With his wisdom and experience, he\nled us successfully through the fifty-second session, which\ntook place against a backdrop of political transition and\neconomic transformation in the world, as well as of the\nreform of this Organization. Allow me also to warmly\nwelcome Ms. Louise Fr\u00e9chette, who has brought creative\nenergy to her new post of Deputy Secretary-General since\nthe beginning of this year.\nAs we gather here to discuss United Nations reform\nand other issues of vital importance to this world body, it\nis imperative for us to be clear about what exactly we are\ntrying to achieve. To my mind, many vital questions beg\nto be answered as the United Nations prepares to meet the\nchallenges of a new millennium.\nOne question that looms large above all others is:\nWhat kind of global community do we wish to see in the\nnext century, and what role can the United Nations play\nin such a community?\nAs Members of the United Nations, what are our\nshared responsibilities, both individually and collectively,\nin working towards a global community that fulfils the\nvision of our founding fathers and reflects today?s\nchanging needs? By what means can we prevent the\ncurrent economic crisis from undermining the vast\nprogress achieved during the past decade in the social,\neconomic and political areas? In what ways can we\ntransform the challenges emanating from the crisis into\nopportunities to strengthen the fabric of peace, prosperity\nand stability around the world? When will we achieve our\ncommon aspiration to a world in which democracy is\ncherished, human rights are respected, sustainable\ndevelopment is practised, economic freedom is exercised,\nand people are given the opportunity to realize their full\npotential?\nI do not pretend to have the answers to all these\nquestions, but I am convinced that, together, we can assist\none another in addressing these crucial issues.\nThe United Nations should be exactly what its name\nimplies: a community of nations united in a common\nvision and common purpose. For in this age of\nglobalization, our destinies are truly intertwined and\ninterdependent. One has to look no further than the\neconomic crisis to realize how necessary it is for us to\nthink and act as a global community possessed of a sense\nof shared responsibility.\nFor, indeed, the United Nations can only be what we\nmake of it. The United Nations can only be an effective\nand efficient instrument for peace and prosperity to the\nextent that we, the Members of the United Nations,\ndemonstrate the will, the resolve and the commitment to\nmove the reform process forward.\nI therefore wish to take this opportunity to commend\nthe Secretary-General for having so promptly responded\nto the calls by the Member States to reform the\n24\n\n\nmanagerial structure and working methods of the Secretariat\nand to strengthen cooperation among various United\nNations agencies. Now that the Secretary-General has done\nwhat we have called upon him to do, we, the Members\nStates, must do our part to reform the intergovernmental\nstructure and processes of the United Nations, and we must\ndo so expeditiously.\nWhat is plain is that the reforms will not be of any\nmeaningful consequence if we fail to deliver on our\nsupport, politically and financially. It certainly serves no\npurpose to talk about an enhanced role of the United\nNations if we fail in our responsibility to provide the\nUnited Nations with the means and resources to carry out\nits mission. For its part, Thailand has done its best to meet\nits obligations despite the financial difficulties we are going\nthrough. That is the least we can do to show our steadfast\nsupport for the United Nations and the causes it represents.\nBut the reforms are not an end in themselves. They\nare the means by which we can make the United Nations\nrelevant to the demands of the changing times. No one can\npredict what new challenges the twenty-first century may\nbring. Only one thing is certain, such challenges will be\nmore complex, more multifaceted and more demanding than\never before. At the same time, many current issues promise\nto play an increasingly significant role in the international\narena. These include globalization, human rights,\ndisarmament and illicit drugs. Allow me to touch briefly on\neach of these issues.\nThe biggest and most complex challenge of our time\nis globalization, which has emerged as an elemental force\nof nature, not yet well understood but with the power to\nbuild and the power to destroy. In the early part of this\ndecade, we saw mainly the positive side of globalization \u2014\nmore open markets, greater material well-being, more\nchoice and more convenient dissemination of ideas and\ninformation. As the end of a decade draws nearer, we are\nalso seeing that globalization is not without cost.\nEconomies are succumbing to volatility beyond their\nborders. Seemingly isolated crises can send shock waves\nrippling through the international system.\nOver the past year, Thailand and a growing number of\ncountries have been penalized by the global financial\nmarkets. We recognize that domestic institutional\nshortcomings were partly to blame for the mismanagement\nof the economy. Reforms are therefore being undertaken in\nmany of the affected economies, but they will likely take\nmany years to bear fruit. At this point it seems clear that\nthe severity of the crisis has been all out of proportion to\nthe severity of our mistakes. The crisis is no longer an\nAsian crisis, but a global crisis and a systemic crisis.\nThe industrialized countries, insofar as they stand to\ngain the most from globalization and lose the most from\na worldwide retreat from it, have an obligation to help\ncontain the spreading contagion. The perception that this\nwill stop at a certain point \u2014 at Thailand, at Indonesia,\nat South Korea \u2014 has time and again been proven wrong.\nNow, with the world teetering on the brink of global\nrecession, the G-7, by acting to check the financial crisis,\nwill not be performing an act of global charity but one of\nself-preservation.\nThe destabilizing potential of unfettered global\nfinancial flows, as demonstrated by the Asian crisis,\npoints to a glaring gap in our global economic\narchitecture. I wish to add my voice to the growing calls\nfor the international community \u2014 developing nations in\nconjunction with developed nations \u2014 to come up with\na mechanism or framework entrusted with the global\nmonitoring and regulation of international financial flows.\nThe United Nations should propose a world conference on\nthe world financial system to be held in the very near\nfuture. The proposal by the Committee for Development\nPlanning (CDP) of the United Nations for the creation of\nsuch a body or mechanism also merits serious\nconsideration.\nWhile such a mechanism is being worked out, we\nmust pay greater attention to the human and social costs\nof the crisis. To cushion the impact, the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialogue\npartners will be discussing how to promote human\nwelfare and development within the framework of the\nASEAN Post-ministerial Conference caucus on social\nsafety nets proposed by Thailand.\nIn this age where ideas can be carried far and wide\nby the currents of global media, such concepts as\ndemocracy, human rights and sustainable development\nhave stirred the imagination of peoples in developing\nnations everywhere. My delegation would like to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for strengthening the\nwork of the United Nations on human rights, particularly\nin bringing Geneva and New York together and\nappointing Mary Robinson as the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Her grace, her\nexperiences, her devotion and her competency will\ncontribute to the protection and promotion of human\nrights worldwide.\n25\n\n\nln today?s global village, human rights have become\nnot a luxury but a necessity. Advancing the cause of human\nrights makes sense not only from a philosophical\nstandpoint, but also from a pragmatic standpoint. Obstacles\nto and violations of human rights lead to the displacement\nof populations across borders, with a host of attendant\nsocial and economic problems, posing an immense burden\non countries of first refuge, receiving third countries, and\nthe international community as a whole.\nThe primary responsibility for observing human rights\nnecessarily rests with the State. Respect for human rights\nand civil liberties must begin at home. But progress can be\nslow. Democratization is by definition driven by each\ncountry?s own internal dynamics.\nIn South-East Asia the economic crisis has given\nmomentum to the struggle for democracy and human rights.\nGovernments are being challenged to reconcile rising public\nexpectations and demands with pre-existing norms and\ninstitutional structures. It may well be that democracy and\nhuman rights will gain ground as a result, but there is also\na lurking danger that Governments will respond harshly and\nreverse any progress made.\nIn Cambodia, for example, a fragile democracy is\ntaking root, but the outcome is far from certain. Continuing\nfactionalism threatens to unravel the peace and stability\nwhich took so many years to build. As a neighbour,\nThailand cannot but be concerned that should this latest\nattempt at democracy fail, mission fatigue might set in.\nAfter spending so much time, energy and money on\nCambodia, it is not unreasonable for the international\ncommunity to expect some compromise among the political\nleadership, if only for the sake of the country?s long-\nsuffering people. It would be unfortunate indeed if the\ninternational community were to give up on Cambodia and\nturn its attention elsewhere. But Thailand recognizes as well\nas any country that building democracy is not an overnight\nprocess.\nThailand does not advocate human rights promotion\nmerely because it is fashionable to do so. Human rights and\ndemocracy in Thailand were won the hard way \u2014 paid for\nwith blood, sweat and tears. Something that comes at so\nhigh a price cannot but command great value.\nThailand therefore fully supports the United Nations\ninitiative to strengthen its human rights mechanisms and\nbelieves that the global community should step up\ninternational and regional cooperation to uphold and\npromote fundamental human rights.\nFor Thailand?s part, the advancement of human\nrights and democracy has become an integral part of our\nnational development policy. The most recent\nmanifestation of this effort is our new Constitution,\nadopted in 1997. I am proud to say that this\nConstitution \u2014 the most democratic in Thai history \u2014\naccords human rights in Thailand their most prominent\nposition to date and embodies practically all the important\nelements of the international instruments on human rights.\nThailand also gives high priority to the advancement\nof women and the protection of children?s rights, in\nkeeping with its obligations and commitments under the\nframework of the international instruments, plans and\nprogrammes of action. Moreover, as part of the\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, apart from the organization\nof a series of seminars, Thailand is making plans to\naccede to the International Covenant on Economic, Social\nand Cultural Rights.\nOver the past decade, humanity has made great\nstrides towards global peace, but we have yet to fully\nreap its dividends. Despite the end of the cold war,\nnations continue to place greater value on armaments than\non meeting the basic needs of their people. One statistic\nI saw in this year?s Human Development Report was at\nonce startling and disheartening. It indicated that just last\nyear the nations of the world spent a total of $6 billion on\nbasic education for their people, $9 billion dollars on\nwater and sanitation, $13 billion on basic health and\nnutrition, and a staggering $780 billion on military\nexpenditures.\nOf the potentially most devastating threats to\nhumanity, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction remains particularly worrisome. Thailand is\nfully committed to the multilateral effort towards\ndisarmament. We welcome the establishment of the\nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs, under the leadership\nof Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala, as part\nof the Secretary-General?s reform measures approved by\nthe General Assembly last year. We will also continue to\nsupport, financially and materially, the activities of the\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and\nDisarmament in Asia and the Pacific, in spite of financial\ndifficulties at home.\nEven as we continue our efforts to dismantle and\neliminate weapons of mass destruction, we must continue\nto work towards reducing the conditions that would\nprompt their use in the first place. Confidence-building\n26\n\n\nthrough closer dialogue and interaction must be a core\ncomponent of any effort to build lasting peace.\nFor nuclear weapons, the task of disarmament cannot\nbe left to only the nuclear Powers. The global community\nmust also bring pressure to bear to emphasize that nuclear\narms have no place in confidence-building efforts. Thailand\nthus joined with nine other South-East Asian nations in\nsigning the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\nTreaty, which has already come into force. We are hopeful\nthat the nuclear-weapon States will support our endeavours\nin this regard by acceding to the Protocol of that Treaty.\nThailand also hopes for South-East Asia and the world\nto be free of anti-personnel landmines. Multilateral attempts\nto address the problem should not be confined merely to\nthe banning and destruction of landmines. The international\ncommunity must also tackle other equally important related\nissues, including the provision of financial and technical\nassistance on demining to mine-affected countries as well\nas humanitarian assistance to victims of landmines. My\ndelegation has learned with great pleasure of the rapid\nprocess of ratification by signatory States, which would\nresult in the Ottawa Convention entering into force less\nthan six months from now. As a signatory State, Thailand\nlooks forward to ratifying the Convention in the near future.\nA more insidious but no less destructive threat to\nhumanity is the scourge of narcotics. We all know the\ncorrosive effects that drugs have on the fabric of society,\nthe lives and dreams they shatter on a daily basis. Yet for\nall our efforts, the problem has never been completely\neradicated.\nMy Government has therefore made the fight against\nnarcotics a high national priority. On the occasion of the\ntwentieth special session of the General Assembly in June,\nThailand joined with other signatory countries of the 1993\nmemorandum of understanding on drug control to issue a\njoint Declaration reaffirming our strong determination to\nfight the narcotics problem. The following month, in July\n1998, Thailand and its fellow ASEAN members issued a\njoint declaration stating our intention to achieve a drug-free\nASEAN by the year 2020.\nThailand?s success in opium-supply reduction is a\nmatter of record. But effective drug control also requires\ndemand reduction, towards which the Thai Government is\nalso undertaking various national measures. Accordingly,\nwe welcome the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of\nDrug Demand Reduction adopted at the special session\nearlier this year.\nAs food for thought, I would like to reiterate my\ndelegation?s view that, for the next decade, international\ndrug-control efforts should focus on the problem of\namphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) as well as on ways\nand means to prevent the diversion of precursors used for\nillicit drug production. This idea was recently agreed upon\nby members of the Non-Aligned Movement at the summit\nin South Africa. We urge all States to cooperate in\neliminating the supply of ATS and precursors, the illicit\nmarket for which is now much larger than that for drugs\nderived from narcotic crops, the natural sources.\nAs we approach the new century, it is becoming\nclear that we are also entering a new epoch in human\nhistory, unlike any that has gone before. As the forces of\ntechnology, globalization and complex interdependence\nexert ever greater influence on international relations, the\ncoming epoch will be one of great peril but also of great\npromise.\nThe past year has shown us that our\naccomplishments rest on fragile foundations. The world\nnow faces a crossroads. One path offers the choice of\nworking harder to forge ever stronger international\ncooperation, spurred on by the prospect of continued\npeace and prosperity. Or we can choose the other path\nand remain apathetic and complacent, lulled by a sense of\nour own infallibility.\nThe choice is clear enough. But the challenge will be\nto translate all the good intentions into effective action.\nMuch uncertainty exists in the way international financial\nmarkets work, in the appropriate measures and strategies\nthe international community will need to evolve in\nresponse to new economic and political challenges, and,\nof course, in the age-old problems of war and peace.\nThe United Nations, as always, will have a central\nrole to play in resolving the differences among nations\nand regions, in ensuring the promotion of international\ncodes of conduct and norms, in strengthening preventive\ndiplomacy and peacekeeping, in bridging the gap between\nthe rich and poor nations, in fighting the scourge of\ninternational crime, and in promoting and protecting\nhuman rights.\nThe United Nations alone cannot achieve these\nobjectives. The fulfilment of our common hopes and\naspirations rests not only with the United Nations\nOrganization, but with the united nations of the world. It\nis up to all of us to make the right choices, to make the\ndifference as humanity prepares to enter the new century\nwith resolve and hope for a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me at the\noutset to express great pleasure at seeing you preside over\nthe work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nWe are confident that under your able leadership the work\nof this session will be an unmitigated success. I can assure\nyou of the cooperation and support of my country\u2019s\ndelegation throughout your stewardship of this session.\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to our\nindefatigable Secretary-General and his staff for the efforts\nthey are making, often under very trying conditions, to give\nmeaning and concrete expression to the lofty ideals\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. They\ndeserve the full support and cooperation of all Member\nStates and their peoples.\nAs we approach the next millennium, we are fully\nconscious of the omnipresence of war and of the havoc it\ncontinues to wreak upon peoples in literally every\ncontinent of the world. It is true that local wars have so\nfar not posed a serious threat to international peace and\nsecurity, but by some accounts they have already killed\nand maimed more people than both world wars combined.\nAnd judging by the number of those who are killed in\nthem and other attendant consequences, these wars,\nwhatever their cause, are a living reality for those who\nfight in them and for the innocent people who are caught\nin the cross-fire. The conclusion we can draw is that not\nall succeeding generations of humankind have been\nspared the scourge of war in accordance with the promise\nmade over 50 years ago by the founding fathers of this\nOrganization. In terms of human history, 50 years is a\nrelatively short time. It is, however, long enough to make\nthe judgement that present-day human beings, like their\npredecessors in history, have failed to unlearn the ways of\nwar \u2014 or rather to acquire the skills to live with one\nanother like good neighbours.\nThe presence of war and conflict among and within\nnations has often drawn a great deal of criticism to the\nUnited Nations, as if it had a magic wand to resolve\nevery problem brought to its doorstep. True, there is room\nfor improvement in the performance and efficacy of the\nUnited Nations. Certainly, the genocide in Rwanda in\n1994 could have been avoided with more determination\nand foresight.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in awarding themselves certain\nextraordinary powers, the framers of the Charter built\ncertain imperfections into the Organization which have\nproven to be serious encumbrances to its efficiency and\neffectiveness on conflict resolution. So long as this\nOrganization remains the creation of the nation-State\nsystem with its in-built self-interest, it cannot be expected\nto perform differently. But we can certainly improve its\ndelivery system to acceptable levels. Notwithstanding the\nimperfections of the United Nations, its continued existence\nis in the national interest of all Member States, whatever\ntheir claims to the contrary. Otherwise, Member States\nwhich felt they benefitted the least would long since have\nwithdrawn their membership. Member States should\ntherefore commit themselves to the payment of their\ncontributions to the budget of the United Nations when they\nfall due, without any conditions.\nIdeally, the United Nations should have developed\nmachinery to address and avert conflict situations before\nthey actually occur. However, in the world in which we\nlive, the ideal and the real do not often dovetail. Preventive\ndiplomacy should quickly be succeeded by robust\npeacekeeping as soon as it is determined that a conflict\nsituation is not amenable to resolution through dialogue.\nPreventive deployment has been put to use successfully in\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the\nseparation of belligerent forces has also been put to\nsuccessful use to contain the otherwise explosive situations\nin Cyprus and Lebanon.\nThe African experience in peacekeeping has been\nslightly different. In most cases, conflicts have smouldered\nand festered to calamitous proportions on our continent as\na result of international inertia \u2014 or should we call it\n\u201cAfrica fatigue\u201d? Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Great Lakes\nregion and other cases are illustrative in this regard. African\nStates are ready and willing to bear their fair share of\npeacekeeping operations on the continent, but they are\ncertainly lacking in logistic and financial wherewithal.\nWhile there is ample scope for improvement in African\npeacekeeping capacity, Africa has over the years acquired\npractical experience both in the field and through\ncooperation with other countries. Thus, Africa has a\nrelatively sophisticated capacity to carry out peacekeeping\nresponsibilities.\nI must admit that it hurts my pride as an African to\nhear that African conflict situations dominate the agenda of\nthe Security Council. This is a dubious honour, if indeed it\nis an honour at all. It must, however, be acknowledged that\nAfrican problems are problems of the international\ncommunity. They are problems of the United Nations,\nwhose Charter is categorical in allocating primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. That responsibility was bestowed in trust. It\ncannot be shirked for political expediency in any part of\nthe world. African conflicts deserve equal attention by\nthis Organization, to which all African States belong and\npay their dues, however modest. They cannot be left to\nthe Africans alone to resolve.\nIf I have devoted a great part of my address to the\nrole of the United Nations in crisis management and in\nthe defusing of tensions, it is not because I am oblivious\nto other equally pressing issues of our times. Crises and\ntensions, by their very nature, presuppose a lack of\nsecurity, movement of people and, very often, deep-rooted\nintolerance. Evidently, when people raise swords against\ntheir neighbours, the humanness that is innate in all\npeople is replaced by the bestiality that lies latent in every\nperson. It is incomprehensible how the perpetrators of\nacts of genocide and other serious crimes against\nhumanity manage to live with their consciences or to lead\nnormal lives after such heinous criminal activities.\nThe establishment last summer of the International\nCriminal Court will, we hope, help to ensure that\nperpetrators of acts of genocide, crimes against humanity\nand other inhuman acts will not go unpunished. The\nInternational Criminal Court will also, we hope, act as a\ndeterrent for those intending to commit such serious\ncrimes. The conviction by the Rwanda Tribunal of two\nleading personalities involved in acts of genocide in\nRwanda in 1994 has also served notice to would-be\nperpetrators of similar acts that the international\ncommunity can no longer tolerate their diabolical acts.\nHuman rights abuse is equally intolerable and\nimmoral. Institutions dealing with human rights should be\nempowered to deal with the perpetrators of human rights\nabuses with the full force of the law. Human rights abuse\nhas been responsible for the bulk of the horrendous\nconflicts that have ravaged societies in all continents\nthroughout this violent century. We therefore could not\nagree more with the Secretary-General when he says in\nhis annual report on the work of the Organization,\n\u201cIf individual rights are not protected, the whole of\nsociety suffers. Personal freedoms are however\nrendered largely meaningless by civil wars, or by\neconomic, social or cultural deprivation \u2014 often,\nindeed, by a combination of all these\u201d. (A/53/1,\npara. 171)\n2\n\n\nTherefore, in this, the year of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the\ncommunity of civilized nations to which we all belong must\nreaffirm its commitment to the human rights ideals\nenshrined in the Declaration and to their determination to\nlive up to those ideals.\nGlobalization and economic liberalization have brought\nabout unprecedented expansion in world trade and\ncommerce, but they have also accentuated the imbalances\nin international economic relations. The vast majority of\ncountries, particularly in Africa, continue to face\nmarginalization in the world economy. The problem is\nfurther compounded by the fact that official development\nassistance has fallen to unprecedentedly low levels.\nIn Africa, armed conflicts have impacted negatively on\ndevelopment prospects. Corruption has also been one of the\nbiggest obstacles to development. There is, however, reason\nfor optimism. The majority of African countries have\ninstituted reforms to achieve economic growth and\ndevelopment, including the application of sound\nmacroeconomic policies, good governance, the rule of law\nand respect for human rights. They have taken serious\nmeasures to introduce budgetary reforms, remove\nrestrictions on current payments and restrain credit and\nmonetary expansion. Over the past few years Africa\u2019s\neconomic performance has been on an upward trend. In\n1997 close to 60 per cent of the African countries\nregistered growth rates in excess of their population growth\nrates, and about half of this number posted annual\neconomic growth rates of more than 5 per cent.\nAfrica, however, still needs active support and\nassistance from the international community. We clearly\nrecognize that it is the primary responsibility of the\nAfricans themselves to reduce the marginalization of their\ncontinent from the world economy. But for Africa to\nachieve any tangible success and emerge from the\nconditions of poverty and underdevelopment a new type of\npartnership with the developed world is required to increase\ntrade and the continent\u2019s share of global prosperity. African\ncountries need improved access to world markets, greater\nflow of foreign direct investment, technology transfer and\nan increase in official development assistance.\nThe decline in official development assistance needs\nto be reversed. Similarly, external debt is a problem\nrequiring urgent attention. In fact, the debt burden continues\nto be one of the main obstacles to economic growth and\ndevelopment. The new initiative adopted by the Bretton\nWoods institutions to reduce the multilateral debt of the\nheavily indebted poor countries is a welcome\ndevelopment, though its implementation has been very\ndisappointing and painfully slow. Botswana believes that\nthe only viable solution to the debt problem faced by the\npoorest countries is outright cancellation of the debt.\nThe main objectives of Botswana\u2019s development\nstrategy are employment creation and poverty alleviation.\nLack of income is the most immediate cause of poverty\namong our people. Employment opportunities have\nincreased significantly in the last few years, but the rate\nof unemployment is still unacceptably high. To improve\nthe situation, Botswana has over the past few years\nundertaken measures to create a favourable environment\nfor investment, including the encouragement of small and\nmedium-scale enterprises. I am confident that with the\nsupport of our development partners our efforts will bear\nfruit.\nBefore I conclude my statement, let me say a few\nwords about recent events in southern Africa. On 16\nSeptember 1998 there was an attempt to put an end to the\nconstitutional order in the Kingdom of Lesotho by\noverthrowing a democratically elected Government. Junior\nofficers in the Lesotho Defence Force mutinied and\narrested their senior officers, including the army\ncommander. Government employees, including Cabinet\nMinisters, were stopped from going to work, which\nresulted in a complete collapse of the administrative order\nin the country. Criminal activity and lawlessness became\nthe order of the day. There was no doubt that Lesotho\nwas on the brink of widespread violence and total chaos.\nThe crisis was most alarming because of its wider\nimplications for peace and stability in the whole\nsubregion of southern Africa. No effort was made by\nthose involved to heed the calls for peaceful dialogue.\nUnder the circumstances, the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) could not remain\nindifferent. Therefore, on 21 September 1998 members of\nthe Botswana Defence Force and the South African\nDefence Forces entered the Kingdom of Lesotho in\nresponse to an appeal for such intervention by the\ndemocratically elected Government of Lesotho. The\nintervention is aimed at assisting the people of Lesotho to\ncreate conditions conducive for them to address their\ndifferences in a peaceful manner. Our action conforms\nstrictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of\nthe United Nations, as well as the resolution of the 1997\nHarare summit of the Organization of African Unity\nwhich condemns the overthrow of legitimate Governments\nby the military.\n3\n\n\nI wish to assure the Assembly that the military\nintervention by Botswana and South Africa in Lesotho is\nmotivated solely by a sincere will to establish conditions of\npeace and security in our sister country. We are dealing\nwith a difficult, complex and rapidly changing situation. As\nsuch, our forces shall remain in Lesotho for as long as\nnecessary to restore public order and the rule of law.\nWith regard to Angola, it has become increasingly\nclear that the leader of UNITA has no intention that it shall\nmeet its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Given the\nrenewed upsurge in violence caused by UNITA, SADC has\ncome to the conclusion, regretfully, that Mr. Savimbi must\nbe held personally responsible for war crimes that his\nmovement has committed, and continues to commit even\nafter it has signed a peace agreement. The people of Angola\nhave suffered for far too long and it is time that this\nfratricidal war, which has devastated the country, was\nbrought to an end.\nAcross the border from war-weary Angola, another\nSADC country is going through a painful process of\nnational rebirth, rudely interrupted two months ago by a\nrebellion which, even as we meet here, is ineluctably\nsapping the residual energy of a devastated country. The\npeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve a\nbreak. Through the timely assistance rendered by three\nSADC countries at a time of great peril, it is our fervent\nhope that the Democratic Republic of the Congo will soon\nresume its process of rebirth and do so in peace and\ntranquillity.\nLet me conclude by assuring you, Mr. President, and\nthe nations gathered here that Botswana\u2019s faith in the\nUnited Nations as the universal repository of the hopes and\naspirations of all mankind remains as strong as ever. We\nwill continue to work assiduously for the enhancement of\nthe efficacy of the Organization, to help equip it for the\narduous tasks that lie ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me\ngreat pleasure to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti warmest\ncongratulations on behalf of the Government of the\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly. Trinidad and Tobago is indeed heartened to\nsee one of its regional neighbours in this post, more so\ngiven the close ties of friendship which exist between\nTrinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. I am convinced that\nunder his astute guidance the deliberations of the\nAssembly will be managed with the same skill and\ndiplomacy with which he is known to discharge his duties\nof office.\nI also take this opportunity to express deep\nappreciation for the manner in which his predecessor, Mr.\nUdovenko, undertook the tasks of office during his tenure\nas President of the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly. The impact of his leadership and the\nachievements of the Assembly during the last session of\nthe General Assembly can only redound to the benefit of\nthis body.\nThe United Nations has grappled, over the past 53\nyears of its existence, with myriad issues confronting the\ninternational community \u2014 old issues and new issues,\nespecially those which have taken on a new dynamic in\nthe international relations of our Member States. Having\nsuccessfully manoeuvred through the high seas of the cold\nwar, the United Nations continues to confront issues of\ndirect concern to all its Member States. In striving to\nattain its goals of international peace and security and\njustice for all, which are the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United\nNations, this most valuable Organization to all of the\nworld\u2019s peoples is now drawn to focus on development as\na necessary precondition to the achievement of\ninternational peace and security.\nWe are now called upon to focus attention on the\ndeep-seated problems of the global community. These\ninclude the alleviation of poverty; drug abuse and illicit\n9\n\n\ndrug-trafficking; environmental degradation; economic\ngrowth and social development of developing countries;\nand; more recently, the effects of the international financial\ncrisis. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is of the\nview that these challenges can be successfully addressed\nonly through international cooperation. No individual state\nor region can in isolation rid itself of these problems.\nOne of the principal tenets of international peace and\nsecurity is the rule of international law. For too long,\nblatant disregard for international law has led to heinous\ncrimes which have shocked the conscience of mankind,\nmany of which have remained unpunished. Perpetrators of\ngenocide, of crimes against humanity and of war crimes\nhave acted with impunity, causing untold human suffering\nand loss of life on a massive scale.\nEach life lost, each soul affected, each family, society\nor country touched by tragedy is one too many. The\ninternational community has not, until now, established a\npermanent mechanism to punish the perpetrators of these\nunspeakable crimes.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is proud of\nthe role played by Mr. Arthur Robinson, President of the\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago, in refocusing the\nattention of the international community in 1989 on the\nneed for the establishment of a permanent International\nCriminal Court.\nWe congratulate the ever increasing number of States\nwhich have worked assiduously since then to ensure the\nestablishment of a permanent, independent and effective\nInternational Criminal Court. At the same time, we urge all\nStates to continue, in the spirit of cooperation and\ncompromise which ensured the success of the Rome\nConference in July 1998, to complete the work that still\nremains to be done. In this quest, we all must be ever\nmindful of the continued threats to international peace and\nsecurity as well as breaches of international justice, which\nare occurring even as we meet today.\nWhen the President of the Republic of Trinidad and\nTobago urged the international community to create a\npermanent International Criminal Court, it was in part a\nrecognition of the gravity of the scourge of drug trafficking\nand its attendant ills, and of the pressing need for the Court\nto address the question of the punishment of individuals\nresponsible for these crimes at an international level. At the\nDiplomatic Conference held in Rome, Trinidad and Tobago,\nwith the support of Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\nmember States and some other States, was successful in\nensuring that the international community did not lose\nsight of the importance of the inclusion of the crimes of\nthe illicit traffic in narcotic drugs within the jurisdiction\nof the Court. As a result, the Diplomatic Conference\nrecommended that an acceptable definition and the\ninclusion of drug crimes be considered by a review\nconference to be convened after the entry into force of the\nStatute.\nDrug trafficking and the associated crimes of money-\nlaundering and trafficking in arms continue to pose\nserious threats to the social, economic and political\nfoundations of countries of the Caribbean, and to erode\nthe moral fabric of our societies. We welcome the\nconclusions and recommendations of the twentieth special\nsession of the General Assembly on the world drug\nproblem, held in June 1998, and we pledge our\ncommitment to cooperate at the international, regional and\nnational levels in the achievement of the goals and ideals\nwhich we adopted at that session.\nTrinidad and Tobago will persist in its efforts on a\nregional basis to foster the type of cooperation that would\ncombat the scourge of drug trafficking. Such action\nincludes the implementation of the 1994 Barbados\nProgramme of Action, which facilitates effective drug\ncontrol cooperation in the region. Also, CARICOM\ncountries, with the assistance of the Governments of\nCanada, the United Kingdom and the United States, have\ncreated a witness protection programme. In addition, Port\nof Spain is the headquarters of the secretariat of the\nCaribbean Financial Action Task Force on money-\nlaundering.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is\ncooperating at the bilateral level with the three countries\njust mentioned in areas such as extradition and maritime\ncounter-drug operations. We are also the beneficiary of\ntechnical assistance in the strengthening of our Counter\nDrug Crime Task Force to facilitate our efforts in\naddressing this menace to society.\nAction at the national level includes the\nestablishment of an agency to coordinate the overall\nefforts against drug-trafficking and the preparation of a\nmaster plan to deal with the problem. A strong legal\nframework has been put in place to enable prosecutions\nand investigations. Appropriate legislation to facilitate\njudicial cooperation with other countries and participation\nin regional and multilateral institutions has also been\nenacted. Legislation currently before Parliament will\n10\n\n\nsignificantly improve the provisions against money-\nlaundering.\nThe eradication of drug-trafficking, money-laundering,\nand the traffic in arms and their associated evils must be a\ntask for all Member States. The deleterious effects on our\nsmall societies threaten future generations of our peoples\nand have significant negative repercussions on our\nvulnerable economies. The eradication of this affliction of\nour societies is a sine qua non for development and for the\nachievement of international peace, security and justice.\nTrinidad and Tobago shares the sadness, shock and\noutrage of the international community at the recent\nterrorist attacks on United States embassies in Tanzania and\nKenya, as well as at the bombings in South Africa and in\nIreland. This spectre of terrorism continues to rear its ugly\nhead in our world, in spite of the numerous efforts that\nhave been undertaken on a multilateral level to eradicate\nthis evil.\nAt the second informal consultations of the Council\nfor Foreign and Community Relations, held in New York\non 24 September 1998, Caribbean Community Foreign\nMinisters condemned the recent terrorist attacks in several\nparts of the world and reiterated their strongest commitment\nto the fight against international terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. They also pledged that their respective\nGovernments would consider acceding to relevant\ninternational conventions and protocols on international\nterrorism. The Ministers reaffirmed that the most effective\nway to confront international terrorism is through an\nenhanced multilateral approach and multilateral actions, and\nwith appropriate oversight and accountability measures.\nInternational conferences have also attempted to draw\nup a blueprint for addressing the environmental problems\nthat plague the nations of the world. In 1992, at the Earth\nSummit in Rio, the international community for the first\ntime linked environmental and economic issues. The\nBarbados Programme of Action adopted two years later,\nwhich addressed the specific problems of small island\ndeveloping States, complements Agenda 21, the blueprint\nfor sustainable development adopted at Rio. The small\nisland developing States (SIDS) Programme of Action,\nwhich is to be reviewed at a special session of the General\nAssembly next year, is therefore of critical importance to\nsmall island States. We anticipate that the results of the\nreview will be more promising than those of Agenda 21.\nThe pace of globalization and economic liberalization\nhas heightened the economic problems that developing\ncountries face. This is evidenced in, among other things,\nthe collapse of the financial markets, the unfair terms of\ntrade and the developing countries\u2019 increasing difficulty\nin accessing the markets of the developed countries. The\ncrisis presently facing many States and the gathering\ngloom over the world economy pose very real dangers for\ndeveloping countries and therefore call for properly\ndevised strategies and the establishment of new\nmechanisms to ensure our survival.\nRecent developments within the international\neconomic and financial arena are clear indications that the\nworld economic system is crying out for urgent change.\nThe imperfections, which are becoming increasingly\nglaring, can no longer be ignored. We cannot simply bear\nwitness to the events. We must act now or lose a golden\nopportunity to influence the changes which are in the best\ninterest of all humanity. We must have healthy,\nconstructive dialogue at all levels and develop the\npolitical will and direction to find relevant solutions.\nTo this end, I wish to reiterate the call made by the\nhonourable Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and\nTobago, Mr. Ralph Maraj, at the Twelfth Conference of\nHeads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-\nAligned Countries, held last month in Durban, South\nAfrica, for the convening of a United Nations conference\non the world economy. It is evident from the views\nexpressed from this podium during the last two weeks\nthat Member States recognize the need for urgent action\nat the international level to address this issue.\nIn this volatile economic environment, small island\ndeveloping States are rendered even more vulnerable by\ntheir inherent features of size, remoteness, insularity and\nsusceptibility to natural disasters. Indeed, in one fell\nswoop any small advances in economic development can\nbe brought to nought by natural disasters. The devastation\nwreaked by the recent Hurricane Georges on small States\nof the Caribbean bears sad testimony to this reality.\nTrinidad and Tobago shares the grief of its Caribbean\nneighbours at the loss of life and the damage to property\nsuffered in this hurricane. As is the case with other\ndeveloping countries, the needs of small island developing\nStates cannot be addressed without the full support and\ncooperation of the international community. Trinidad and\nTobago continues to make every effort to provide\nassistance to the islands affected by this disaster, in\ncooperation with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency\nResponse Agency, a regional agency established to deal\nwith all types of disasters.\n11\n\n\nTrinidad and Tobago has succeeded to some extent in\nachieving integration into the world economy as it\nundertakes the transition from an oil-dependent, public-\nsector dominated economy to a more diversified market-\noriented private-sector led one. There is still a pressing\nneed, however, for employment-generating growth from\nnon-traditional labour-intensive sectors which will have\nmore pointed impact on the reduction in poverty and\nunemployment levels in our country.\nOur people are hurting. It is imperative therefore that\nthe United Nations programmes for development be\ndirected more specifically towards employment creation\nopportunities for our peoples.\nTrade policy is an important area of concentration of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO). Developing\ncountries, including small island States, are being asked to\ncompete with developed countries while unequal levels of\neconomic development persist \u2014 and to do so in a very\ndifficult economic environment and within unrealistic time-\nframes. Small States must adopt a series of policy changes\nto reorient their economies and diversify their production\nbases. While implementing these measures, they must also\ndevelop their internal capacities to deal simultaneously with\nsuch policy changes. This cannot be achieved in the short\nterm without a high degree of support from the regional\nand international organizations and the international\ncommunity as a whole.\nIt is imperative that we find innovative ways to bridge\nthe gap between the United Nations and private citizens. It\nis in this context that we welcome the establishment of the\nUnited Nations Fund for International Partnerships, which\nwill strengthen partnerships to support the United Nations\nand its projects and deliver resources to programmes and\npeoples served by United Nations agencies. The approval\nof grants for projects in the broad categories of children\u2019s\nhealth, environment and climate change, women and\npopulation, food security, drug control, poverty alleviation\nand landmines will contribute significantly to the pursuit of\nthe goals of the United Nations. The establishment of this\nFund is testimony to what can be achieved by a shared\nvision and commitment to the principles and ideals of the\nOrganization. We urge optimum use of the benefits to be\nderived from the Fund.\nAs we observe the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights this year, Trinidad and\nTobago would like to restate its commitment to the\nprotection and promotion of human rights and the\nfundamental freedoms of its citizens. The Constitution of\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago guarantees human\nrights and freedom to all its citizens, without\ndiscrimination based on race, origin, colour, religion or\nsex. The right to life, liberty, security of the person and\nthe right not to be deprived thereof, except by due\nprocess of law, are guaranteed by the Constitution. Also\nguaranteed are the right not to be subjected to cruel and\nunusual treatment or punishment, the right to a fair trial,\nfreedom of expression and freedom of the press. An\nindependent judiciary is ever vigilant to ensure that these\nrights are not abrogated or infringed.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is fully\ncognizant of its duty to protect the security and well-\nbeing of its citizens, including the innocent, the victims of\nviolence and the vulnerable. Their rights have also been\nguaranteed by the Constitution. We do not subscribe to\nthe current trend that subordinates the rights of these\ncitizens to those of the perpetrators of violent crimes\nagainst them. We are of the view that our innocent\ncitizens also deserve the Government\u2019s protection of their\nbasic rights to life and security of the person.\nWe cannot speak of development without focusing\nspecific attention on the problems of social development,\npoverty eradication and sustainable economic\ndevelopment. The international community must, now\nmore than ever, jointly seek to ensure both the economic\nwell-being and the social development of all its peoples.\nIn this regard, the United Nations has made tremendous\nstrides in its efforts to confront the problems of\ndevelopment and to improve the quality of life of\nhumankind. We are aware that, to this end, a number of\ntools have been devised to enable the international\ncommunity to build a consensus in the social and\neconomic fields.\nIt is of special significance to Trinidad and Tobago\nthat, in accordance with General Assembly resolution\n50/161 of 22 December 1995, a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly will be convened in the year 2000 for\nan overall review and appraisal of the implementation of\nthe outcome of the 1995 World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and to consider further actions and\ninitiatives.\nThe 10 commitments undertaken at the World\nSummit in Copenhagen constitute strong imperatives by\nMember States and the international community to\nachieve social development with the well-being of\nindividuals in the society at the core. One of the\ncommitments given priority attention at the Copenhagen\n12\n\n\nSummit was the eradication of poverty. However, poverty\nlevels remain alarmingly high, and more practical initiatives\ntowards eradicating poverty are essential. We are pleased\nthat the General Assembly has identified this as a priority\nissue and has dedicated the period 1997-2006 as the first\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty in\norder to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty\nand reducing overall poverty substantially in the world.\nThe effect of globalization and its impact on social\ndevelopment must be carefully studied. The United Nations\nand its relevant bodies will be a useful forum for this\ndiscourse.\nTrinidad and Tobago sees these as some of the issues\nwhich the Preparatory Committee for the special session\nshould consider when it convenes its substantive sessions in\nMay 1999 and April 2000 to ensure that the special session\nwill be meaningful.\nIn September 1995, at the Fourth World Conference\non Women, firm commitments were undertaken to improve\nthe status of women by adopting the Beijing Declaration\nand Platform for Action. Follow-up activities are under way\nand should continue apace vigorously to ensure that the\nmandates of the Beijing Conference are fully implemented.\nAn area which requires special focus is the enhancement of\nwomen\u2019s involvement in the development process. We\nwelcome the decision taken by the General Assembly in\nDecember 1997 to convene in the year 2000 a high-level\nplenary review to appraise and assess the progress achieved\nin the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action\nand to consider further action and initiatives.\nTrinidad and Tobago attaches great significance to the\nrights of children. We are committed to ensuring that they\nare neither disadvantaged nor deprived in any fashion of the\nmeans necessary for their wholesome development and their\nfull integration into society. Since the entry into force of\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, Trinidad and\nTobago has taken a number of measures to promote and\npursue the mandates of the Convention. Steps have also\nbeen taken to achieve national awareness in this area,\nincluding the elaboration of a national Plan of Action for\nthe Survival, Protection and Development of Children, the\npromotion of the rights of children through school and\ncommunity outreach programmes and the establishment of\na Child Registry for monitoring children in need of special\nprotection. Measures are also being undertaken with respect\nto the harmonization and codification of all laws relating to\nchildren, as well as the establishment of a Family Court.\nWe are on a swift march towards the new\nmillennium. Let us, as a community of nations, renew our\nresolve to work towards the achievement of the goals we\nhave set for ourselves: goals of peace, security, justice\nand development for all. Political will and commitment\nare necessary for this process, as is a genuine appreciation\nof the realities faced by each individual member of the\ninternational community in the pursuit of these goals.\nWe, the Member States of the United Nations, must\nnot lose sight of the interdependence of development and\nthe attainment of these ideals. As we formulate new\npolicies in our strategy for the improvement of all aspects\nof the lives of humankind, and as we invent new\nmodalities for their implementation, we are encouraged by\nthe many successes we have had, especially in recent\nyears.\nTrinidad and Tobago pledges to continue to work\nassiduously in its efforts to establish the foundations for\na peaceful, secure and just world. This is the only legacy\nwe must leave to future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I take this\nopportunity, as President of the Republic of South Africa\nand as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement, to\nextend to you our sincere congratulations on your election\nto the high post of President of the General Assembly.\nYou will be presiding over this august Assembly of\nthe nations of the world at a time when its deliberations and\ndecisions will be of the greatest consequence to the\ncontinuous striving of humanity at last to achieve global\npeace and prosperity.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement, as well as my own\ncountry, which is a proud member of that Movement,\ninvests great trust in this Organization to discharge its\nresponsibilities to all nations, especially at this critical\nperiod of its existence.\nQuite appropriately, this fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly will be remembered through the ages as\nthe moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftieth\nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the\nNazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration\nheld high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be\nbuilt on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in\neach of its clauses.\nFor those who had to fight for their emancipation,\nthose such as ourselves, who, with United Nations help, had\nto free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights served as the\nvindication of the justice of our cause.\nAt the same time, it constituted a challenge to us\nthat our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to\nthe implementation of the perspectives contained in the\nDeclaration.\nToday we celebrate the fact that this historic\ndocument has survived a turbulent five decades, which\nhave seen some of the most extraordinary developments\nin the evolution of human society.\nThese include the collapse of the colonial system,\nthe passing of a bipolar world, breathtaking advances in\nscience and technology and the achievement of the\ncomplex process of globalization.\nAnd yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who\nare the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent\nconflicts.\nThey have, as yet, not attained their freedom from\nfear of death that would be brought about by the use of\nweapons of mass destruction as well as conventional\narms.\nMany are still unable to exercise the fundamental\nand inalienable democratic rights that would enable them\nto participate in the determination of the destiny of their\ncountries, nations, families and children and to protect\nthemselves from tyranny and dictatorship.\nThe very right to be human is denied every day to\nhundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and\nthe unavailability of basic necessities, such as food, jobs,\nwater and shelter, education, health care and a healthy\nenvironment.\nThe failure to achieve the vision contained in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramatic\nexpression in the contrast between wealth and poverty\nwhich characterizes the divide between the countries of\nthe North and the countries of the South and within\nindividual countries in all hemispheres.\nIt is made especially poignant and challenging by the\nfact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty, the\nperpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-State\nand intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of the\ndemocratic right of many across the world, all result from\nacts of commission and omission, particularly by those\nwho occupy positions of leadership in politics, in the\neconomy, and in other spheres of human activity.\n13\n\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that all these social ills,\nwhich constitute an offence against the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, are not a preordained result\nof the forces of nature or the product of a curse of the\ndeities.\nThey are the consequence of decisions which men and\nwomen take or refuse to take, men and women all of whom\nwill not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for the\nvision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights.\nThis Declaration was proclaimed as universal precisely\nbecause the founders of this Organization and the nations\nof the world that joined hands to fight the scourge of\nfascism, including many that still had to achieve their own\nemancipation, understood clearly that our human world was\nan interdependent whole. Necessarily, the values of\nhappiness, justice, human dignity, peace and prosperity\nhave a universal application, because each people and every\nindividual is entitled to them. Similarly, no people can truly\nsay it is blessed with happiness, peace and prosperity where\nothers, as human as themselves, continue to be afflicted\nwith misery, conflict, terrorism and deprivation.\nThus can we say that the challenge posed by the next\n50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and\nby the next century whose character it must help to fashion,\nconsists in whether humanity, and especially those who will\noccupy positions of leadership, will have the courage to\nensure that at last we build a human world consistent with\nthe provisions of that historic Declaration and other human\nrights instruments that have been adopted since 1948.\nImmediately, a whole range of areas of conflict\nconfronts us, in Africa, Europe and Asia. All of us are\nfamiliar with these, which range from the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola and Sudan on my own\ncontinent, to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan,\nTajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia.\nClearly, this Organization, and especially the Security\nCouncil, acting together with people of goodwill in the\ncountries and areas concerned, has a responsibility to act\ndecisively to contribute to the termination of these\ndestructive conflicts. Continuously, we have to fight to\ndefeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification of\narms, the adulation of force, born of the illusion that justice\ncan be guaranteed by the capacity to kill, or that disputes\nare necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means.\nAs Africans, we are grateful to the Secretary-General\nfor the contribution he has made to help us find the way\ntowards ending violent strife on our continent. We have\ntaken heed of his report, which will reinforce our efforts\nto banish war from our shores. I have not yet read the\nreport from page to page, but I will try to do so.\nThe very first resolution of the General Assembly,\nadopted in January 1946, sought to address the challenge\nof\n\u201cthe elimination from national armaments of atomic\nweapons and of all other major weapons adaptable\nto mass destruction\u201d. (resolution 1 (I), para. 5 (c))\nWe must face the fact that after countless initiatives\nand resolutions, we still do not have concrete and\ngenerally accepted proposals supported by a clear\ncommitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy,\nfinal and total elimination of nuclear weapons and\nnuclear-weapon capabilities.\nWe take this opportunity to salute our sister\nRepublic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urge\nall others that have not yet done so to follow this\nexcellent example.\nIn an honest attempt to contribute to the definition\nof the systematic and progressive steps required to\neliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilation\nwhich they pose, South Africa, together with Brazil,\nEgypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and\nSweden, will be submitting a draft resolution to the First\nCommittee for consideration by the Assembly. It is\nappropriately titled \u201cTowards a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld: the need for a new agenda\u201d.\nI call with all humility on all Members of the United\nNations seriously to consider this important draft\nresolution and to give it their support. We must ask the\nquestion, which might sound naive to those who have\nelaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal\nto eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2014 why do they need them, anyway?\nIn reality, no rational answer can be advanced to\nexplain in a satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the\nconsequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to the\nuse of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of\nsome States over others.\n14\n\n\nUrgent steps are also required to arrive at a just and\npermanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of the\nrealization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of\nPalestine and respect for the independence and security of\nall the States of this important region. We also look\nforward to the resolution of the outstanding issues of\nWestern Sahara and East Timor, convinced that it is\npossible to take these matters off the world agenda on the\nbasis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoples\nconcerned.\nSimilarly, we would like to salute the bold steps taken\nby the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this\nsupremely important country of Africa, to enable it to\nreturn to democratic rule and a system of governance\ndirected at serving the interests of all its people.\nTogether we are also faced with the scourges of drug\nabuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics, organized\ntransnational crime and international terrorism. We strongly\nsupport the measures adopted or being discussed by the\nUnited Nations to deal with these challenges and commit\nour country and Government to cooperate fully in all\nregional and international initiatives to ensure that the\npeoples of the world, including our own, are spared the\ndestructive impact of these crimes.\nThe world is gripped by an economic crisis, which, as\nPresident Clinton said in this city only a week ago, has\nplunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted and\ndisoriented the lives of ordinary people, and brought deep\npersonal disappointment to tens of millions of people\naround the world.\nPresident Clinton also said:\n\u201cRecent press reports have described an entire\ngeneration working its way into the middle class for\nover 25 years, then being plummeted into poverty\nwithin a matter of months. The stories are\nheartbreaking \u2014 doctors and nurses forced to live in\nthe lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class families\nwho owned their own homes, sent their children to\ncollege, travelled abroad, now living by selling their\npossessions.\u201d\nPresident Clinton said that \u201cfast-moving currents\u201d in\nthe world economy\n\u201chave brought or aggravated problems in Russia and\nAsia. They threaten emerging economies from Latin\nAmerica to South Africa\u201d,\nand he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economic\ntheory.\nHe further recognized that with a quarter of the\nworld\u2019s population in declining growth, the United States,\nin Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan\u2019s\nwords,\n\u201c cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.' Growth\nat home depends upon growth abroad\u201d.\nI have quoted the President of the United States at\nsuch length both because he is correct and because he is\nthe leader of the most powerful country in the world.\nAccordingly, we would like to believe that with the\nproblem facing all humanity, and especially the poor,\nhaving thus been recognized, courage will not desert the\npowerful when it comes to determining the correct course\nto be taken, and following this course, addressing the\nchallenge that has been identified.\nThe tragedy President Clinton describes goes far\nbeyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class to\nwhich he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is the\ncondition of the daily existence of even larger numbers of\nordinary working people. Paradoxically, the challenge of\npoverty around the globe has been brought into sharp\nfocus by the destructive fast movements of currents of\nwealth from one part of the world to another.\nPut starkly, we have a situation in which the further\naccumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the\nimprovement of the quality of life of all humanity, is\ngenerating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace.\nThe imperative to act on this urgent, life-and-death\nmatter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge to\nensure that the countries of the South gain access to the\nproductive resources that have accumulated within the\nworld economy should not be avoided by seeking to\napportion as much blame as possible to the poor.\nClearly, all relevant matters will have to be\naddressed, including such issues as greater inflows of\nlong-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation;\ntechnology transfers; human resource development; the\nemancipation of women and the development of the\nyoung; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic; environmental protection; and the strengthening\nof financial and other institutions relevant to sustained\neconomic growth and development.\n15\n\n\nFortunately, it is no longer in dispute that serious work\nwill also have to be done to restructure the multilateral\nfinancial and economic institutions so that they address the\nproblems of the modern world economy and become\nresponsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world.\nSimilarly, this very Organization, including its\nimportant Security Council, must itself go through its own\nprocess of reformation so that it serves the interests of the\npeoples of the world, in keeping with the purposes for\nwhich it was established.\nThe issues we have mentioned were discussed in a\ncomprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conference\nof the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban,\nSouth Africa, earlier this month.\nI am privileged to commend the decisions of that\nimportant meeting to the General Assembly and the United\nNations as a whole, including the Durban Declaration,\nwhich the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain that\nthe decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement will\ngreatly assist this Organization in its work and further\nenhance the contribution of the countries of the South to the\nsolution of the problems that face the nations of the world,\nboth rich and poor.\nThis is probably the last time I will have the honour\nto stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly.\nBorn as the First World War came to a close, and departing\nfrom public life as the world marks half a century of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that\npart of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it\nshould be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and\ntranquillity in the village of my birth.\nAs I sit in Qunu, my village, and grow as ancient as\nits hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has\nemerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region,\non my continent and in the world, which will not allow that\nany should be denied their freedom, as we were; that any\nshould be turned into refugees, as we were; that any should\nbe condemned to go hungry, as we were; that any should\nbe stripped of their human dignity, as we were.\nI will continue to hope that Africa\u2019s renaissance will\nstrike deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the\nchanging seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into a\nrealizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of\nthe aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity.\nThen would history and the billions throughout the world\nproclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we\ntoiled to give life to a workable dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by thanking the\nAssembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by\nnoting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.\nPeace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.\nBosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United\nNations is actively mediating crises before they explode\ninto war, all around the world. And today more people\ndetermine their own destiny than at any previous moment\nin history.\nWe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights with those rights more\nwidely embraced than ever before. On every continent\npeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and\na great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United\nNations.\nStill, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise\nof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil\ntoday threatens to undermine confidence in free markets\nand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from\nthis economy have a special responsibility to do more to\nminimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global\nmarkets to all citizens. And the United States is\ndetermined to do that.\nWe still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious\nand tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many\nStates to acquire such weapons.\nAnd, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not\nfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a\ncontinuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which says\n9\n\n\n\u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of\nperson.\u201d\nHere at the United Nations, at international summits\naround the world and on many occasions in the United\nStates, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in\ndetail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing\nand what we must yet do to combat terror.\nToday I would like to talk to the Assembly about why\nall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of\nour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern\nto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted\nover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi\nArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own\ncitizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public\nbuildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and\nDar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives\nto building bridges between nations \u2014 people very much\nlike all of those present \u2014 died in a campaign of hatred\nagainst the United States.\nBecause we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with\na powerful military and a worldwide presence active in\npromoting peace and security, we are often a target. We\nlove our country for its dedication to political and religious\nfreedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights\nof the individual. But we know that many people see us as\na symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they\nfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots\nelsewhere.\nBut we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we\nbelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continue\nour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us\nto pull back from the world\u2019s trouble spots, to turn our\nbacks on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own\nopposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace\na victory they must never have.\nStill, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as\nonly, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a\nclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and\ninnocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the\npeople represented here, is immune. Certainly not the\npeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American\nkilled there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500\nmore injured \u2014 innocent people going about their business\non a busy morning.\nNot the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where\nthe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants\nalike \u2014 mostly children and women, two of them\npregnant \u2014 people out shopping together when their\nfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the\npast.\nNot the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin\ngas in the Tokyo subway.\nNot the people of Argentina, who died when a car\nbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos\nAires.\nNot the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by\nancient animosities that cry out for resolution.\nNot the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year\nafter year, for all their progress towards peace.\nNot the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of\nunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.\nNot the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second\nPresident to assassination.\nNot the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,\nRussia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where\ninnocent people have been victimized by terror.\nNone of those victims were American. But every\none was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or\nmother \u2014 a human life extinguished by someone else\u2019s\nhatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never\nbe the same.\nTerror has become the world\u2019s problem. Some argue,\nof course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the\nnumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,\nsometimes less than the number of people killed by\nlightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point\nin several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the\n1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater\nopenness and the explosion of information and weapons\ntechnology. The new technologies of terror and their\nincreasing availability, along with the increasing mobility\nof terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to\nchemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing\neach of us into the category of possible victim. This is a\nthreat to all humankind.\nBeyond the physical damage of each attack, there is\nan even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to\nmeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb\n10\n\n\nthreat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;\nthe kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so\nhard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or\nchild is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the\nrest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so\ncrucial to peace and prosperity.\nIn every corner of the world, with the active support\nof United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build\nbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with\ntheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors from\naround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in\nNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday\nAgreement. But that took confidence, confidence that\ncannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure\neach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But\nwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle\nEast, in Asia, in South America \u2014 how many agreements\nhave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many\nbusinesses will never be created in places crying out for\ninvestments of time and money? How many talented young\npeople in countries represented here have turned their backs\non public service? The question is not only how many lives\nhave been lost in each attack, but how many futures were\nlost in their aftermath.\nThere is no justification for killing innocents.\nIdeology, religion and politics, even deprivation and\nrighteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to\nunderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of\ncourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seen\nthat where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate\nact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing\ncame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the\nMiddle East, whenever we get close to another step towards\npeace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this\nstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,\nafter all, a leap of faith \u2014 a break with the past \u2014 and\nthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their\nown hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases\nterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.\nWe must also acknowledge that there are economic\nsources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses\nof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the\nsiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing\nsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor\ncan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents\nis not a social programme.\nNevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does\nnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that\nfoster it. The most recent United Nations Human\nDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is widening\nbetween the world\u2019s haves and have-nots. We must work\nharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into\nthe poison of hatred.\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only\nrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must\nshow people they have everything to gain by embracing\ncooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply\nan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world\u2019s\nresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to\nspread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to\nbuild new, open economies. Developed nations have an\nobligation to help developing nations stay on the path of\nprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week\nago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international\neconomy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens\nwithin them.\nSome believe that terrorism\u2019s principal fault line\ncentres on what they see as an inevitable clash of\ncivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate\nin this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an\ninevitable clash between Western civilization and values\nand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is\nterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any\nreligion to justify whatever political objectives they\nhave \u2014 even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the\nworld believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,\ngrants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding\nof Islam.\nA quarter of the world\u2019s population is Muslim, from\nAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the United\nStates, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.\nThere are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the\nUnited States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The\n6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there\nis no inherent clash between Islam and America.\nAmericans respect and honour Islam.\nAs I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and\naround the world, I see again that we share the same\nhopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to\nprovide for our children, to follow the faith of our\nchoosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and\nto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.\nOf course, we are not identical. There are important\ndifferences that cross race and culture and religion which\ndemand understanding and deserve respect. But every\n11\n\n\nriver has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in\nAmerica, like the United Nations, to reconcile all\nAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in our\nincreasing diversity, we will remain on a course of\nfriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will\ncontinue to look for common values, common interests and\ncommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit\nexpressed by these words of Mohammed: \u201cRewards for\nprayers by people assembled together are twice those for\nprayers said at home.\u201d\nWhen it comes to terrorism, there should be no\ndividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and\nCatholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and\nemerging countries. The only dividing line is between those\nwho practise, support or tolerate terror and those who\nunderstand that it is murder, plain and simple.\nIf terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and\nshould be at the top of the world\u2019s agenda, what, then, are\nthe concrete steps we can take together to protect our\ncommon destiny? What are our common obligations? At\nleast, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,\nno sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on\nStates that do; to act together to step up extradition and\nprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger\ndomestic laws and control the manufacture and export of\nexplosives; to raise international standards for airport\nsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence and\ndespair.\nWe are working to do our part. Our intelligence and\nlaw enforcement communities are tracking terrorist\nnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of\nthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our\nembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I\nwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to\nrepair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the\nworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in\nKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.\nBut no matter how much each of us does alone, our\nprogress will be limited without our common efforts.\nWe will also do our part to address the sources of\ndespair and alienation through the Agency for International\nDevelopment in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in\nEastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue\nour strong support for the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Bank and the World\nFood Programme. We also recognize the critical role\nthese agencies play and the importance of all countries,\nincluding the United States, in paying their fair share.\nIn closing, let me urge all of us to think in new\nterms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or\npolitical action by other means, or a divine calling, but as\na clash between the forces of the past and the forces of\nthe future, between those who tear down and those who\nbuild up, between hope and fear, between chaos and\ncommunity.\nThe fight will not be easy. But every nation will be\nstrengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning\nto the words of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important\nthat we do this together.\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the\nUniversal Declaration. She said, in one of her many\nspeeches in support of the United Nations when it was\njust beginning,\n\u201cAll agreements and all peace are built on\nconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot\nget on with other people in the world unless you\nhave confidence in them.\u201d\nIt is not necessary that we solve all the world\u2019s\nproblems to have confidence in one another. It is not\nnecessary that we agree on all the world\u2019s issues to have\nconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary that\nwe understand every single difference among us to have\nconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that we\naffirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together\nwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a\nthrowback to yesterday, and together, together we can\nmeet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears\nwith confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I wish him success in his future\nendeavours.\nHere we come again to this universal forum, to meet,\ndiscuss and debate questions that concern our nations and\npeoples. This has become more necessary and pressing than\never before. The world in which we live today, and in\nwhich, God willing, future generations will live, has grown\nsmaller in terms of geography and time, but to our great\nregret its problems and crises are still as great and as\ncomplicated as ever. They have even become greater and\nmore complicated as a result of their interconnectedness\nand interrelated nature and the interactions among their\nramifications and effects.\nWe cannot but wonder, while sitting here within the\nframework of this universal, international organization,\nabout the events and developments that occurred in our\nworld during the past year and about those emerging\nquestions and crises that call for our utmost attention. Have\nwe managed to take steps towards the better world we seek\nfor our countries and peoples? Have we succeeded in\nsettling any of the bloody conflicts or in pacifying any\nregion fraught with tension and any of the chronic hotbeds\nof tension in the network of regional and international\nrelations? Has democracy flourished and have human rights\nbeen consolidated? Have we dealt with the problem of\nterrorism and succeeded in eliminating its causes and\nmanifestations? How far have we gone in our efforts to\ncombat the devastating scourge of drugs? And to what\nextent have we achieved the aspirations to put an end to\npoverty, misery and unemployment; to find humanitarian\nsolutions to the phenomenon of migration and the mass\nflow of refugees; to eliminate international organized\ncrime syndicates; to prevent the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction in general, and nuclear weapons in\nparticular; to halt the arms race; and to devote more\nresources and energy to programmes of development,\neducation and welfare? These are major questions\nconcerning urgent issues and problems that call for our\nutmost attention and efforts in order to attain these long-\nawaited solutions and remedies.\nDuring the past months, we have all followed the\ndevelopments of the economic and monetary crises that\nhave engulfed the States of South-East Asia and the Far\nEast. We have seen how these developments have led\nthese States to stagnation, inflation and social suffering\nafter they had been models of prosperity and rapid growth\nfor the world.\nAlso, we are still following with grave concern the\neconomic and financial upheaval experienced by the\nRussian Federation, to whose new Government I would\nlike on this occasion to wish success in its efforts to cope\nwith this turmoil and to extricate the country from the\ndifficulties it is facing.\nNaturally, we are concerned at the prospect of the\nextension of the adverse consequences of these turbulent\neconomic conditions to other States and regions of the\nworld that have been relatively free from them so far.\nThis brings us to the repercussions of all of this on the\neconomies of our States in the Gulf region and the\nMiddle East, especially in the light of the drop in the\nworld oil prices and the decline of the revenue earned\nfrom this vital commodity on which the producing and\nexporting States are primarily dependent to implement\ntheir programmes and attain their development\naspirations.\nIf these developments prove one thing, it is the\nextent to which organic interdependence and interrelation\nhave come to characterize the economies of the world,\ncontrol its markets and define the constantly fluid relation\nbetween its producers and its consumers. This, in turn,\nprompts us to deal with these monetary and economic\nconditions from a global, open perspective free from\nisolationism and narrow-mindedness. It is also incumbent\nupon us to make the necessary efforts to cope with the\npresent crisis on the basis of international partnership,\nsocial justice and developmental and monetary balance,\nand to prevent it from worsening and becoming, God\nforbid, a worldwide economic recession. If this were to\nhappen, it would have extremely adverse political, social\n28\n\n\nand economic effects with unpredictable consequences for\nus all.\nWe speak about global concerns and questions, but\nregional crises and conditions have not been any better\nduring recent months. The peace to which we have aspired\nin our region is still, to our great regret, an elusive mirage.\nIt is indeed very distressing, even enraging, for one to see\nthat several years of negotiations, endeavours and mediation\nhave failed, so far, to bring the peace process in the Middle\nEast to its desired objective: the achievement of a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the\nprinciples of international legitimacy, on the resolutions of\nthis world Organization which is hosting our current debate,\nand on the basis of security, stability and mutual\nrecognition among all nations and peoples of the region.\nIt is also regrettable that the peace process has not\nexperienced any positive development since the coming into\noffice of the present Government in Israel; rather, it has\nsuffered a serious setback. At a certain time there were\nhopes and expectations that the Middle East was on the\nverge of a genuine peace allowing everyone to live in\nsafety and tranquillity, and to enjoy equal rights. The hope\nwas that the wars that had set the region ablaze and had\nbled it for so long would come to an end, to be superseded\nby a process of development, cooperation and prosperity.\nIn the light of those hopes, a series of economic\nconferences related to the peace process was launched, the\nlast of which was the Al-Doha Conference, after which\nthese conferences came to a halt. This is indeed a reflection\nof the situation which the peace efforts reached and the\ndifficulties that have faced and are still facing these efforts.\nThe essential problem facing the peace process, in our\nview, is the fact that Israel, under its current Prime Minister\nand its hard-line Government, has reneged, and is still\nreneging, on the principles which originally formed the\nbasis for the peace process, and on the accords concluded\nin the framework of that process between the former Israeli\nGovernment and its Arab neighbours.\nHere, I would like to remind the Israeli Government\nthat the peace process was based on the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973), regarding the need for withdrawal\nfrom the Arab territories occupied in 1967, and resolution\n425 (1978) regarding southern Lebanon and the Lebanese\nBekaa. This process was also based on the principle of land\nfor peace and the attainment by the Palestinian people of\ntheir legitimate rights. We view all of these principles as\ninternational obligations, which Israel, as a State Member\nof the United Nations, must honour and abide by.\nIn this regard, allow me to depart from the text of\nmy statement to say how fervently I wish that Prime\nMinister Netanyahu had been sincere in his statement\nyesterday, when he claimed he was as interested in\nproviding security and peace for Palestinian children as he\nwas for his own children. However, the bitter reality with\nwhich we are all familiar says otherwise. Since\nMr. Netanyahu took office, his Government has been\npursuing a policy contrary to the objectives and the spirit\nof the peace process in the region. His failure to\nimplement the accords signed with the Palestinian side\nhas worsened the suffering of all segments of the\nPalestinian people, including the Palestinian children who\nsuffer harsh living conditions where they lack the\nminimum basic requirements of life in education, health\nand nutrition. I wish Mr. Netanyahu had informed us of\nthe future awaiting these children, who are chafing under\nthe effect of the economic embargo imposed on them by\nhis own Government.\nIn this context, I have to underline the tragic\nconditions of the Palestinian people under occupation and\nthe daily arbitrary practices they suffer at the hands of the\nIsraeli forces, as if they had not suffered enough from\n1948 until the present day. Here, I would like to single\nout in particular settlement activity, the confiscation of\nland, the demolition of houses and the driving of whole\nfamilies out of their homes. All of this should strengthen\nour resolve to intensify efforts towards achieving a just\nsolution that would restore to the Palestinian people their\nlegitimate rights, including their right to establish their\nindependent State, with holy Al-Quds as its capital, and\nsecure the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied\nArab territories in the Syrian Golan, south Lebanon and\nthe Lebanese Bekaa in conformity with United Nations\nresolutions and the principles of international legitimacy.\nThis would make it possible to speak of genuine peace in\nthe region on a just, comprehensive basis and on the basis\nof mutual respect and security for all.\nI would also like to indicate that the decision by the\nIsraeli Government on 21 June 1998 to expand the\nmunicipal limits of the city of Jerusalem, which would\nalter the legal status of the Holy City, is a direct\ncontravention of the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly. Moreover, such a step\ncontradicts the accords concluded between the Israelis and\nthe Palestinians and violates the basis of the peace\nprocess which provides for deferring the question of\n29\n\n\nAl-Quds so that it would be agreed upon in the permanent\nstatus negotiations. Therefore, we express our support for\nthe presidential statement issued by the Security Council on\n13 July 1998 in response to the Israeli action. The Council\ncalled upon Israel to refrain from executing its plans and\nfrom taking any action that would prejudice the outcome of\nsuch negotiations or pre-empt the accords that they may\nresult in. The statement also calls upon Israel to comply\nscrupulously with its legal obligations and responsibilities\nunder the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of\nCivilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.\nI would also like to place on record our satisfaction\nwith the result of the voting at the 89th meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly?s fifty-second session, on 7 July 1998,\nwhich resulted in granting Palestine, in its capacity as\nobserver in this international body, additional rights and\nprivileges of participation in the sessions and work of the\nAssembly. We view this step as a simple rehabilitation and\na modest step towards endorsing the membership of\nPalestine and its legitimate position in the framework of the\nUnited Nations and its institutions, in the hope that the day\nwill come when, God willing, we will see the Palestine\ndelegation representing a State admitted as a full-fledged,\nactive member in this universal, international organization\nin the near future.\nThe consolidation of peace and security, the\nenhancement of the principles of mutual confidence and\ngood neighbourliness, the peaceful settlement of all\nconflicts and disputes through dialogue and peaceful means,\nand commitment to the principles of international law are\nthe foundations of the policy of my country, Qatar, vis-\u00e0-\nvis our neighbours. That is why we consider the question\nof security and peace in the Gulf region and the Middle\nEast a vital question of the highest priority for us and for\nour brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council. From this\nperspective, we call for the settlement of the dispute\nbetween our sister State, the United Arab Emirates, and the\nfriendly Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands of Abu\nMusa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb through bilateral\ndiplomatic efforts or, if need be, by resorting to\ninternational arbitration. This would contribute to the\nevolution of Gulf-Iranian relations.\nOn another level, the Iraqi crisis, in its turn, has been\nunresolved for years and there are no signs on the horizon\nof an impending, appropriate solution to it. With the\npersistence of this situation in Baghdad, which could erupt\nat any moment, and with all its potential for destabilizing\nthe entire region, the condition of the Iraqi people has\nreached tragic proportions under the effect of the\ninternational sanctions that have been imposed upon the\ncountry for years. Whether or not we are convinced of the\nusefulness of these sanctions in achieving their envisaged\nobjectives, and while we fully assert the need to\nimplement all relevant Security Council resolutions, we\nwould also express the hope that the embargo imposed on\nthe Iraqi people will be lifted in order to mitigate the\nharsh suffering it has caused and the adverse effects it has\nhad on these people.\nWe view with concern the tense situation in the\nneighbouring region of the Horn of Africa, where States\nand people have suffered numerous tragedies and\nhardships as a result of border and civil conflicts and\nwars. These have resulted in the squandering of resources\nand potentials and aggravated the phenomena of poverty,\nstarvation and migration.\nI would like to single out the Republic of the Sudan,\nthe suffering of whose people, we hope, will end in a\nmanner that preserves its territorial integrity and the unity\nof its people. We also hope that all differences among the\nStates of the region will be settled by peaceful means and\non the basis of international legitimacy, so as to ensure\ncooperation and good-neighbourliness among all States\nand peoples.\nFurthermore, we in the State of Qatar feel that the\nlifting of the embargo and sanctions imposed on the sister\nLibyan Jamahiriya is a basic and popular demand,\nespecially in the wake of recent positive developments in\nthis matter. In this regard, we would express our hope and\nconfidence that the efforts currently under way will result\nin a judicial and diplomatic formula satisfactory to all\nparties to this question and put a definitive end to its\nrepercussions. This would ensure the lifting of the\nembargo and the sanctions imposed on Libya and close\nthe file on the Lockerbie question, while doing justice to\nall parties concerned.\nIn the same vein, and proceeding from the strong\nattachment of the State of Qatar to the principle of the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and from its profound\nbelief in the necessity of consolidating security and\nstability and avoiding the dangers of war, hostilities and\nclashes of any kind, I wish to express our great concern\nover the regrettable events unfolding in Afghanistan and\nthe escalation of tension along its borders with Iran.\nWhile stressing our conviction that the best means to\nsolve the Afghan crisis in its various aspects lie in the\ndiplomatic good offices which are proceeding under the\nsupervision and auspices of the United Nations, we appeal\n30\n\n\nto the parties concerned to desist from any action to further\nescalate the conflict or widen its scope.\nMoreover, I cannot but touch upon the tragedy of the\npeople of the Kosovo region, which is now suffering the\nsame civil conflicts, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and mass migration\nthat have plagued other peoples of the former Yugoslavia.\nWhile thanking the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts and\ninitiatives to defuse tensions and settle conflicts throughout\nthe world, we call upon him once again to continue and\nredouble his efforts to end these conflicts and prevent their\nexpansion and escalation, especially in Kosovo,\nAfghanistan, Iraq and Africa.\nThe crises and conflicts I have cited are but examples\nof the magnitude of the challenges and tasks which we\nmust face. There are many thorny questions and\ncomplicated problems to which all of us, the inhabitants of\nthis planet, regardless of our different races and beliefs,\nmust work together to seek solutions, for the sake of our\nfuture and that of our children and grandchildren.\nForemost and most serious among these is the\nquestion of the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, including chemical, biological and, especially,\nnuclear weapons. A few months ago, we, like the entire\nworld, were shocked by the disturbing developments arising\nfrom the exchange of nuclear-weapons tests by India and\nPakistan and by their inherent threat of unleashing a\nconventional and nuclear arms race between those two large\nneighbours. Here, I would like to recall the position of my\ncountry on such tests: We call for the exercise of wisdom\nand the prompt signing by all States, without exception, of\nthe treaties banning nuclear tests and limiting the\nproliferation of these weapons of mass destruction, while\nearnestly seeking to reduce the number of such weapons in\nthe world in preparation for their complete elimination. This\nis specifically what we would like to see in our region,\nwhich, I emphasize, we would wish entirely free of\nweapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons.\nIn this regard, I would point out that Israel is the only\nnuclear-weapon State in the region and the only State that\nhas so far refused to sign the treaties relevant to the\nprohibition of such weapons and the prevention of their\nproliferation. If it persists, this situation will lead to tension\nand the repercussions arising from the imbalance of power\nit causes. Therefore, in our view, it is necessary and\nimperative to take concrete steps to eliminate these weapons\nfrom the region, so as to avoid the risks of launching an\narms race that would further destabilize the region.\nThe State of Qatar also signed the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction, which was concluded in Oslo. We signed it\nofficially in Ottawa last December, prompted by our\nbelief in the correctness of banning these mines and our\nawareness of the many humanitarian tragedies resulting\nfrom their use, especially among innocent civilians in the\nwake of the wars during which they had originally been\nlaid.\nOther worldwide scourges, which we have long seen\nproliferate and expand, are no less serious than weapons\nof mass destruction in terms of their devastating and\ncomprehensive effects on the peoples and States of the\nworld. Drugs, organized crime, famine and the disruption\nof environmental and climatic conditions have all become\nglobal threats. We sincerely believe that it is impossible\nto tackle these threats except through comprehensive\ninternational endeavours and programmes.\nIn this regard, I would like, on behalf of my\nGovernment, to thank and congratulate the friendly\nGovernment of Italy and the delegations of the world that\nparticipated in the United Nations Diplomatic Conference\nof Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court, which was held in Rome\nlast June and July. It culminated in a declaration on the\nestablishment of this Court, the jurisdiction of which will\ninclude trying those responsible for acts of genocide and\nwar criminals.\nI would also like to refer to the twentieth special\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to countering\nthe world drug problem, held in this Hall early last June.\nIt showed us the magnitude of this intractable problem\nand its serious effects on all people of the world without\nexception. My Government would like to thank the\nfriendly Government of Mexico for taking the initiative of\nproposing to the General Assembly the convening of the\nspecial session in order to draw up a comprehensive\ninternational strategy, under the auspices of the United\nNations, to cope with this problem, which threatens\neverybody.\nThe need to protect and conserve the environment\nhas become a pressing question that requires all of us, as\npeoples inhabiting this planet, to devote greater efforts\nand resources to addressing it in a framework of\ncoordination and cooperation on a comprehensive\ninternational level and in the context of the assumption by\neach of us of his own responsibilities and duties. There is\n31\n\n\nno doubt that the environment today has been severely\ndamaged by the faulty policies and practices still pursued\nby some industrial States and institutions. This damage is\nalso a result of mankind?s age-old neglect of and\nindifference to its surroundings. However, the time has now\ncome to undertake a coordinated and serious universal\neffort to put an end to these abuses and practices, which\nclearly threaten the future of the globe and all its peoples\nand regions with a potential calamity.\nThe right of man to live in dignity and freedom\nremains. For the Government and the people of Qatar it is\na sacred divine right, which we must all respect and\nprotect. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm that human rights\nand man?s freedom to live in dignity and security are\nprotected and available everywhere in today?s world. There\nare still numerous disturbing exceptions and violations in\nmany regions and States of the world. Fortunately,\nhowever, we are witnessing significant progress towards\nsubstantial recognition of these legitimate human rights, of\ngreater political, social and cultural democracy and of\nhumanitarian and civilizational openness.\nIt is our sincere hope and desire that that progress will\nbe consolidated and strengthened throughout the world. In\nQatar, we are especially proud that, under the auspices of\nHis Highness the Prince Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa\nAl-Thani and under his instructions, vital pioneering steps\nare being taken to achieve more democracy and to\nconsolidate participation by all segments of the population\nthrough the exercise of responsibility and freedom of\nchoice, the guarantee of social and civil rights and civic\nduty, and respect for freedom of opinion, of speech and of\nthe press within the framework of the laws and the ideals\nand values in which we believe and which we cherish.\nAs we stand today at the threshold of a new century\nwith its attendant rapid and continuous changes,\ntransformations and surprises and face the growing number\nof tasks and the greater challenges they impose, we are\nfirmly convinced of the need for readiness and preparedness\nto meet these challenges, undertake the tasks assigned to us\nand shoulder our responsibilities in a spirit of cooperation,\ncoordination, friendship, mutual respect and commonality\nof interest for the benefit of our countries and peoples.\nProceeding from our deep faith in God Almighty, this\nis the least we can do for ourselves, our countries and our\npeoples and for our one world. Our responsibility to the\nfuture generations dictates that we must provide for them a\nbetter world, a better life and a better future. May God\nguide us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this\nsession. We are confident that his vast experience and\ncapabilities will lead this session to success. I would like\nto assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation.\nAllow me also to express our gratitude to his predecessor,\nthe former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for his\ncommendable efforts and to express similar\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand his able assistants for their efforts to ensure an\nimproved performance by the Organization, to bolster its\nstatus and to achieve its lofty objectives.\nThere are many questions in my country, in our\nArab and African region, and in the rest of the world.\nThere is a war raging between our neighbours on the\neastern and southern borders. All of these questions need\nto be debated.\nThe considerable improvement in the economic\nsituation in the Sudan is reflected in the latest\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) reports, which\nindicate an increase in the growth rate and a reduction in\nthe inflation rate. We expect the Sudan to become an oil-\n30\n\n\nexporting State in the next few months. This is an issue\nwhich we are very happy to brief you on.\nThere is also the constitutional evolution and political\nopenness in the Sudan, culminating in the approval by the\nSudanese people in a referendum of a new constitution\nearlier this year. This will enhance the institutions of civil\ngovernance and the peaceful transfer of power based on a\nsystem of political pluralism. These developments are\nimportant to political stability in Africa?s largest country,\nthe Sudan, a land of vast untapped resources.\nI also wish to talk about the humanitarian situation in\nthe Sudan and the improvements in that situation. Sudan\nappreciates the efforts of the international community and\nexpresses its full commitment to cooperate in the\nfacilitation of these efforts. This is a matter which deserves\nfurther elaboration.\nThere are also the peace efforts in southern Sudan and\nthe positive response of the Sudanese Government to the\ncalls for a ceasefire by the international community,\nincluding the Security Council, the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) and the European\nUnion. This ceasefire was rejected by the rebel movement,\nresulting in the continuation of war and more suffering for\nthe citizens. This also is a matter which requires further\nelaboration.\nAll these questions require more details, but I will\nleave that to other committees and forums, as I shall\nconcentrate today on one single issue: the American\naggression committed against my country on 20 August\n1998. This American act, if not properly addressed, could\nundermine all the achievements made by our people\nthrough years of struggle and suffering.\nIt would be appropriate to recall the events which\nbegan on 7 August. On that day the explosions took place\nin Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. That same evening the\nSudan condemned those heinous terrorist acts. We\nconveyed our condolences to the Presidents and the\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the United States, Kenya\nand the United Republic of Tanzania. I also made telephone\ncalls to my Kenyan and Tanzanian colleagues expressing\nSudan?s fullest readiness to cooperate to the maximum\npossible extent in the efforts to search for, apprehend and\npunish the culprits.\nThe American Administration requested fly-over\npermission for their military aircraft in order to evacuate\nthe wounded and the dead from Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam,\nand their request was granted. That was followed by\nanother request for open fly-over permission for their\nmilitary aircraft, to which we responded promptly and in\ngood faith, as it was, in our view, a humanitarian request\nwhich deserved a response. Subsequently, contacts in this\nregard between the Sudanese and American security\nauthorities were begun. We welcomed these contacts and\ngave assurances of our full cooperation.\nBut, all of a sudden, within minutes and without\nwarning, the Sudanese people were shocked on the\nevening of Thursday, 20 August, by a grave act of\nterrorism, as heinous and cowardly as those of Dar-es-\nSalaam and Nairobi. The \u201cAl-Shifa\u201d pharmaceutical plant,\nwhich only a few hours before that event was producing\nlife-saving medicines for children, women and the elderly\nin the Sudan and which was a model of the economic\ndevelopment of my country, was completely destroyed.\nSome of the innocent Sudanese citizens, employees\nof the factory, lost their lives under the rubble, while\nothers lost their sight, or some of their limbs, or were left\nswimming in blood. Families of the victims and the rest\nof the employees were suddenly bereft of the sources of\ntheir livelihood.\nA few minutes later, we watched the message of the\nAmerican President on television, where he stated that the\nUnited States armed forces had launched air strikes\nagainst the Sudan and Afghanistan. He said that they had\ndestroyed a plant in the Sudan linked to Osama Bin\nLaden which produced chemical weapons.\nThis is the American perspective, which I have\nconveyed to you clearly. What then is the Sudanese\nperspective?\nI would like to state clearly and confidently that the\nfactory produced medicine \u2014 and nothing but medicine.\nThe plant belonged to the private sector. It was owned by\na Sudanese businessman, and it had no link whatsoever\nwith Osama Bin Laden. The factory was financed by the\nPTA Bank of the Common Market for Eastern and\nSouthern Africa (COMESA). It was one of the largest of\nits kind in the Middle East and Africa.\nIn his speech at the inaugural meeting of this session\nof the Assembly, President Clinton spoke about the\ntolerance and greatness of Islam. We appreciate what he\nsaid and would like to add that Islam calls for mutual\nrespect between civilizations, cultures and religions. Islam\ncalls for dialogue \u2014 indeed, all the revealed religions call\n31\n\n\nfor dialogue \u2014 and all of these religions abhor and\nrenounce violence and injustice, because injustice begets\nhatred.\nAll faiths call for justice. The principal rule of law\nstipulates that the accused is innocent until proven guilty.\nHowever, here we are faced with a situation in which the\nSudan was accused by the United States, the Sudan was\ncondemned by the United States and the Sudan was\npunished by the United States. Thus, the United States has\nacted as the adversary, the jury and the judge \u2014 the\nopponent and the arbiter. The whole world rejected the\nAmerican aggression and its justification.\nAllow me to mention here some of those who\nsupported our position in the Sudan: the Arab League, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned\nMovement (NAM), the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC), the Group of 77 and China, and large\nsectors of the American community, including former\nPresident Jimmy Carter, former Attorney-General Ramsey\nClark, a number of Congressmen and the American mass\nmedia. Our position was also supported by high-ranking\nofficials of Western countries, including presidents and\nforeign ministers, as well as by the British, Jordanian and\nAmerican engineers who took part in the construction and\noperation of the factory and who continued their technical\nassociation with it until it was destroyed. A number of legal\nexperts and lawyers from Western countries, as well as\ninternational trade unions and non-governmental\norganizations also voiced their support.\nIn spite of this, the United States continues to oppose\nthe dispatch of a fact-finding mission by the Security\nCouncil. The American officials claim that they analysed a\nsample of the soil near the factory and found that it\ncontained chemical precursors used in the production of\nVX \u2014 a nerve gas.\nIf they are so sure of what they found, we wonder\nwhy they object to the dispatch of a fact-finding mission by\nthe Security Council so that the Council can be the judge.\nThe factory has been destroyed, true; but the soil is still\nthere and the remnants and the rubble of the factory are\nthere. The fact-finding mission can easily collect soil\nsamples and examine the machines, look into the\ndocuments and establish the facts about the output and\nownership of the factory. This is the sole demand of the\nSudan now.\nLast week the Group of Arab States presented a draft\nresolution to the Security Council. The draft does not seek\nto condemn the United States for its violation of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State. It\nonly requests the dispatch of a fact-finding mission to\nverify the allegations that were the basis of the decision\nby the United States to launch a strike against a medicine\nfactory in the Sudan.\nIt is the responsibility, indeed the obligation of the\nSecurity Council to do so. This is only a procedural\nmeasure to ascertain the facts \u2014 a procedure which the\nCouncil has always followed in similar situations.\nTherefore the Sudan and the entire international\ncommunity call on the Security Council to send an urgent\nfact-finding mission to the Sudan so that the international\ncommunity can verify the allegations upon which the\nUnited States based its decision to strike the medicine\nfactory.\nThe Sudan recognizes that sending a fact-finding\nmission is a legitimate request by a developing country\nthat holds dear the principles of international legitimacy\nand believes strongly that the fight against terrorism,\nwhich we condemn in all its forms, whether committed\nby individuals, groups or States, must be based on the\nprinciples and channels of international legitimacy and\ncooperation and the renunciation of force as a means for\nhegemony and domination.\nWe in the Sudan recognize that the United States is\na super-Power, and we do not seek to involve ourselves\nin a confrontation or altercation with that super-Power.\nOn the contrary, we are keen on establishing correct\nrelations with the United States on the basis of mutual\nrespect, common interest and constructive criticism. We\nare ready to engage in a dialogue with the United States\nand to cooperate with it on all issues of common concern.\nThe people of the Sudan respect the American\npeople and are eager to maintain good relations with\nthem. It is incumbent upon the two Governments to work\non reflecting this desire and to strengthen these historic\nrelations.\nWe have paid tribute to the countries that provided\nhumanitarian assistance to those affected by the war in\nsouthern Sudan, including the United States. However, we\nare perplexed by the provocative statement recently made\nby the spokesman of the American Administration when\nhe announced the donation of $25,000 to the victims of\nfloods in the Sudan. The statement claimed that despite\nits differences with the Government of the Sudan, the\nAmerican Administration is concerned about the welfare\nof the Sudanese people.\n32\n\n\nThe American Administration launched 17 cruise\nmissiles to destroy the pharmaceutical factory. Each of\nthose missiles costs $1 million, for a total of $17 million to\ndestroy our factory. Now the United States announces its\ncontribution of $25,000 to the Sudanese victims of the\nfloods, while the damage caused by the floods is estimated\nto exceed $40 million. Had the American Administration\ngenuinely been concerned with the welfare and well-being\nof the Sudanese people, it would not have attacked and\ndestroyed one of our main economic entities, which\nproduced over 50 per cent of the essential and life-saving\nmedicines which the Sudan requires.\nTherefore, on behalf of the Sudanese people, we say\nto the American Administration, that we want our factory\nback, the factory we built with our toil and sweat and\nwhich cost us millions of dollars. We need the medicine of\nwhich our people were deprived as a result of the\ndestruction of the factory, particularly in this time of the\nflooding crisis which caused rampant diseases and\nepidemics, according to United Nations reports.\nAllow me now to briefly reflect on some of the\nconflicts that are taking place in our area, in view of their\ndirect impact on peace and security in the region.\nI start with our eastern borders, where the conflict\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea will undoubtedly lead to a\ndeterioration of the situation in the region. The Sudan,\nwhich still hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from\nthe two neighbouring countries, is strongly affected by this\nconflict. Hence, from this rostrum we urge the two\nneighbouring countries to exercise self-restraint and to\nresort to peaceful means to settle their differences. We also\nhope that the efforts of the OAU will succeed in reaching\na peaceful settlement to this dispute.\nOn the other hand, we are following with great\nconcern the developments in our southern neighbour, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which is suffering from\nexternal interference in its internal affairs. We hope that the\nefforts of the African countries will be successful in\nassisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo in maintaining peace and stability on its territory.\nAs regards the peace process in the Middle East,\nhopes for a final settlement have evaporated as a result of\nthe Israeli intransigence, which placed hurdles on the road\nto peace.\nThe Sudan welcomes the General Assembly resolution\nupgrading the Palestinian participation and supports the\nsteps taken by the Palestinian leadership to declare the state\nof Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital. The Sudan also\ndenounces the Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem and\nchange its demographic composition and legal status.\nFurthermore, the Sudan supports the rights of Syria\nand Lebanon to regain their occupied territories in the\nGolan and in southern Lebanon, and it calls upon the\ninternational community and the Security Council to exert\npressure on Israel to implement the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions and to heed the call for a just peace\nin order for the region to enjoy peace and security.\nThe embargo imposed on Iraq has lasted for too\nlong, and the suffering of the Iraqi people has deepened.\nThousands of women, children and elderly people have\nlost their lives because of the lack of food and medicine,\nand the world is wondering when the blockade will come\nto an end. The latest impasse between the United Nations\nSpecial Commission and Iraq could result in catastrophic\nconsequences in the area. This should prompt the Security\nCouncil to intervene by carrying out a comprehensive\nreview of Iraqi compliance with Security Council\nresolutions with a view to lifting the embargo. The Sudan\ncommends the efforts of the Secretary-General and\nexpresses the hope that these efforts will lead to a\nbreakthrough in the current impasse.\nThe Sudan also wishes to stress the importance of\nresolving the issue of the detainees and the missing\nKuwaitis as a humanitarian question, and it calls for\nredoubling regional and international efforts to settle this\nproblem so that the women and children who have waited\nso long can be reunited with their husbands and parents.\nThis would also eliminate the causes of tension and\nrestore solidarity and reconciliation between Arab nations\nand States.\nAs regards the issue of Lockerbie, we are very much\nconcerned with the embargo imposed on the sisterly\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, our neighbour. The damaging\nconsequences of this embargo have spilled over from\nLibya to the neighbouring countries, including the Sudan,\nwhich has hundreds of thousands of citizens living in the\nJamahiriya. It is a cause for sadness that scores of those\ncitizens have lost their lives while trying to cross the vast\ndesert between the two countries as a result of the air\nblockade imposed on the Jamahiriya. While welcoming\nthe recent positive developments in this issue, we stress\nthe need to provide the guarantees requested by the\nJamahiriya, as referred to by the President of Burkina\nFaso, the current Chairman of the OAU, in his statement\nbefore the Security Council last week.\n33\n\n\nConflicts in Africa have caused numerous difficulties,\nincluding the problems of refugees and displaced persons.\nAs a result, Africa has become host to the largest number\nof refugees in the world. Their number is estimated at more\nthan 8 million, and they live in the harshest conditions.\nIn its efforts to put an end to the suffering of\nrefugees and to find durable solutions to this problem, the\nOAU decided to convene the first ministerial meeting of\nthe Committee on Refugees and Disappeared Persons in\nKhartoum in December 1998 at the level of foreign\nminister. We in the Sudan look forward to the\ninternational community?s effective participation in and\nsupport for this conference in order to ensure its success.\nThe countries of the continent are hopeful that the\nconference will produce results which would assist in\ndealing with this long-standing problem.\nI should like to conclude with a verse from the Holy\nKoran:\n\u201cGod commands justice, the doing of good, and\nliberality to kith and kin. He forbids all shameful\ndeeds, and injustice and rebellion. He instructs you\nthat ye may receive admonition.\u201d (The Holy Koran,\nXVI:90)"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me\nto join the previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti\nmost sincerely, on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. His election is indeed\na recognition of his excellent qualities as an experienced\nand seasoned diplomat committed to the ideals of peace.\nAs I congratulate him today, I am reminded of the\nexcellent role played by Uruguay in assisting\nMozambique to consolidate peace and stability. On behalf\nof my Government, and on my own behalf, I wish to\nseize this opportunity to express our heartfelt tribute to\nthose young men who lost their lives in the search for\npeace in my country.\nLet me also pay well-deserved tribute for the\nexcellent manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, discharged his duties as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its last session.\nI also wish to commend the Secretary-General for\nhis continued devotion to peace and development\nworldwide. His recent initiatives in this regard deserve\nmy Government?s full support, and we look forward to\ncontinuing to work closely with him.\nIn my last address to this body, one year ago, I\nspoke of positive changes which had taken place in my\ncountry. I am pleased to reconfirm today that the people\nof Mozambique remain firm in their determination to\nundertake bold steps aimed at ensuring and further\nstrengthening democracy, good governance and the rule\nof law. Within this context, the first municipal elections\nwere held in June this year, thus consolidating the process\ninitiated with the holding of the general elections four\nyears ago. Preparations are currently under way for the\nforthcoming general elections, scheduled for 1999.\nThe implementation of structural and economic\nreforms under the most severe circumstances over the last\n11 years should be seen within this perspective.\nMozambique is emerging step by step from the scourges\nof war and is gradually proving that, with hard work and\n31\n\n\nadequate international assistance, the country can and will\nbe a valuable partner in the international market place.\nWe believe that by concentrating on economic\nfundamentals \u2014 including low inflation rates, a stable\ncurrency and a transparent exchange-rate policy, stimulating\nprivate-sector growth and increasing foreign and domestic\ninvestment flows \u2014 our economy can achieve the desired\nresults. These measures have enabled Mozambique to\nachieve a growth of 14 per cent in its gross domestic\nproduct last year, compared to a real average growth of\nabout 6.6 per cent from 1991 to 1996. In addition,\nincreased agricultural production, coupled with the\nprivatization of over 900 Government-owned companies\nand the rehabilitation and restructuring of the main elements\nof infrastructure \u2014 such as roads, ports and railways \u2014\nhave significantly contributed to raising productivity and\nhave played a critical role in achieving these encouraging\neconomic results.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on assistance to\nMozambique, which I highly commend, provides a further\naccount of the state of the Mozambican economy today.\nMoreover, the Governments of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) region, in close\ncooperation with the private sector, are taking aggressive\nsteps towards regional integration. These include, inter alia,\nthe launching of mega-projects, such as the Maputo\nDevelopment Corridor, a joint initiative by the\nGovernments of Mozambique and of South Africa; the $1.3\nbillion MOZAL aluminum smelter, recently announced by\nthe London Metals Exchange, a multi-partnership\ninvestment; and the Libombo Spatial Development\nInitiative, involving Mozambique, Swaziland and South\nAfrica.\nNotwithstanding these positive developments, we are\nstill faced with acute problems whose solution is vital if the\ncountry is to maintain the needed stability. The most critical\nof these, without a doubt, is the debt burden, which\ncontinues to be the single most significant impediment to\nnational development.\nMy Government welcomes the decision taken in April\nthis year by the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) with regard to the eligibility of Mozambique to\ndebt relief within the framework of Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We regard this Initiative\nas a recognition by the international community of my\nGovernment?s continued commitment to undertake sound\npolitical and economic reforms, and also of the suffering\nendured by our people throughout these years of the\nimplementation of such measures.\nWhile representing a significant step in the right\ndirection, the Initiative in its present form is not yet a\ndefinite solution to the debt problem. Further assistance\nby the international community, and the creditor\ncommunity in particular, is required. We need to ensure\nthe irreversibility of the positive developments, especially\ntaking into account that even with current relief measures,\npoor countries, particularly the least developed countries,\nremain poor. We would therefore encourage the creditor\nand donor communities to continue to review and\nconsider new relief measures, including the cancellation\nof official bilateral debt, in order to ensure that the\naffected countries can redirect their meagre resources to\nsocial programmes.\nAs a matter of fact, the eleventh meeting of the\nConsultative Group for Mozambique is taking place\ntomorrow in Maputo. The holding of this meeting on\nMozambican soil for the first time symbolizes the\ngrowing relationship between Mozambique and its\npartners, and my Government will do its utmost to ensure\na successful outcome of the proceedings with the creditor\ncommunity.\nMoreover, we are still confronted with the issue of\nthe prevailing threat of anti-personnel landmines, which\ncontinue to disrupt the very existence of nations and\npeoples. For this reason, my Government has signed and\nratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction. We did so as a\nrecognition of the imperative need to find durable\nsolutions to this issue. We warmly welcome the fortieth\nratification, by Burkina Faso, which will enable the\nConvention to enter into force, and we hope other\ncountries will do the same as soon as possible.\nIn this regard, my Government offered to host in\nMaputo next year the first meeting of States parties to the\nOttawa Convention, in accordance with article 11 of the\nConvention. It is our hope that the meeting will result in\nthe adoption of meaningful recommendations to address\nin a comprehensive manner the issue of anti-personnel\nlandmines, particularly international cooperation and\nassistance and other relevant issues envisaged by this\nimportant instrument of international humanitarian law.\nWe are eager to welcome all of you to Maputo.\n32\n\n\nLet me take this opportunity to express my\nGovernment?s deep gratitude and appreciation to the\npioneering role of Canada on this issue. It is my hope that\nall interested parties will take an active part in the\ndeliberations within the framework of the draft resolution\nto be presented in the First Committee.\nLast April, the Secretary-General presented his report\nto the Security Council on the causes of conflict and the\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\nAfrica. We wish to commend him for his vision in\npreparing that report. The Secretary-General?s report\nrepresents a valuable contribution for a better understanding\nof African problems and offers concrete recommendations\nfor durable solutions by the international community. All\nefforts should be deployed to ensure that that report does\nnot follow the negative examples of other similarly\nimportant reports prepared by the United Nations before.\nI am particularly thankful for the recommendation that\neconomic sanctions should be better targeted in order to\nprevent the unnecessary suffering of innocent people, as we\nhave been witnessing over the years.\nThe concept of peace-friendly structural adjustment\nprogrammes should be fully implemented in order to\nminimize the negative consequences of such programmes\nfor the well-being of peoples. As outlined in these\nrecommendations: conditionalities should not be antithetical\nto peace processes; donors should not cut off funds from\nweak governments which, in good faith, are making\npopularly supported efforts to implement peace agreements;\naid should be focused on high-impact areas to reduce\ndependence; donors should strive to ensure that at least 50\nper cent of their aid to Africa is spent in Africa; and the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative\nshould be expanded to benefit more African countries.\nThese recommendations deserve our full support, and what\nis now required of us is to find the best ways and means of\nputting them into practice.\nI would also agree with the Secretary-General when he\nstresses that, without political will, Africa will remain\nbehind, with nothing to offer to future generations. For\nthese reasons, I wish to endorse the proposed holding of\nSecurity Council meetings at ministerial level on a biennial\nbasis to assess efforts undertaken and actions needed in this\nregard. Moreover, the convening of the Security Council at\nsummit level within five years to discuss the situation in\nAfrica could not be more timely. Indeed, it is high time for\nthe Council to devote the necessary attention to African\nproblems if the international community is to ensure a\nbetter future for the African continent.\nToday as yesterday, globalization is a matter of fact.\nHowever, we cannot afford to leave vast segments of\nnations and peoples unattended and still confronting basic\nchallenges such as famine, epidemic diseases and\ninadequate water distribution, among other challenges. As\nan African, I am certain that Africa is prepared to\nshoulder its responsibilities in this regard, so that together\nwe will be able to work towards a common goal.\nThe crisis which initially begun as an isolated case\nin the Asian economies has rapidly spread to virtually all\ncontinents. Its consequences have demonstrated that no\ncountry in this globalized economy is immune to the\nsuffering of other nations. Adequate solutions lie in\nsustainable development based on partnership in\ndevelopment cooperation. The persistence of extreme\npoverty in developing countries, particularly in the least\ndeveloped ones, will continue to represent a threat to the\neconomies of developed countries. The new vision which\nappears to emerge from the Bretton Woods institutions,\nbringing together the United Nations and other partners in\nthe solution of social problems, will contribute to\naddressing major challenges facing our countries today.\nI would like to take this opportunity to praise the\ntwo-day high-level meetings of the General Assembly\nheld a few days ago on renewal of the dialogue on\nstrengthening international cooperation for development\nthrough partnership and on the social and economic\nimpact of globalization and interdependence and their\npolicy implications. The meetings demonstrated the need\nto bring together governments, the private sector and\nother relevant segments of civil society in the search for\nsolutions to global problems.\nWe therefore hope that the ongoing reform of the\nUnited Nations will open new windows for the\nOrganization to strengthen its role and functions in the\npromotion of international cooperation for the social and\neconomic development of developing countries. As has\nbeen emphasized, the United Nations, by virtue of its\nuniversal membership, is the most credible instrument for\nperforming development tasks.\nRegional conflicts continue to be a major concern on\nthe agenda of the United Nations. Despite the recent\nsigning of understandings at Victoria Falls, the hostilities\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue\nunabated. We are deeply concerned by the course of\n33\n\n\nevents, which threatens not only the territorial integrity of\nthat country but also peace and stability in the Great Lakes\nregion as a whole. We believe that with good will there can\nbe a solution addressing the concerns of all parties involved\nin this conflict. Neither Africa nor the international\ncommunity can afford to add a new chapter of conflicts of\nregional proportions, especially taking into account that\nvirtually all other long-standing conflicts in that continent\ncontinue to defy our collective imagination.\nWith respect to Angola, we are equally concerned with\ncontinued procrastination by Mr. Savimbi in the\nimplementation of undertakings within the framework of the\nLusaka Protocol and of relevant Security Council\nresolutions. It is, indeed, the failure of Uni\u00e3o Nacional para\na Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA) to live up to its\nobligations which is leading the peace process in Angola to\nthe brink of collapse. Both the international community and\nthe parties concerned have an obligation to rescue the\nsuffering people of Angola from the prospect of yet another\nconflict of major proportions. The attainment of peace in\nAngola would undoubtedly contribute to bringing about\nneeded stability in the region.\nWe are fully associated with the progress made by the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and by the\nEconomic Community of West African States in the search\nfor the peace which has eluded Guinea-Bissau since the\noutbreak of hostilities in that country. These positive\ndevelopments underline the importance of political will by\nthe parties concerned, which should prevail in conflict\nsituations. My Government is also encouraged by the\ndevelopments concerning Western Sahara, and looks\nforward to the holding of the referendum in that Territory.\nIt is our hope that wisdom and statesmanship will\nprevail, and that peace and stability will ultimately become\na reality in Somalia, the Horn of Africa, the Sudan and\nother troubled regions of the African continent and beyond.\nWe are encouraged by the recent developments\nconcerning East Timor, as illustrated by the outcome of the\nmost recent meeting, held in New York, between the\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and of Portugal\nunder the auspices of the Secretary-General. We wish to\nencourage them to pursue further these efforts with a view\nto finding a lasting and internationally acceptable solution\nto this issue.\nMy Government has been following with keen interest\nthe latest developments in the Middle East. We have good\nreason to be disappointed by the course of events since the\nlast session of the General Assembly. Without a\ncomprehensive and just solution to the question of\nPalestine, which is the core of the conflict in the Middle\nEast, as well as respect for the legitimate interests of all\npeoples of the region, the prospects for a lasting peace\nremain in danger.\nIn addition, the latest developments concerning\nnuclear proliferation in South Asia have added new\nelements of destabilization to the already volatile\ninternational security environment. The new arms race in\nthat region constitutes a major setback in the international\nefforts aimed at ensuring peace, security and stability in\nthat region and in the world at large. Rather than\nproviding security guarantees for the countries concerned,\nthe new reality has in fact exacerbated the tensions in the\nregion.\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place at\nan auspicious time for all the peoples of the world: 1998\nwill be recorded as the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Through concrete\nactions the international community must honour those\nwho have lost their lives in defence of human dignity\nduring the 50 years of the existence of the Universal\nDeclaration. Through concrete actions we must ensure\nthat the horrors and uncertainties of the past and the\ncontinued violations of fundamental human rights are not\nrepeated in the new millennium. We must devise\nappropriate strategies and find ways and means which\nwill enable future generations to live in harmony, peace\nand development, and which will prevent the recurrence\nof the abuses of human dignity that have been witnessed\nthroughout human history.\nIt is only through such actions that we can ensure\nthat the motto of \u201call human rights for all\u201d is fully\nrealized. As the Secretary-General once reminded us,\nhuman rights belong to no Government and are limited to\nno continent, for they are fundamental to humankind\nitself.\nWe in Mozambique look forward to the celebrations\nas a source of momentum in educating ourselves about\nthe scope and magnitude of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, taking into account that the\npromotion and protection of these rights is essentially\neveryone?s responsibility. However, we recognize the\nprimary responsibility of the State in ensuring the\nenjoyment of human rights by our citizens. My\nGovernment underscores the need to assert the integrated,\ninterdependent and indivisible nature of all categories of\nrights, in which both political and civil rights, and\n34\n\n\neconomic, social and cultural rights, including the right to\ndevelopment, are treated equally. The programme we have\nprepared, which will culminate in a major celebration on 10\nDecember, is in conformity with these principles.\nThe establishment in Rome last July of the\nInternational Criminal Court represents a remarkable\ncontribution by mankind to the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights all over the world. In Rome we created an\nunprecedented comprehensive legal framework to\nsafeguard human rights and bring to justice those\nresponsible for the most heinous crimes ever witnessed by\nhumanity, such as those committed in the recent cases of\nRwanda and of the former Yugoslavia.\nAlthough we would have liked a Court with more\nfar-reaching powers, we understand that the present\nstatute adopted in Rome represents a very delicate and\ndifficult compromise achieved through very long and\npainful negotiations. Efforts must be made to make\npossible the early entry into force of the statute of the\nCourt. We must also explore all possible avenues offered\nby the statute to improve the functioning and competence\nof the Court. That course of action would undoubtedly\nprovide better acceptance of the statute of the Court and\nwould ultimately ensure its universality.\nOur success in tackling the human rights issue,\nsustainable development and conflict resolution as well as\nin finding consensus on the major issues within the\nframework of the ongoing process of reform of our\nOrganization will greatly depend on the manner in which\nwe can accommodate our individual and collective\ninterests. Let us work together to ensure the attainment of\nthese objectives, and to enable the United Nations to fulfil\nits obligations as we enter the new millennium.\n"

        "file_text": "Omar Aguirre, of Bolivia; Lisa Malone, of\nAustralia; Pablo Gorga, of Uruguay; Luis Escoto, of Spain;\nPedro Ruz, of Chile; together with Guatemalans Rolando\nPalacios and Celso Mart'nez, all of them United Nations\npersonnel stationed in Guatemala to collaborate in the\nverification of the peace agreements, gave their lives in\ncarrying out their mission, when they died in a tragic air\naccident, on 17 March 1998, as they were travelling to a\nremote area to perform their duties. With the Assembly\u2019s\npermission, I would like to pay a sincere tribute to those\nwho, at a time of peace, generously gave their lives for\npeace in Guatemala.\nEqually moved by the destruction left by hurricane\nGeorges in its passage through the Dominican Republic,\nHaiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica,\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and other Caribbean territories and\nthe southern United States, I wish to express the solidarity\nof the people and the Government of Guatemala with those\nwho suffered economic losses and the inconsolable pain\nof the loss of human lives.\nGuatemala feels honoured to welcome Mr. Opertti to\nthe roster of eminent persons who have had the privileged\nresponsibility of conducting the debates of this forum\nthroughout its existence. His election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session, while\nshowing recognition of his great diplomatic talent, is the\nnatural result of the efforts that he and his country have\nmade in promoting understanding among the peoples and\nthe nations of the world.\nWe are fully convinced that our Organization will\nbenefit from his ample experience as one of the\nsupporters of the principles of the inter-American system.\nThis guarantees that the excellent work of his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, will be continued,\nand we wish to express our appreciation for the excellent\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the General\nAssembly during the year of his mandate.\nThis is the second time that Guatemala has\naddressed the General Assembly since the signature of the\npeace agreements that put an end to the fratricidal\nstruggle that senselessly tore our nation apart for almost\nfour decades. I must again acknowledge the solidarity the\ninternational community showed throughout the process,\nespecially during the difficult and protracted task of\nimplementing the accords, which will lead us to the\nreconstruction of our society and the fulfilment of our\nhighest aspirations for economic development, equity and\njustice.\nThe United Nations and the Government and the\npeople of Guatemala have worked together in the\nimplementation of the peace agreements. Under the\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\n(MINUGUA) we have gone forward with firm and sure\nsteps in complying with the accords, and it is with great\nsatisfaction that I can report to the Assembly that the\ntimetable of the accords is being met with sure progress.\nThat is why we welcome the recent report of the\nSecretary-General on the status of verification of the\npeace agreements in Guatemala (A/53/288), and we\nstrongly support his recommendation that the General\nAssembly authorize the renewal of MINUGUA\u2019s mandate\nuntil 31 December 1999.\nAs a Member of an Organization whose main\nobjective is to preserve peace among nations, our own\n15\n\n\nexperience of living in peace leads us to reaffirm our belief\nin multilateralism as a genuine form of pooling efforts for\ncoexistence among the peoples of the world. To the\nordinary citizen of Guatemala, regional organizations, sister\nnations and international commitments are no longer\nregarded as abstractions, instead becoming elements of our\nreality which, added to our political and cultural experience,\nis producing a new synthesis of the local with the global.\nThat new synthesis in Guatemala means peace, which is\nrooted in the happy conjunction of the ancestral pacifism of\nour own ancient cultures with the universally accepted\nethical values promoted in the various centres of\nmultilateral convergence, both regionally and globally.\nThese positive results have also been factors in\naccelerating our involvement in regional cooperation\ninitiatives, especially in the process of Central American\nintegration, in which Guatemala, determined to achieve it,\nhas made significant efforts, motivated by the view shared\nby the other actors in the process that a united Central\nAmerica will be much more capable of facing the\nchallenges of globalization for the benefit of our peoples.\nBelieving also that the centres of multilateral\nadministration are fundamental to promoting peace and\ndevelopment, we have been motivated to participate\nactively in the tasks of consolidating the work of the\nAssociation of Caribbean States, an organization of 25\nmember States sharing the Caribbean Sea as their common\nheritage and having the most varied cultural and linguistic\ntraditions. This Association has decided to unite in order to\nexplore the regional potential for promoting conditions that\nwill improve the living standards of their citizens.\nWe do not have time to continue listing the various\nregional integration initiatives. However, they exemplify the\nimportance that Guatemala attaches to multilateral bodies in\nefforts to coexist under conditions of justice and equality\nand in an environment which is increasingly interactive and\ninterdependent. The global condition of the contemporary\nworld is no longer expressed recurrently through periodic\nevents, but is rather a daily constant that, every minute,\nconcerns all individuals on the planet. It poses challenges\nthat may be regarded as either opportunities or threats and\nthat elicit a full spectrum of responses, from naive\nenthusiasm to irrational fundamentalist resistance.\nThat is why multilateral administration requires\nrenewed, flexible and participatory institutions that respond\nto the dynamic conditions derived from the development of\ninternational relations in the post-cold-war era. Thus,\nGuatemala has followed with interest modernization efforts\nwithin this Organization. We have enthusiastically\nassumed the responsibility of contributing to the\nimplementation of administrative reforms through a pilot\nproject.\nWe are pleased at the progress that has been made\nin this area, and we would like to express once again our\nappreciation for the support we have received from the\nagencies of the United Nations system, which, under the\ncoordination of the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), are helping us with the process of\npeace and development and making system-wide reform\na reality in our country.\nThe work undertaken by Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan in response to the concerns of Member States\nregarding the modernization of our Organization deserves\nour very special recognition. Last July, the Secretary-\nGeneral honoured us with a visit to Guatemala, and we\nsaw for ourselves the determination and commitment he\ndemands of himself in order to strengthen our\nOrganization and the clear vision of the future that guides\nhis efforts towards the new millennium.\nGuatemala agrees with other Members on the need\nto continue the deliberations on the reform of the Security\nCouncil. We have studied with interest the various\nproposals that have been presented, and we hope that\ndespite the differences in their current positions, Member\nStates will be able to reach the necessary level of\nagreement and understanding in order to bring about a\nreform that is equitable for all regions and that\ndemonstrates the democratic will that should prevail in\nthe Organization.\nI must emphasize the important role that the United\nNations must play in the creation, codification and\napplication of the norms of international law. A greater\ninvolvement by the Organization in this matter would\npromote greater creativity on the part of Member States\nin confronting shared problems and would eliminate legal\nambiguities that could enable national legislatures to\ndictate international laws which would then be imposed\non less developed countries. We call upon the community\nof nations to redouble its efforts in this area.\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, and in\nresponse to an international society that is increasingly\ninterdependent, we call for a more equitable and just\norder in the sphere of trade, with clear rules and equal\nopportunities for all regions and States. This is the only\nway to promote development in areas where there is an\n16\n\n\nimperative need to eliminate poverty and build more just\nsocieties.\nAs the President of Colombia expressed very well in\nthis Assembly, development should take into account the\nhuman side of our societies. We must keep striving to\naccomplish more internal equity in the distribution of\nresources and burdens. But it is increasingly difficult, under\npresent conditions, to comply with the demands of the\ninternational institutions that finance development, without\nsacrificing the lives of our people, who are already, for the\nmost part, mired in poverty. We are also greatly alarmed to\nsee an insecure and uncertain worldwide economic situation\nin which dubious speculative practices continue to wreak\nhavoc in the absence of effective controls by those\nresponsible. The world is filling up with products that\npopulations and countries no longer have the means to\nacquire, and there is no longer any place for our small\neconomies.\nNow that the Central American countries are making\nefforts on various fronts to accomplish our integration and\nliberalize our economies, and as we strive to leave years of\narmed confrontation behind us and adapt to the demands of\nthe world market, our products must have fair, non-\ndiscriminatory access to world markets, and our potential as\na competitive destination for productive investment must be\nrecognized.\nOne of the most important subjects on the agenda of\nthe General Assembly is that of disarmament. Guatemala,\ntogether with the other Central American countries,\ncondemns any type of nuclear testing. We expressed our\nconcern over the recent tests carried out in other continents.\nSuch activities do not contribute to the peace or the nuclear\ndisarmament that most of the Member States of this\nOrganization desire.\nGuatemala was also among the first countries to sign\nthe Ottawa Convention prohibiting the manufacture and use\nof anti-personnel mines. We ask those countries that have\nnot yet done so to become parties to this Convention.\nWe also note with great satisfaction that the concerns\nof Member States relating to the subject of weapons are\ngrowing in scope to include the proliferation, illegal traffic\nand abuse of small arms. Guatemala is extremely interested\nin the quest for a solution to this problem, and we believe\nthat the Oslo platform can generate satisfactory responses.\nWe are extremely concerned to see that although to a\nlarge extent it has been possible to overcome internal\nconflicts in most Member States, the international\ncommunity continues to be shocked by such horrendous\nacts of international terrorism as those that recently\ncaused much bloodshed in Africa and Northern Ireland.\nIn addition to condemning and unanimously rejecting\nthese vile and cowardly actions that primarily affect\ninnocent human beings who have nothing to do with the\ncauses that are invoked, the international community must\nobserve the resolution of the Rome Conference on the\nStatute of the International Criminal Court to the effect\nthat\n\u201cterrorist acts, by whomever and wherever\nperpetrated and whatever their forms, methods or\nmotives, are serious crimes of concern to the\ninternational community\u201d. (A/Conf.183/10, annex I,\nsection E, second paragraph)\nAs is well known, Guatemala was one of the last\nstaging grounds of the cold war, where transnational\nnetworks operated with impunity in support of the dirty\nwar taking place inside and outside of the country. We\nwish to express once again our firm and emphatic\npolitical resolve that never again will our territory be used\nto prepare any type of aggression against any other\ncountry.\nAs the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights draws near, Guatemala\nreaffirms its resolute commitment to honouring the\nprinciples contained in the Declaration. One of the most\nimportant tasks of the Government of President Alvaro\nArz\u00fa has been to promote fulfilment of and respect for\nhuman rights in all aspects of life in our country. The\nhuman rights dimension has been integrated into all\nspheres of civic life, and, although we still have much to\ndo in that area, we have certainly made great progress,\npromoting the full blossoming of our rich ethnic,\nmulticultural and multilingual diversity.\nThe United Nations, founded in 1945 on the ideal of\nkeeping peace in the world and with the fundamental role\nof ensuring that all nations can coexist on the basis of\nmutual respect among States, is the highest expression of\nrepresentation by all peoples. However, 53 years after the\nbirth of the United Nations, there are still territories\nwhose citizens are not represented here. My country is\naware of the divisions that persist between brothers in the\nMiddle East, Asia and Africa. We hope that their\ndifferences can be resolved through dialogue and in a\npeaceful manner, so that, without any form of rejection or\n17\n\n\ndiscrimination, all the peoples of the world may be\nrepresented in the United Nations.\nI wish to mention in particular the situation of the 22\nmillion citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan, as\nwell as the importance and soundness of their economy\namid so much financial uncertainty in that region.\nOur Organization must face great challenges as the\nnew century draws near. We hope that, with the goodwill\nof all Member States, we can resolutely embark on it so as\nto ensure the survival of the human race, as well as lives\nlived in peace, the protection of our environment, economic\ngrowth and sustainable development. Only in that way will\nwe achieve the dream of those who, full of ideals, founded\nthe United Nations in San Francisco in 1945.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nthird session, convinced as I am that under your leadership\nand with your vast experience and profound knowledge of\ninternational affairs the work of the session will be\nsuccessful. I would also like to take this opportunity to\nsalute your friendly country of Uruguay.\nI would also like to express thanks to Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko for his successful conduct of the work of our\nprevious session. I would like to extend, as well, our deep\nthanks to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, for the earnest determination and great\ncompetence he has brought to bear on the matters entrusted\nto him.\nThis fifty-third session of the General Assembly is\nbeing held as we bid farewell to the current century and\nprepare to usher in a new millennium. A large portion of\nhumanity is still facing international conditions that do not\ncome close to enabling them to achieve their ambition and\ntheir hope to live in a world where peace, international\njustice, economic development and life in dignity prevail.\nDespite some signs of economic development in\ncertain third world countries, the general trend points to an\nincreasing gap between the advanced world and the\ndeveloping world. The developing world is facing major\nchanges over which it has no control, including a heavy\ndebt burden, dwindling prices for raw materials, difficulty\nin gaining access to markets, financial speculation and low\nforeign investments.\nThis situation demands that our Organization not\nmerely confine itself to preserving international peace and\nsecurity in the classical sense, but go beyond that and seek\nto reduce the economic and social burden of developing\ncountries. This would contribute to the emergence of a new\nworld order based on consensus, consultation and\npartnership among all countries.\nSince its independence, Morocco has firmly believed\nin the need to base its economic policy on the principle\nof free enterprise and external openness as a means of\nachieving the country?s economic progress and social\ndevelopment.\nThus Morocco made an effective contribution to the\nmultilateral trade negotiations that resulted in the\nfounding of the World Trade Organization in Marrakech.\nMorocco will also participate, with the same degree\nof resolution, in the forthcoming negotiations with other\nMember States to ensure that the international community\nachieves equitable distribution of the dividends of the\ninternational trade system, without overlooking the need\nfor proper coordination of monetary, financial and trade\npolicies, lest the financial crisis currently affecting certain\ninternational markets have adverse effects on the\neconomies of other countries.\nOne of the world?s primary political trouble spots,\nindeed one of the most complex problems threatening\nworld peace and security, is the problem of the Middle\nEast. The many resolutions of the United Nations aimed\nat finding a solution to this problem have failed to enable\nthe Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable and\nlegitimate rights or to compel Israel to withdraw from the\nPalestinian territories, including Jerusalem \u2014 Al-Quds \u2014\nand the other occupied territories in the Golan Heights\nand southern Lebanon. Those resolutions met only with\nIsraeli rejection and defiance.\nIn this respect, the reneging by the current Israeli\nGovernment on the implementation of the agreements\nsigned as part of the peace process following the Madrid\nconference and the Oslo meetings dashed the hopes that\nhad been pinned on those agreements and again plunged\nthe region into a spiral of despair and instability.\nIsrael?s reneging is quite obvious in its current\nprocrastination tactics as well as its attempts to impose a\npolicy of fait accompli through the building of further\nsettlements in the occupied territories, in violation of all\ninternational norms and laws. Recently, Israel further\ncompounded the situation by implementing, in a\nprovocative way, a policy for the Judaization of\nJerusalem \u2014 Al-Quds \u2014 by changing its cultural and\ndemographic characteristics and surrounding it with\nsettlement colonies. The latest such measure was the\nannouncement by the Israeli Government last June of the\nexpansion of the municipal boundaries of Al-Quds, as\npart of what is known as \u201cGreater Jerusalem\u201d.\n32\n\n\nThe entire Islamic world, as it denounces and\ncondemns these practices, which affect the status of\nAl-Quds as an integral part of the Palestinian territories\noccupied in 1967, considers all these Israeli practices as\nnull and void. This was indeed confirmed by the meeting\nof the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, under the chairmanship of His Majesty\nKing Hassan II, in Casablanca at the end of July.\nMorocco believes that this problem can be solved only\nthrough respect for the letter and spirit of the agreements\nsigned and through the implementation of the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy, especially the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, in a way that will guarantee the right\nof the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the\nestablishment of their independent state, with Al-Quds as its\ncapital, and the return of the occupied Arab territories to\ntheir legitimate owners.\nDespite the tremendous potential and enormous\nresources available in Africa, and despite the fact that most\nAfrican countries carry out appropriate economic policies,\nthe African continent is still suffering from serious political,\neconomic and social crises which have led to the\nmarginalization of our continent and the shrinkage of its\nrole in the international arena.\nSome of these crises are clearly reflected in worsening\nunemployment, increased debt burden, falling prices for\ncommodities exported by African countries, inadequate\nforeign investment and declining foreign assistance, which\nstands at barely 0.22 per cent of the gross national product\nof developed countries, despite the fact that the amount\nagreed upon is 0.7 per cent.\nIt is indeed regrettable that the deterioration of the\neconomic situation has contributed to a resurgence of\npolitical instability and military confrontations in certain\nAfrican regions, as is the case at present in the Great Lakes\nregion, the Horn of Africa and Western Africa.\nWhile expressing concern about this situation,\nMorocco supports efforts aimed at containing these crises\nand at guaranteeing the countries of those regions,\nespecially the Democratic Republic of the Congo, their\nterritorial integrity, stability and security. In this respect,\nMorocco commends the efforts made by the States\nmembers of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) to find a solution to the crises in Liberia\nand Sierra Leone. We hope that the efforts being made to\novercome the crisis in Guinea-Bissau will soon be\nsuccessful.\nIn order to find a solution to African economic\nproblems and their political repercussions, we would like\nto reaffirm the proposal made by His Majesty King\nHassan II during the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) meeting in Marrakesh for adopting an\ninternational plan similar to the Marshall Plan, with a\nview to ensuring African economic revival.\nWe would like to thank the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization for the important report he prepared on\nAfrica at the request of the Security Council. We hope\nthat the international community will seek to give\nconcrete substance to its recommendations through the\nsettlement of conflicts and the strengthening of security\nand stability in our continent so as to contribute to the\nnecessary conditions for its economic and social\ndevelopment.\nMorocco has consistently affirmed that its\nmembership in the Arab Maghreb Union is a free and\nstrategic option which is irreversible, dictated by its\nhistoric and civilizational roots, as well as by its current\nand future interests. Given the existence of this\nmembership, Morocco cannot but express its deep\nconcern over the continuing suffering of the brotherly\nLibyan people as a result of the air embargo imposed on\nthem, which caused them a great deal of hardship.\nWe welcome the approval by the United States and\nthe United Kingdom of the Libyan proposal, which was\nsupported by the League of Arab States, the Organization\nof the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned\nMovement, to try the two Libyan suspects in a neutral\ncountry.\nOn the other hand, we deeply regret the suffering of\nanother Arab people \u2014 the Iraqi people \u2014 as a result of\nthe pernicious effects of the economic embargo imposed\non that country. We hope that the agreement reached\nbetween the Iraqi Government and the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, will lead to a resumption of cooperation\nbetween Iraq and the United Nations so that the embargo\ncan be lifted and the hardships of this brotherly people\ncan be ended. We also hope that the Secretary-General\nwill succeed in finding a definitive solution to this\nprotracted crisis.\nAs a Mediterranean State geographically located near\nEuropean States, Morocco has been taking a special\ninterest, as always, in efforts to consolidate Euro-\nMediterranean cooperation. However, Morocco cannot but\nbe concerned about the continuing status of the Moroccan\n33\n\n\ncities of Ceuta and Melilla and the neighbouring islands,\nwhich are still under Spanish occupation, at a time when\nthe page of colonialism in most parts of the world has been\nturned.\nHis Majesty King Hassan II proposed some time ago\nthe setting up of a Moroccan-Spanish panel to consider and\nfind a solution to this abnormal situation, in a way that\nwould guarantee Morocco?s sovereignty over its territory\nwhile taking into account the economic interests of Spain.\nAlthough the Spanish authorities have not yet reacted\nto this fair proposal, Morocco remains convinced that the\ndepth of its historical and economic ties with neighbouring\nSpain, coupled with the aspirations of the two peoples to\nachieve greater rapprochement, cooperation and\nparticipation in many fields, will be sufficient to enable the\ntwo countries to reach a formula for a definitive solution to\nthis problem.\nWith regard to developments in the referendum\nprocess in our southern provinces \u2014 the area known as\nWestern Sahara \u2014 we can only point out that it is still\nexperiencing some difficulties. The identification process\nwas stalled from the outset because the other party, without\njustification, refused to take part in the identification of a\nlarge number of candidates. Yet these candidates fulfilled\nthe agreed criteria and had been registered by the United\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.\nOnce again we are now faced with the refusal of the other\nparty to participate in the identification of these candidates,\nwho this time presented themselves in accordance with the\nHouston agreements that the other party had, indeed, also\naccepted.\nThose agreements confirmed the right of candidates to\nbe identified and reasserted the validity of oral testimony.\nIndeed, in accordance with those agreements, the two\nparties had agreed to begin, as soon as possible, the\nidentification of any individual who may present himself or\nherself for that purpose.\nWe can only express deep concern over these\ndevelopments, which will delay the referendum operation\nwhich has been long awaited by Morocco and the Saharan\nrefugee brothers who have been yearning for more than 20\nyears to return to their homeland, Morocco, in order to\nparticipate in their region?s ongoing development. This will\nprobably also have repercussions on the building of the\ngreater Maghreb to which the peoples of the region aspire.\nThe relentless determination to exclude a number of\nSaharans from participation in the referendum casts still\nmore doubts on the will of the other party to ensure the\nnecessary conditions for the organization of a fair and\ntransparent referendum.\nWe hope that the tremendous progress the world is\ncurrently witnessing will be a factor leading to the\nemergence of solidarity among all peoples, solidarity that\nwill contribute to ensuring greater advancement towards\ndevelopment, security, peace and the spread of tranquillity\nand prosperity among all peoples of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. With your experience and dedication to the\ngoals of this Organization, you will guide us wisely and\neffectively in our work this year.\nAnd important work it is, for as the century draws\nto a close, our security is more precarious than ever. The\nspectrum of threats is wide and growing. Traditional\ndangers persist, including the proliferation of weapons.\nBut new threats \u2014 terrorism, crime and drugs \u2014 arise\nfrom a world in which the face of conflict has changed.\nEconomic and social insecurity for the majority of our\nglobal population is on the rise. Increasingly, it is the\nwell-being of individuals that is directly at stake.\n(spoke in French)\nThere is an urgent need for solutions. The\ninterdependence of all of our lives is unprecedented. It is\nessential for us to work together to confront these\nchallenges. This means working through a vibrant United\nNations. For Canada, the universal values set out in the\nCharter have acted as our moral compass in setting our\nglobal agenda. The United Nations system serves as the\ninstrument in achieving our goals.\n(spoke in English)\nAt the same time we recognize that the United\nNations faces its own worries, and it, too, must change.\nBut a strong, reinvigorated United Nations is still the best\nfoundation for the future. As the contours of that future\nemerge, there is reason for hope. While old realities of\npower persist, a new system based on humanitarian\nstandards, practices and law based upon needs and human\nsecurity is beginning to show through.\nPerhaps this new reality can best be seen in the\ncommon effort to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. The\nSecretary-General has hailed the adoption of the Ottawa\nConvention as an unprecedented achievement \u2014 one\naccomplished through a unique partnership of non-\ngovernmental organizations, Member States and\ninternational groups working together to eliminate a\nweapons system that victimizes the innocent.\n23\n\n\nLast week, Burkina Faso deposited the fortieth\nratification of the treaty, thereby crossing the threshold\nneeded to bring the treaty into force. This treaty, which has\nalready attracted 130 signatories and 41 ratifications, will\nbecome part of the international legal framework as of 1\nMarch next year. We welcome the offer by Mozambique to\nhost the first meeting of the States parties to the\nConvention. We continue to urge those who have not done\nso to sign and ratify the Convention and join in this\ninternational endeavour.\nBut entry into force is just the first important step in\nbringing the treaty to life. Now we have to meet the\ntreaty?s goals. An effective coalition for action must work\ntogether in this next phase to take the mines out of the\nground and to help the victims. The United Nations,\nthrough its mine action service, will mobilize and\ncoordinate the efforts of the international community.\nAt the signing of the treaty on landmines in Ottawa\nlast December, countries pledged $0.5 billion for mine\naction. My own Government has allocated $100 million as\nCanada?s contribution to rid the world of these very cruel\nweapons. We have already put the money to work in some\nof the most severely affected States, with projects in\nMozambique, Cambodia, Bosnia and Central America. Now\nwe must put everyone?s resources to work.\nLandmines are not the only weapons that take a tragic,\ndisproportionate toll on civilian populations. Small arms\nand light military weapons \u2014 cheap and easy to transport,\nsmuggle or hide \u2014 have become the tools of choice for\nsmugglers, terrorists and criminals.\nThe challenges arising from the proliferation and\nwidespread abuse of small arms and light weapons are\ncomplex. But the impact on all of us, especially the most\nvulnerable, is direct and devastating. Eighty per cent of the\nvictims are women and children. There are no easy\nsolutions and no shortcuts. We cannot, however, afford to\nshrink from facing such a pervasive threat to our security.\nIn Canada we pursue a three-pronged approach, dealing\nwith the legal trade, illicit trafficking and peace-building\nchallenges of small-arms proliferation. We hope, by\nworking with others in the United Nations, to see the use\nof this terrible weapon come to an end.\nIllegal drug-trafficking also threatens our peoples?\nsecurity. The drug trade affects governance, undermines\nhuman rights and promotes cross-border conflicts. That is\nwhy Canada has proposed a Foreign Ministers? dialogue\ngroup in the Americas. We hope that this will be a forum\nwhich can provide guidance and generate ideas to help us\ncurtail the collateral impact of the drug trade on\nGovernments and on society. These and other emerging\nthreats to our security, including terrorism, crime and\nenvironmental degradation, affect every one of us but are\nbeyond the reach of any of us alone. They demand global,\nintegrated solutions, which the United Nations is best\nsuited to provide. The International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, concluded last year,\nongoing work in developing a convention on transnational\norganized crime and the Kyoto Protocol to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2014 all\nshow that we are capable of working together to enhance\nour human security.\nMoving the human security agenda forward also\nrequires that we redouble efforts to address the root\ncauses of conflict and risk. Peace and stability are\nindispensable to security, but they are not, regrettably,\nhumanity?s birthright. They must be built. Two years ago,\nwe launched the Canadian Peace-building Initiative. Its\nobjective is to address the unique challenges of societies\nrecovering from conflict. Through this initiative, projects\nhave been undertaken in Guatemala to assist civil society\nto implement the peace agreements, in Bosnia to promote\nawareness of the peace accords, in Mozambique to\nsupport a programme to exchange weapons for farming\ntools, and in West Africa to support the initiative led by\nMali to promote a West African arms moratorium. These\nare small steps, certainly, but constructive ones in\nworking locally to build peace.\nToday, I am pleased to release a report entitled\n\u201cPeace in Progress\u201d, which documents the results\nobtained to date and the wide range of partners with\nwhom we have worked. As the title suggests, Canada\nintends to carry on with its partners in empowering those\nworking to build peaceful and stable societies in their\nown countries.\nIt has been a half-century since a distinguished\nCanadian international civil servant, John Humphrey,\nwrote the first draft of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. Since then over 60 international human\nrights instruments have been adopted. Countries have\nshown a new and welcome willingness to cooperate with\nthe international human rights system.\nBut we must build on that progress, and one of the\nmost important ways that the Assembly can make its\ncontribution this year is to support a strong United\nNations declaration on human rights defenders to protect\n24\n\n\nthose who are protecting those whose human rights are\nbeing abused.\n(spoke in French)\nThe growing integration of human rights, including\nwomen?s rights, into all other aspects of United Nations\nactivity is a recent and important breakthrough. On the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the conditions exist to achieve progress in attaining\nthe goals set out by its drafters. This is good news.\nHowever, a review of the human rights situation around the\nglobe makes it painfully clear that we remain far short of\nthese goals.\nWe need to take advantage of the momentum that this\nanniversary presents. The United Nations human rights\nsystem must be assured of both the political support of the\nmembership and increased regular budget financing if it is\nto do the job we have entrusted to it.\n(spoke in English)\nThe growth of intra-State conflicts caused by\ndifferences of religion, language, race or ethnicity has\nreinforced the need to protect marginalized groups. To do\nso, both Governments and civil society must have ready\naccess to information about human rights situations around\nthe world. To this end, Canada has launched for the record\nan annual report drawn from United Nations sources, which\nwe are making available on the Internet to provide constant\nupdated information concerning human rights around the\nglobe.\nCertainly, of those at risk from conflict, none are more\nat risk than children. The targeting of children in\nwarfare \u2014 both as fighters and as victims \u2014 is intolerable.\nThe ground-breaking efforts of Gra\u00e7a Machel and the work\nof the Secretary-General?s Special Representative for\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, merit special\nand ongoing support.\nEnhancing human security also requires establishing\nlegal instruments. The agreement in Rome to establish the\nInternational Criminal Court is a major fundamental step\ntowards that goal. This Court will help to deter some of the\nmost serious violations of international humanitarian law.\nIt will help give new meaning and global reach to\nprotecting the vulnerable and the innocent. By isolating and\nstigmatizing those who commit war crimes or genocide and\nremoving them from the community, it will help end cycles\nof impunity and retribution. Without justice there is no\nreconciliation, and without reconciliation there can be no\npeace.\nWe need to move forward urgently in making the\nCourt a reality. We should begin during this session of\nthe General Assembly to bring the Court into operation.\nWe who have supported the Court should ratify the\nStatute as soon as possible. We must also work to\nunderstand and address the concerns of those States that\nremain hesitant about the Court \u2014 without diluting its\neffectiveness. Ultimately, we must ensure that we have an\ninstitution that will be credible, responsible and effective.\nRespect for civil and political rights is necessary, but\nin itself is not sufficient to create the conditions for stable\nsocieties. Stability also requires economic and social well-\nbeing.\nRegrettably, statistics show that countries with the\nlowest income are much more likely to fall victim to\nviolent conflict than others. The number of people whose\nbasic human needs are not being met remains\nunacceptably and dangerously high. A quarter of the\nworld?s people live in severe poverty; more than 800\nmillion face malnutrition; 180 million children under the\nage of 14 work as child labourers. As the United Nations\nhuman development index makes clear this year, the gap\nbetween the haves and the have-nots continues to grow.\nCountries overburdened by debt are less likely to be\ndeveloped and more likely to succumb to conflict.\nReducing the debt of the least developed nations allows\nthem to devote more resources to basic human needs.\nThat is why at the summit of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) in Ouagadougou I announced a $20 million\ncontribution to the African Development Bank to support\nthe most heavily indebted African countries. That is also\nwhy Canada has forgiven virtually all development-related\ndebt owed to us by the least developed countries \u2014\nalmost $1 billion \u2014 and why we encourage others who\nhave not already done so to do likewise.\nI think we all recognize that globalization presents\nopportunities, but it also exposes all of us, especially the\nmost vulnerable, to greater economic and social\ninsecurity. The international financial turmoil of the past\nmonths vividly demonstrates the impact these crises can\nhave on the daily lives of the least fortunate. It means\nthat we need to be sensitive to the social consequences of\nfinancial volatility. And when crisis strikes, the United\nNations and its specialized agencies have a special\nresponsibility to assist those most severely affected.\n25\n\n\nThere is no greater threat to our security than nuclear\nproliferation. In 1945, Canada, despite the experience of the\nmost destructive war in history, decided to forgo the\nnuclear option even though, as a participant in the\nManhattan Project, we had the technical capability and\nmaterial capacity to build our own nuclear weapons. In\n1968, the Government of Canada confirmed that decision\nand joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT). Every subsequent Canadian Government\nhas reaffirmed that commitment, and we have spent much\ndiplomatic effort to persuade others that nuclear weapons\nare the problem, not the solution.\nThe non-proliferation regime has enhanced everyone?s\nsecurity. The credibility of that regime has been severely\ntested over the years, but particularly over the past six\nmonths. India?s and Pakistan?s nuclear tests put the entire\nnon-proliferation regime in jeopardy. Nuclear testing\nundermines the basic goals and objectives of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty. Testing puts all of us, not least the people of\nthe testing countries themselves, at greater risk. Therefore,\nthere can be no condoning these actions.\nAnd there must be no rewards. We must not legitimize\nthe claims of would-be nuclear Powers, or confer any new\nstatus on proliferators. We listened carefully to the\npresentations of the Presidents of India and of Pakistan this\nweek and we welcome the indications they gave that they\nwould sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nBut it is important to reiterate that Security Council\nresolution 1172 (1998) calls upon India and Pakistan to sign\nthe Treaty without conditions, to participate purposefully in\nthe negotiations on a cut-off treaty on fissile materials, to\nstop the weaponization of their nuclear programmes, to\nimpose strict export controls on nuclear technology and to\nembrace fully the non-proliferation regime. We urge them\nto do so.\nIn that spirit, we welcome India?s and Pakistan?s\ndecision to relaunch their dialogue on Kashmir. We also\nrecognize that preventing horizontal proliferation, while\ncrucial, is no more important than preventing vertical\nproliferation. Nuclear disarmament is the other half of the\nnuclear bargain. That bargain is a balance of responsibilities\nand obligations undertaken by nuclear-weapon and non-\nnuclear-weapon States alike. Not all nuclear-weapon States\nhave begun to fulfil their obligations under Article VI of\nthe Non-proliferation Treaty, and we call upon them to\nfulfil their responsibilities.\nAs we all recognize, this period of globalization\nmultiplies the challenges. It is Canada?s conviction that a\ndynamic, responsive and flexible United Nations system\nis the best way, perhaps the only way, to meet these\nchallenges.\n(spoke in French)\nTo fulfil its leadership responsibilities, the United\nNations must be assured of reliable and adequate funding.\nWe cannot revitalize the United Nations so long as\nMember States, particularly the most wealthy and\nfortunate among them, contribute less to a system from\nwhich they demand more. Renewal can be achieved only\nif Member States pay their assessed dues, present and\npast due, on time and without conditions.\n(spoke in English)\nLet me now speak of the Security Council. The\nSecurity Council remains at the centre of what the United\nNations is all about: protecting against conflict and human\nrisk. However, the Council?s legitimacy is increasingly\nbeing questioned. To remain credible, the Council must\nre-examine traditional interpretations of its mandate. The\nCouncil needs to broaden its horizons in addressing\nemerging threats which impact on our security. Thematic\ndebates on these issues, in which all Member States can\nparticipate, are a good step. The addition of peace-\nbuilding to the Council?s range of responses to threats to\npeace and security is also welcome.\nBut the Council must also be more willing and more\nconsistent in both how and when it becomes involved.\nThe Council belongs to all Member States. It cannot be\nallowed to focus on solving the problems of one region\nand be indifferent to those of others.\nThe way the Council does its work must be more\nopen and more transparent. For example, Member States\ninvolved in and affected by matters before the Council\nmust be allowed to exercise their Charter rights. Far from\nconstraining the Council?s efficiency, this will improve\nthe decisions it takes and render its actions more\neffective. The trend for permanent members increasingly\nto assume more control over the agenda, thereby\nmarginalizing elected members, runs counter to the\ndemocratic principles which so inform our political\ninstitutions at the close of the twentieth century. The\ndistinctions between permanent and elected members need\nto be narrowed rather than widened.\n26\n\n\nIn sum, the Council we need for the next century must\nbe more responsible, more accountable and less\nimpenetrable. We hope that members will support Canada\nin advancing these aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam are\nrecent examples of the death and destruction terrorists\ncontinue to inflict on innocent people.\nFundamental human rights and freedoms are still being\nviolated and the human dignity of individuals is still being\nhumiliated in many countries on all continents.\nThe environment continues to be devastated by many\naspects of humankind?s activity, global warming being one\nof the particularly ominous effects.\nAnd the gap between the rich and the poor is still\nwidening despite many efforts to challenge hunger and\npoverty in the developing world.\nTo address and solve these and other problems,\ninternational cooperation is essential. The traditional\nplatform, the United Nations, remains the most suitable\nfor organizing the global efforts and resources needed for\nthis task. These issues are a tremendous challenge to the\nUnited Nations, and so it is essential that the capabilities\nof the United Nations be fully exploited. The\nOrganization must respond to them with flexibility. It\nmust provide realistic plans and procedures for dealing\nwith problems as they arise. And it must exploit the\npolitical will necessary to implement programmes once\nthey are put in place.\nA country?s international reputation is largely\ndependent on its domestic health. In my country, this\nyear?s parliamentary elections resulted in a change of\nGovernment. I wish to stress that the top foreign policy\npriorities of the Czech Republic \u2014 joining the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European\nUnion \u2014 stem from our desire to actively contribute to\nthe implementation of the vision of a united, democratic,\npeaceful, socially just and prosperous Europe; a Europe\nwithout tensions or conflicts; a Europe of free citizens\nand cooperating regions based on mutual solidarity,\nhuman rights and cooperative security.\nThe Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are\nexpected to join the Alliance in 1999. The integration of\nthese countries, we believe, will justify the enlargement\nof NATO and its contribution to European security. We\nare keenly aware of our shared responsibility in this\nmatter. We expect NATO?s door to remain open for other\ncountries to join when they are ready. The Alliance?s\npresent role is not limited to safeguarding the vital\ninterests of its members by means of collective defence.\nOver time it has made a contribution to global and pan-\nEuropean security. We are sure that, in close collaboration\nwith other European security institutions \u2014 such as the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the Western European Union and the Council of\nEurope \u2014 NATO will be able to lay foundations for a\nfuture all-European security.\nPreparing for the next round of enlargement of the\nEuropean Union, an integration which is unique in the\nworld, is a task for all Europeans. By opening up\nmembership to Central and East European countries last\nyear in Luxembourg, the Union has finally overcome the\nheritage of a divided continent. We hope the enlargement\nprocess will maintain the present momentum and that it\nwill not be hampered by criteria other than the readiness\nof each candidate country.\n29\n\n\nEurope has been a contributor to global security.\nHowever, it still has to put its own house in order. One of\nthe most complicated European security problems is\nmanaging the consequences of the division of the former\nYugoslavia and, in particular, the restoration of a self-\nsustained peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a settlement\nof the situation in Kosovo in the former Republic of\nYugoslavia. We fully endorse the implementation of the\nDayton Peace Agreement and believe no better solution is\navailable. The military objectives of the Peace Agreement\nhave practically been met \u2014 that is undeniably one of the\ngreat successes of the implementation of Dayton. Further\nprogress on the civilian side, however, continues to depend\non a substantial international presence in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, which has to be maintained until the desirable\nend-state is achieved. That is why the Czech Republic\ncontinues to participate in the international Stabilization\nForce (SFOR) spending national resources both on its\nmilitary contingent in SFOR and on the reconstruction of\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo\ndue to the ongoing conflict has to be addressed as a matter\nof urgency. Belgrade must be strongly reminded that it has\ncrossed the limits of what is tolerable and legitimate. We\nwelcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1199\n(1998), adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter just a few\nhours ago. In our view, this resolution usefully foreshadows\nthe necessary steps for the international community.\nThe Czech Republic has traditionally paid great\nattention to the Middle East peace process, and we are\nconcerned to see that little progress has been made. In our\nview, a positive future for this region can only be secured\nby successfully completing the peace process, and we\nbelieve the process can soon be revitalized.\nThe Czech Republic also supports the endeavour of\nthe international community to solve the problem of\nCyprus. The current status quo is unacceptable. We hope\nthat Cyprus will be united as a federation in accordance\nwith the appropriate United Nations resolutions.\nWe are deeply concerned to see the deterioration of\nsecurity and the humanitarian situation in a number of\nAfrican countries, including in the region of the Great\nLakes, in Sudan and elsewhere. We fully support the efforts\nof the United Nations and its work with the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) to settle conflicts and stop the human\nsuffering in Africa. Positive developments we can now\nobserve include an improving situation in Sierra Leone,\nwhich is a source of our optimism on the issue of Africa.\nWe are ready to assist the various processes at work in\nAfrica, including the dispatching of observers to\nrespective United Nations peacekeeping operations, and in\nthe development of cooperation.\nRecent problems in Asia have already been\nmentioned. Here we are concerned not only with the\ncontinuing regional economic and financial crisis and the\nnuclear tests, but also with enormous natural disasters\ntaking thousands of lives and causing enormous material\nand environmental damage.\nThe scourge of international terrorism must be\ncountered vigorously, and in cooperation among all of us,\nas President Clinton eloquently appealed for at this forum\ntwo days ago. This task is high on the agenda of many,\nand we believe the United Nations, as the global platform,\nshould assert its responsibilities. We endorse all initiatives\naimed at cutting terrorists off from any support and\nresources, isolating them and strictly punishing them.\nBeing a small country, the Czech Republic is\nnaturally interested in all international efforts aimed at\nprevention and resolution of armed conflicts. We support\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and all efforts to\nmake them more effective. I would like to reiterate that\nmy country is committed to contributing further to United\nNations peacekeeping operations, refining its own forces\nto meet the new requirements. Let me point out the\nincreasing number of attacks against the personnel\nparticipating in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations,\nand join the call for strict punishment of the perpetrators\nof these shameful acts.\nWe support nuclear disarmament and we look\nforward to the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals.\nThis is why we regard the nuclear tests carried out in\nMay 1998 by countries considered non-nuclear-weapon\nStates as clearly negative steps. Universal compliance\nwith the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) is a logical step on the way towards\nnuclear disarmament, as is speedy enactment of the\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). On the other\nhand, the progress made in the Geneva Conference on\nDisarmament towards a fissile material cut-off treaty is\nencouraging.\nThe Czech Republic appreciates the work of the\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in\nthe area of chemical disarmament. We are prepared to\ncontinue contributing to the work of the Organization and\nto strictly implement all its commitments arising out of\n30\n\n\nthe respective Convention. At the same time, we support all\nefforts meant to speed up the negotiation of the verification\nprotocol text, which is to strengthen the Biological\nWeapons Convention (BWC); we regard the protocol as an\nimportant mechanism controlling implementation of the\nConvention.\nThe signing of the Ottawa Convention on the complete\nban on anti-personnel landmines by about 100 Member\nStates, including the Czech Republic, has been a great\nsuccess. Now early entry into force has been ensured.\nImplementation, however, will be an even bigger task for\nall. While preparing for the ratification of the Ottawa\nConvention, we have a clear view of its domestic\nimplementation.\nIt is the Security Council that continues to have the\ndecisive word in questions of peace and security. The\nCzech Republic considers itself among the reform-minded\ncountries, supporting the Council?s enlargement, in both\ncategories of membership, which guarantees equitable\ngeographic representation. To be more specific, we continue\nsupporting the aspirations of the Federal Republic of\nGermany and Japan in this respect.\nIt is rather disappointing that after five years of the\nWorking Group?s dealing with this issue concrete results\nhave not been achieved. On the contrary, it seems that\nMember States are even further apart on the issue.\nUnfortunately, the same applies to the question of\nimproving and simplifying the methods of the Council?s\nwork, on which consensus seemed to be near a year ago.\nIt is our view that the Working Group should continue\nits work with the aim of achieving general agreement, to\nthe extent possible, until the end of the millennium. We\nhope that talks will eventually produce concrete results that\ncould be put on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly within the Millennium Assembly\nconcept.\nThe new Government of the Czech Republic attaches\ngreat importance to the issue of human rights. This\nDecember we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a\ndocument substantially influencing the international\ncommunity and international relations.\nThe record of these 50 years is no doubt impressive,\nbut there is still a long way to go to achieve the desired\nuniversal acceptance and indivisibility of human rights. This\nsad situation can be illustrated by the fact that there are still\ncountries governed by totalitarian regimes where people\nare punished for such absurd \u201ccrimes\u201d as distributing the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights or for refusing to\nexplain where they obtained such a \u201csubversive\ndocument\u201d. However, it has to be admitted that economic\nsanctions or embargoes do not seem to be effective means\nof persuading a country to promote human rights.\nThe successful conclusion of the Diplomatic\nConference in Rome last July, which resulted in the\nshaping of the International Criminal Court, fills us with\nhope. The adoption of the Court?s Statute is a clear\nbreakthrough in the area of humanitarian law and human\nrights protection. We are aware that this is only an initial\nstage of the long process leading to a functioning Court,\nbut the step taken in Rome was crucial. I would like to\nexpress our gratitude to the Government of Italy for its\nsubstantial contribution to the success of the Conference.\nCooperation in the social, economic and\nhumanitarian areas should undoubtedly be, in addition to\nbuilding peace and security, major preoccupations of the\nUnited Nations. Over the last few years there have been\nstrong discussions on the Economic and Social Council\nand its function. The Czech Republic was actively\ninvolved during its Council presidency in 1997. The\nchallenge for the Council, stemming from globalization of\neconomic and other links, was enormous. On the other\nhand, the actual possibilities of this body to tackle\nsubstantial issues were rather limited. But now we are\npleased to see it undergoing some promising changes.\nThe Czech Republic appreciates the attention paid by\nthe United Nations to the critical issue of globalization\nand its impact on economic and social development in the\ndifferent countries of the world. For many, like my\ncountry, whose economies are undergoing a fundamental\ntransformation, the consequences of globalization are\ndoubly difficult to handle. That is why we would like the\nUnited Nations to have a clear agenda on globalization,\nand we are encouraged by the lead provided by the\nSecretary-General.\nThe new Government of the Czech Republic has\npromised in its Programme Statement wide support for\nthe strengthening of United Nations authority. We have\nwelcomed the results so far achieved in implementing the\nSecretary-General?s plan for United Nations reform. Much\nof the reform package, however, remains unresolved, and\na number of proposals have not left the negotiating table.\nThe Czech Republic supports speedy approval and\nimplementation of the remaining reform proposals.\n31\n\n\nHowever, even the best blueprints do not count for much\nwithout money to implement them. Like others, I want to\nstress that the financial situation of the Organization is\nalarming, and I would like to underline that discipline with\nregard to contributing is a must for all.\nWe look with expectations to the proposed Millennium\nAssembly to be held in the year 2000, inspired, among\nothers, by Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel. The Millennium\nSummit held within its framework could then focus on the\nchallenges the United Nations will be facing in the next\nmillennium and identify major trends and objectives of\nfuture United Nations activities. In addition, an important\nrole could be played by a related non-governmental\n\u201cMillennium Forum\u201d. The Czech Republic?s special\ncontribution to such a debate can be \u201cFORUM 2000\u201d, a\nconference taking place in Prague next month aimed at\nhighlighting global problems that humankind faces at the\nthreshold of the twenty-first century.\nIn conclusion, allow me to express my sincere belief\nin the eventual success of the United Nations reform\nprocess. I think we can all agree that from this process the\nUnited Nations, a truly remarkable Organization, will\nemerge consolidated, strengthened and more capable than\never of solving the problems of the contemporary world \u2014\nan Organization open to all who are willing to contribute to\nthe fulfilment of this important task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a true pleasure for me to address the General\nAssembly once more. I wish first of all to echo previous\nspeakers in congratulating you most warmly, Sir, on behalf\nof my delegation, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I take this\nopportunity also to express our gratitude to His Excellency\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the excellent work carried out\nunder his presidency.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we\nreaffirm our confidence in his outstanding endeavours to\npreserve peace and to promote development.\nTo all participants in the fifty-third session, I wish the\ngreatest success in the interests of all our peoples.\nTen days ago hurricane Georges passed through the\nCaribbean region, striking several of our countries with its\nfury and leaving considerable damage in its wake. I wish to\nexpress deepest sympathy, on behalf of Haiti, to our\nbrotherly Governments and peoples who, like us, were so\nhard hit by this unavoidable disaster.\nThe provisional toll in Haiti is quite heavy: 150 dead\nand dozens missing \u2014 more than 500,000 victims all told.\nThere was considerable material damage to agriculture and\nto infrastructure: roads and bridges were destroyed and\ncrops devastated in several regions. The total cost of these\nlosses is estimated at approximately $200 million.\nInternational solidarity was quickly displayed in the\nwake of this disaster. I would therefore like to thank all the\nfriendly Governments, international institutions and non-\ngovernmental organizations for the support they have given\nus thus far.\nWhile the present situation is serious, our concern for\nthe future is even greater. With over 60 per cent of our\nagricultural production destroyed, the outlook is extremely\nbleak. We fear that once emergency aid is no longer being\nprovided in the coming months there will be a severe\nshortage of foodstuffs and basic goods. We therefore appeal\nto the international community to extend considerable\nassistance to our efforts to restore and rebuild the affected\nzones and to support our measures to solve the public\nhealth problems that will arise. In this regard, we invite\ndelegations to support draft resolution A/53/L.2/Rev.1,\nwhich will soon be introduced to the General Assembly,\nas a first step in this direction.\nProfound changes have taken place in international\nrelations in the course of the last 10 years. The lessening\nof ideological confrontation and the strengthening of\ninterdependence among nations have provided new\nopportunities for closer cooperation among States. The\nphenomenon of globalization, which is characterized by\nunprecedented ties between human activities throughout\nthe world, has expanded further and has been propelled\nby spectacular growth in communications.\nSome had anticipated a more peaceful and united\nworld in the next century. Yet, less than 500 days away\nfrom the year 2000, the international picture is frankly\ndisconcerting. New hotbeds of tension have arisen in\nmany regions of the world, while no substantial progress\nhas been made to resolve various age-old conflicts. That\nis the case in the Middle East, where we hope that the\nrecent discussions held this week in Washington will\nserve to permanently revive the peace process that has\nbeen stalled for more than a year.\nWe deplore the armed conflicts that have brought\nuntold suffering on populations, be it in Kosovo, Angola,\nAfghanistan, the Great Lakes region or elsewhere. The\nRepublic of Haiti invites the parties concerned to seek a\nsolution to their problems through dialogue. The\ninternational community must also continue to carry out\nefforts to restore peace to these regions.\nInternational terrorism, of which we had hoped to\nhave seen the last, has re-emerged in a troubling fashion\nwith the terrible events that have taken place in Africa\nand Northern Ireland. In condemning these acts, Haiti\ncalls on the international community to adopt effective\nmeasures to combat this threat to international security.\nElsewhere, the world is facing a real challenge\nwhose consequences are incalculable on more than one\nfront. I am referring to drug-trafficking and its related\ncrimes \u2014 arms-trafficking, organized crime and money-\nlaundering.\nThe problem of drug-trafficking continues to threaten\nthe integrity of our territories, to weaken the foundations\nof our societies and to undermine the health of our\npeoples. Combating this scourge requires further\ncooperation at the bilateral, regional and international\nlevels, as was highlighted at the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the drugs problem. Haiti,\n8\n\n\nwhich has unfortunately been used as a transit country for\nsome of the drugs headed for markets in consumer\ncountries, has adopted a vigorous policy that has already\nbegun to bear fruit. This involves the drafting of legislative\nmeasures against drug-trafficking and money-laundering;\nthe establishment of a body entrusted with combating\ntrafficking in narcotic drugs; the development of\ncooperation with neighbouring countries; and accession to\ninternational instruments in this area.\nIn speaking of the dangers threatening the future of\nmankind, I must refer here to the existence of considerable\nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, in particular\nnuclear weapons. The Republic of Haiti welcomes the\nrecent progress achieved in the reduction of these weapons.\nIt will continue to support wholeheartedly the efforts of the\ninternational community for their complete elimination.\nIn this connection, Haiti deplored the nuclear tests\nrecently carried out by India and Pakistan, which have\ncontributed to increasing tensions in that part of the world.\nIt invites those countries to become parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to sign the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nThe global economic situation at the end of this\ncentury has also given rise to many concerns. The\nphenomenon of globalization, which is characterized by a\nliberalization of market forces, which, according to\nnumerous observers, should accelerate growth and promote\ndevelopment, has above all been marked by greater\ninequality and sluggish growth. The income gap between\nNorth and South has continued to widen. In 1965 the\naverage per capita income in the G-7 countries was 20\ntimes that of the world\u2019s seven poorest countries; by 1995\nthat figure had almost doubled.\nToday poverty continues to grow throughout the\nworld. Entire populations are victims of the serious\nproblems of malnutrition and abject poverty. Health care\nand education are inaccessible to millions of people. There\nhas been further destruction of the environment throughout\nthe world, threatening the very survival of mankind. Even\nmore than the countries of the third world, which have been\nbattered by these global developments, the least developed\ncountries \u2014 including my country, Haiti \u2014 find themselves\never more marginalized and must face a worsening of the\nstandard of living of their peoples. The feeling of despair\nis increasingly spreading among younger generations facing\na seemingly gloomy future. All of this poses serious threats\nto the very stability of our countries. This situation cries out\nfor the international community to redouble its efforts to\ncombat poverty. United and concerted long-term action\nthat mobilizes considerable resources is essential if we\nwish to achieve satisfactory results.\nThe magnitude of current problems poses a major\nchallenge to the international community. The United\nNations, whose primary mission is to ensure world\nsecurity and to promote economic and social progress for\npeople, is the ideal forum to discuss these questions and\nto search for solutions that take everyone\u2019s interests into\naccount. It must be able to play the role that has been\nentrusted to it in order to create a global situation of\npeace, which will facilitate development through\ncooperation for all peoples. It must respond to this\nchallenge by using its resources effectively and by\nadapting itself to changes in international relations.\nIn this regard, the delegation of Haiti welcomes the\nreform process initiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nto breathe new life into the Organization and to better\nenable it to face the increasingly complex problems of\ntoday\u2019s world. The initial measures approved by the\nGeneral Assembly have enabled United Nations bodies to\nwork more coherently and consistently. We hope that\nfurther measures to be considered at this session will\nstrengthen the capacities of the United Nations to carry\nout its activities.\nReform in the Security Council, which has been\ndiscussed for five years now, is of capital importance\ngiven the role played by that organ in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Haiti continues to call for\ngreater openness in the functioning of the Council and for\ngreater participation in the decision-making process, so\nthat its decisions reflect the general opinion of the\ninternational community as a whole and not only the\nposition of the members of the Council.\nIn this context, the envisaged increase in its\nmembership must take into account more systematically\nthe principle of equitable geographical distribution. Every\neffort must be made to ensure that the universality of all\nthe planet\u2019s inhabitants is reflected in the United Nations\nsystem.\nIn this respect, we welcome the dialogue between\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan. A positive\noutcome to this dialogue will allow for progress in this\narea.\nThis year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human\n9\n\n\nRights. By enshrining the principle of the respect of\nfundamental human rights and by ensuring their promotion,\nthe United Nations has made a considerable contribution to\nthe development of an international system to protect the\nfundamental freedoms and ensure the emancipation of\npeoples throughout the world.\nAlong these lines, my delegation welcomes the fact\nthat the international community has finally acknowledged\nthat the right to development is an intrinsic part of\nfundamental human rights. But that acknowledgment is not\nsufficient. We must work to ensure full respect for that\nright by establishing programmes and by mobilizing\nsufficient resources.\nToday human rights are a reality that no Government\ncan ignore. In Haiti respect for human rights is guaranteed\nin the Constitution, and the Government is committed to\nensuring the full enjoyment of those rights by all. In this\ncontext, reform in the judicial machinery that will allow for\nthe consolidation of the state of law is now being\nimplemented. Regrettably, however, the very complex\nsituation resulting from a twofold electoral and\ngovernmental problem has made it difficult for institutions\nto function normally and to cooperate with the international\ncommunity. To overcome this handicap, the President of\nthe Republic, Mr. Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, is resolutely undertaking\nevery possible effort.\nDemocratic institutions necessarily have a role to play,\nbut given the regrettably slow process of democracy-\nbuilding, the hoped-for results have not yet been achieved\ndespite the numerous initiatives undertaken. It is\nencouraging to note, however, that these expectations and\ninitiatives have been undertaken within the framework of\nthe provisions of the Constitution, which guarantees that a\nviable solution will be found.\nSimilarly, the head of State has consulted all levels of\nHaitian society in order to set up a new electoral council\nthat will be responsible for organizing, in accordance with\nthe Constitution and as soon as possible, free, fair and\ndemocratic elections at the municipal and legislative levels.\nHe will do everything in his power to guarantee the\nparticipation of all sectors in these elections, which, duly\ncarried out, will help us overcome the governmental crisis\nthat has arisen.\nDespite the unfavourable circumstances that have\ndarkened the horizon at the dawning of the third\nmillennium, we must not lose hope in a better world. In\norder to do that, we must further develop cooperation,\nstrengthen our partnerships and work together to improve\nour peoples\u2019 standard of living in a world where so many\nnatural disasters and environmental phenomena remind us\nof our duty to solidarity. The United Nations is the ideal\nframework for joining our efforts to achieve this common\ngoal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, on behalf of my country?s\ndelegation, to convey to Mr. Opertti my warm\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am\nconvinced that his wisdom and experience will ensure that\nwe are successful in our work. I wish also to thank his\npredecessor, Mr. Udovenko, who guided the work of the\nlast session so skilfully.\nI wish also to extend our appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, for his constant and tireless efforts to\nstrengthen the universality of the United Nations, to\nenhance its credibility and to strengthen its ability to\ndischarge its responsibilities despite a difficult\ninternational situation.\nOn 16 July of last year, the Secretary-General\npresented to the Assembly his report entitled \u201cRenewing\nthe United Nations: a Programme for Reform\u201d\n(A/51/950), which provides an overall scheme to\n14\n\n\nmodernize the working methods of the Organization in\norder to give it fresh impetus and enhance its efficiency so\nthat it is better capable of responding optimally to the\ngrowing needs of the international community on the\nthreshold of the third millennium.\nIn this regard, we are convinced that implementation\nof the measures to reform the Organization will assist it in\nachieving its aims and objectives, namely restoring peace\nand security to the world and strengthening international\ncooperation in such a way as to achieve the economic and\nsocial development of all nations and peoples. In line with\nthis, the question of reform and expansion of the United\nNations Security Council has, for several years, been\ndiscussed. In this connection, we would like to reiterate our\nsupport for the proposals aiming at enlarging the\nrepresentative base of that key body in accordance with the\nnorms of democracy, transparency and justice and with\nequitable geographical distribution, enabling it to reflect the\nuniversal nature of our Organization pursuant to Article 24\nof the Charter.\nThe threats facing today?s world are not all political or\nmilitary in nature. Some of them are economic or social\nand call for prompt and practical solution. The scourge of\ndrugs and psychotropic substances and the ravages resulting\nfrom their consumption, marketing and distribution are\namong the most serious challenges facing us today. In this\nconnection, I wish to express my delegation?s satisfaction\nthat awareness of the dangers inherent in this evil is\nsteadily growing. This has been reflected in a very clear-cut\nfashion in the unanimous adoption, at the twentieth special\nsession of the General Assembly held last June, of the\nPolitical Declaration and the Guiding Principles of Drug\nDemand Reduction.\nThere is no doubt that international peace and security\non the one hand and economic growth, social development\nand the eradication of poverty on the other are organically\nbound up one with another. The United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies have provided many measures to\nimpress this reality on all of us. This approach has been\nmanifested in the adoption of a large number of\nprogrammes and recommendations stemming from\nimportant international conferences and forums organized\nin the last few years under the auspices of the United\nNations.\nHowever, this enormous effort should be translated\ninto concrete reality through a new mobilization based on\npartnership and solidarity. The first step should be to devote\nto these lofty objectives the tremendous resources allocated\nto the production, development and acquisition of all\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction.\nOn this basis, we must likewise enable the\ndeveloping countries to speed up effectively their pace of\ngrowth. To this end, donor countries should augment their\nofficial development assistance, increase flows of\ninvestments, put an end to the continuous deterioration in\nterms of commercial trade, and give the products of\ndeveloping countries free access to their markets without\nany hindrance.\nLikewise, the debt problem, which constitutes a\nheavy burden for the economies of developing countries,\nshould receive the attention that it deserves. The 1997\nHuman Development Report indicates that debt servicing\non average absorbs a fifth of a developing country?s\nexport earnings, which is a significant drain on its modest\nforeign currency reserves and thus compromises its ability\nto take part in international trade on an equal footing.\nIn this context, we hope that the initiatives taken on\nthe subject of the external debt of the poorest and most\nheavily indebted countries will make it possible to find a\nradical solution to this set of problems, which impedes\nthese countries? development endeavours.\nDespite the magnitude of the challenges of\ndevelopment and the wide range of priorities involved,\nand despite an unfavourable world economic situation, the\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania, under the enlightened\nleadership of the President of the Republic, Mr. Maaouya\nOuld Sid?Ahmed Taya, has taken significant steps\ntowards comprehensive development aimed at raising our\ncitizens? standard of living and at consolidating\ndemocracy and the rule of law in a climate of tranquillity,\nsecurity and stability.\nOn the political plane, therefore, pluralistic\ndemocracy in our country came to fruition with the\nholding on 12 December 1997 of pluralistic presidential\nelections, the second of their kind, in which several\ncandidates participated in a spirit of healthy competition\nand a climate of political plurality and freedom of\nexpression. Furthermore, the third municipal elections,\nscheduled for the end of this year, are being organized\nsuccessfully.\nAlongside this democratic process, which embodies\nour people?s aspirations to fully exercise its rights, our\ncountry is engaged in a decisive struggle to eradicate\npoverty and to combat illiteracy and marginalization, for\n15\n\n\nwe are convinced that genuine enjoyment of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms cannot be fully achieved except\nthrough a sustained effort aimed at enhancing citizens?\nsocio-economic and cultural level.\nWe have created an agency to deal with human rights,\npoverty and integration. That agency is responsible for\npromoting the exercise of human rights and implementing\nthe national strategy to combat poverty. The budgetary\nallocations earmarked for social expenditure are\napproximately 37 per cent of all public expenditure \u2014\nalmost double the level recommended by the World\nSummit for Social Development.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania is pursuing a\nforeign policy that is based on immutable principles aimed\nat fostering relations of good-neighbourliness, peaceful\ncoexistence and strengthened regional and international\ncooperation. On the basis of these principles, my country\nattaches particular importance to the consolidation of\nstability and the containment of the large number of areas\nof tension around the world that are likely to threaten\ninternational peace and security and to jeopardize the\ndevelopment efforts of many nations and peoples.\nWhile reaffirming its full support for the peace process\nin the Middle East, my country believes that no just and\nlasting peace can be achieved in that region until Israel has\nwithdrawn from all the occupied Palestinian territories,\nincluding Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan and the Lebanese\nterritories, in conformity with Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the principle of\nland for peace. Such a peace cannot be attained until the\nPalestinian people have been enabled to establish their\nindependent state on their territory with Al-Quds as its\ncapital.\nIn this respect, my country expresses its profound\nconcern at the difficulties besetting the peace process and\nthe negative developments that have taken place in the\nregion. My country also calls for taking the measures\nnecessary for restarting peace negotiations on all tracks, and\nurges the two sponsors of the peace process to make further\nefforts to preserve the chances for peace in that region.\nWith respect to the Gulf region, we hope that all\nregional and international efforts will combine to bring\nabout a return to stability and concord in the area. In this\nrespect my country, while reaffirming its attachment and\ncommitment to international legitimacy and United Nations\nresolutions, reiterates its repudiation of anything that could\nundermine the independence of Kuwait and its territorial\nintegrity.\nIt also reaffirms its consistent position of rejecting\nany measure likely to threaten the unity of Iraq and the\nintegrity of its territory. At the same time, it calls for the\nlifting of the embargo imposed for seven years now on\nthe Iraqi people. The Iraqis have been very hard hit by\nthis embargo, whose impact has been first and foremost\nfelt by women, children and the elderly.\nWith respect to the Arab Maghreb, my country is\nacting, together with its sister countries of the Arab\nMaghreb Union, to develop cooperation and consultation,\nto respond to the aspirations of the peoples of the\nMaghreb.\nAs to Western Sahara, my country expresses its\nsatisfaction at the positive steps taken within the\nframework of the United Nations settlement plan and\nreiterates its readiness to do its utmost to facilitate its\nimplementation.\nWe call for the lifting of the embargo imposed on\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We hope that the recent\npositive developments will lead to finding a formula for\na prompt settlement of this question, which has harmed\nthe interests of the Libyan people.\nIn many parts of Africa, the situation remains\nworrisome because of conflicts and civil wars, with the\nattendant torrent of human suffering and destruction.\nThese crises, along with other crises around the world,\nshould be given more sustained attention by the United\nNations, since it is the international community that bears\nresponsibility for containing them and for acting seriously\nand effectively to prevent their proliferation. My\ndelegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General\non the causes of conflict in Africa and on ways of\npromoting durable peace and sustainable development.\nWe also welcome Security Council resolution 1170\n(1998), adopted last May, which authorizes a number of\nmechanisms for the implementation of the\nrecommendations contained in that report. We hope too\nthat at its present session the General Assembly, when\nconsidering that report, will find ways and means of\nimplementing the recommendations that fall within its\npurview.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania expresses its\nconcern at the persistent conflict in Somalia and hopes\nthat the Somalis will be able to find the path to\n16\n\n\nconstructive dialogue, in order to bring about a settlement\nthat will secure concord and stability in that country.\nIn the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, we\nhope that the efforts undertaken by the League of Arab\nStates and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) will\nlead to a solution that will preserve that country?s\nsovereignty and unity.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, my country welcomes the truce\nagreement signed last 26 August and supports all the efforts\nand initiatives aimed at restoring security and stability.\nSimilarly, my country urges Ethiopia and Eritrea to\ncontinue to comply with the ceasefire, in the hope that the\nefforts undertaken by the OAU will result in a fair\nsettlement which will guarantee security and stability in the\nregion.\nWith respect to the Great Lakes region and the serious\ndevelopments taking place there, my country supports all\nendeavours to promote a return to stability and to bring\nabout the reconstruction of everything that has been\ndestroyed by war and conflict there.\nLikewise, my country supports the regional and\ninternational endeavours to consolidate peace in Sierra\nLeone, so that that country may see the beginning of a new\nera of peace, stability, reconstruction and development.\nIt is regrettable that there are many other regions of\nthe world where there is instability and conflict. In the\nBalkan region, the situation in Kosovo continues to worsen,\ncompounding the suffering of the population and boding ill\nwith regard to future humanitarian disasters comparable to\nthose experienced in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. This calls for decisive international\nintervention to prevent the situation from worsening further.\nWhile war and conflict cause mass tragedies and mass\ndestruction, the international community today is facing the\nphenomenon of terrorism, which cannot be contained within\neither time or place and which also threatens the peace and\nstability of all States and peoples. My country stresses its\ncondemnation of terrorism in all of its forms, whatever its\norigins. We call for strengthening of cooperation and\nconsultation at the international level in order to confront it\nresolutely and severely.\nThe world of today witnesses a gigantic leap in the\nincrease of wealth, improvement of means of production,\nevolution of telecommunications and the informatics\nrevolution. Although the developments offer conditions of\ncomfort and well-being, they do, however, widen the\nchasm which separates the development and growth levels\nof the developed and the developing countries. This will\nexist as long as cooperation, solidarity and partnership do\nnot prevail, until nations and peoples can together benefit\nfrom the advantages of globalization, and until the\ninternational community is able to give an impetus to\ninternational relations based on peace, democracy, justice\nand sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first, Mr. President, to offer you my sincerest\ncongratulations on your appointment, and to express my\nsatisfaction that the work of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session will be led by such a distinguished\nrepresentative of a country with which Spain has excellent\nrelations. I should also like to thank Minister Udovenko for\nthe efficiency with which he presided over the General\nAssembly during the previous session.\nThe Foreign Minister of Austria has already set out\nthe main elements of the European Union?s position in the\nUnited Nations. For my part, I should like to highlight\ncertain issues of particular interest to Spain.\nIt can generally be said that our Organization is today\nin a stronger position than in previous years, which were\ncharacterized by a predominant feeling of crisis. The major\nreforms undertaken will enable the United Nations to\ncontinue to be the main forum for international cooperation.\nDialogue, the promotion of respect for human rights and the\ndevelopment of international life will continue under the\nauspices of the United Nations. Furthermore, the\nOrganization has consolidated its primary function of\nmaintaining international peace and security.\nAn essential element of the strengthening process that\nthe United Nations is currently undergoing is greater\nrecognition of the limits that restrict its action. The process\nof reforming the Organization, which the Secretary-General\nhas set in motion with decisiveness and determination, has\ncontributed significantly to a sense of getting the\nOrganization under control and of renewed confidence in its\npossibilities. Spain will follow this process very closely so\nas to support it and ensure that it is brought to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nThe debate on enlarging the membership of the\nSecurity Council deserves separate consideration. The\ndifficulties posed by enlarging the permanent membership\nhave been confirmed as negotiations have proceeded. We\nmust not attempt to force decisions that might create\ndivisions within certain regional groups. Reform must\nreflect, as far as possible, general agreement between the\nMembers of the Organization, and in any case it must\nrespect the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter. We\nmust therefore acknowledge that at present there is no\nrealistic alternative to increasing only the number of non-\npermanent members.\nIn order for our Organization to be able to perform\nsatisfactorily its indispensable work, it must be endowed\nwith sufficient funds. The Secretary-General is carrying\nout a major reform designed to ensure, among other aims,\nbetter use of the financial means made available to it by\nStates. However, the current financial situation is very\nworrying, largely owing to the accumulation of arrears.\nNo State should forget that full and timely payment of its\ncontributions is a legally binding international obligation.\nIn 1999, my country will become the eighth largest\ncontributor to the Organization?s budget. We are fully\naware of the responsibility this entails and are ready to\nassume it.\nWith the International Decade for the Eradication of\nColonialism about to end, I believe it is important to\nrecall that the historic work carried out by the\nOrganization in this field cannot be considered complete\nas long as there remain colonial situations such as the one\nwhich so painfully affects my country. I am referring, of\ncourse, to the question of Gibraltar.\nEvery year the General Assembly renews its appeals\nto Spain and the United Kingdom to continue their\nnegotiations with a view to putting an end to the colonial\nsituation of Gibraltar. The current negotiation process\nstems from the so-called Brussels declaration of 1984, in\nwhich the Governments of our two States undertook to\nestablish a negotiation process, to include sovereignty\nissues, in order to settle all their differences. During the\n1997 negotiating round I submitted a proposal that would\nallow Spain to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar, while\nmaintaining for the inhabitants of the Territory all their\ncurrent benefits, granting them, in the framework of the\nSpanish State, a greater degree of political autonomy than\nthey enjoy today, and agreeing, as an additional guarantee\n26\n\n\nof Spain?s good faith, to share sovereignty with the United\nKingdom for a long transition period.\nI believe that that proposal should be able to form the\nbasis of an agreement that would, once and for all, put an\nend to an anachronistic situation originating from the\ndynastic wars of the early eighteenth century.\nRespect for human rights is essential in guaranteeing\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. Our\nOrganization also plays a prominent role in this field.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nshould provide a powerful incentive to continue to develop\ninternational instruments for protecting human rights. The\nadoption of the statute of the International Criminal Court\nduring the recent Rome Conference marked a very\nsignificant step in that direction. Spain firmly supported the\nadoption of the statute, signed it on the first day, and is\nprepared to carry out any actions needed to ensure its\nprompt entry into force.\nLikewise, I wish to back the important work\nperformed by the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, and to underline the importance that my\ncountry attaches to the work of the Commission on Human\nRights, to which it has presented its candidature for the\nperiod 2000 to 2002.\nTerrorism constitutes a serious threat to domestic and\ninternational security, to the development and functioning\nof democratic institutions throughout the world and to the\nexercise of human rights. Spain firmly believes in\nstrengthening the machinery of international cooperation,\nfor which the United Nations is a key forum. Spain, which\nhas ratified all conventions adopted on this issue, has\nalready signed the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and hopes that, as the\nnext step, a convention for the suppression of acts of\nnuclear terrorism can be adopted.\nSimilarly, Spain gives high priority to the international\nfight against drugs. This was evidenced by the Spanish\nPrime Minister?s attendance at the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in June, which was devoted to this\nuniversal problem and which contributed substantially to\nreaffirming our conviction that it is critical to consolidate\ninternational coordination in seeking global solutions based\non the principles of shared responsibility, attention to\nsustainable development and boosting regional and\ninterregional cooperation.\nMultilateral development cooperation and poverty\neradication are crucial to the establishment of peaceful\ninternational coexistence based on respect for human\nrights. Spain is following with attention the\nimplementation of the reform measures proposed by the\nSecretary-General. My Government praises the\nmomentum the Secretary-General is giving to the reform\nof the environmental and human settlement sectors\ndirectly linked to development. My country is\nparticipating in studying new financing formulas to\nprovide sufficient resources for development cooperation.\nIn this regard, without losing sight of the unavoidable\ndebate on budgetary matters, Spain will consider a\npossible gradual increase in its voluntary contributions\nover the next few years.\nOn the subject of disarmament, Spain will shortly\nratify the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction; it is pleased\nwith the swift pace of ratification of the Convention. It is\nlikewise of the utmost importance that next year we\nshould succeed in concluding negotiations on a protocol\non verification of biological weapons.\nAs regards nuclear weapons, I cannot but express\nonce again my concern at the nuclear tests conducted by\nIndia and Pakistan, which go against the international\ncommunity?s efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.\nNevertheless, we are optimistic about the forthcoming\ncommencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the\nproduction of fissile materials for the manufacture of\nnuclear weapons. Finally, we are confident that this\nprogress can be further enhanced by India?s and\nPakistan?s accession to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty.\nThe chief aim of our Organization continues to be\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. Here\nthe United Nations increasingly uses the means that\nregional organizations or groups of States place at its\ndisposal. As a result, its response to various crises is\nbecoming more flexible and the legitimizing role of the\nUnited Nations now carries more weight. Some good\nexamples, in addition to the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\nand Operation Alba \u2014 to cite two cases in which Spain\nrespectively continues to play and played a particularly\nprominent role \u2014 are initiatives such as the Stand-by\nForces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG), which can\n27\n\n\nspeed up United Nations intervention considerably, and in\nwhich Spain is also beginning to participate. Moreover, the\nmediation capacity of the Secretary-General and his\nrepresentatives has been enhanced even further over the\npast year.\nIn this connection, I wish to reaffirm my country?s\ncommitment to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, in the service of which 2,000 Spaniards are\ncurrently serving. Indeed, in addition to participating in\nSFOR, the International Police Task Force (IPTF) and the\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\n(MINUGUA), Spain this year sent a police contingent to\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA).\nFurthermore, Spain intends to sign soon a memorandum of\nunderstanding with the Secretariat to define the modalities\nfor making stand-by forces available to the Organization.\nHumanitarian assistance operations have come to play\nan increasingly important role. Aid workers from many\ncountries, including Spain, have lost their lives in these\nmissions. For this reason, my country will continue to\npromote all measures that can help improve the security\nand safety of personnel providing humanitarian assistance.\nThe ongoing process of globalization does not mean\nthe disappearance of the diversity of civilizations and\ncultures, which coexist with increasing closeness. To the\ncontrary, this diversity itself constitutes a value which must\nbe used to promote solidarity and cooperation among\nnations. Indeed, serious crises \u2014 some of which I shall\nmention in this statement \u2014 continue to afflict the\ninternational community; unfortunately too, our ability to\ntake action is still often limited.\nThe situation in Africa is cause for serious concern,\nand justifies the special consideration our Organization is\ngiving to African crises. Suffice it to mention the armed\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the tragic\nhumanitarian crisis in Sudan \u2014 in the solution of which\nSpain is making a special effort to cooperate, the precarious\nsituation of Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, and the\nextremely serious exacerbation of tension in Angola, where\nUNITA must respect the Lusaka agreements and where the\nUnited Nations must continue to give its most valuable\nsupport to the peace process.\nIn Western Sahara, the parties must continue to\ndemonstrate their good will so that the referendum on self-\ndetermination envisaged in the Secretary-General?s\nsettlement plan can be held. The coming months will\nundoubtedly be crucial. Spain will continue to back the\nSecretary-General, his representatives and the United\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\n(MINURSO).\nThe situation in Kosovo is also extremely serious.\nSpain backs the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, but\nPresident Milosevic\u00b4 and his Government must understand\nthat the international community will not remain\nimpassive in the face of an indiscriminate use of force\nthat is creating a very serious humanitarian problem. A\nsincere negotiation process should be established as soon\nas possible to enable Kosovo to regain the necessary\npolitical autonomy in Yugoslavia.\nIn Latin America, the reconciliation process in\nGuatemala continues to make good headway, despite\nsome tragic incidents, and is an inspiring example. We\nare confident that the ongoing talks in Colombia will lead\nto a process of national reconciliation, an objective to\nwhich Spain has been giving its fullest support.\nAs regards the peace process in the Middle East,\nSpain is deeply concerned about the current standstill and\nactively backs the different initiatives presented,\nparticularly the European Union proposals, to safeguard\nthis process and implement the commitments already\nmade by the parties. There is an urgent need to put an\nend to this conflict, which has already lasted too long; it\nimplies a threat to stability, fundamentally in the\nMediterranean, but with global repercussions. We must\nfind a solution to achieve a long-lasting reconciliation of\nthe Jewish, Christian and Islamic cultures. Spain is, to a\ngreat extent, an example of such reconciliation, and we\nstand ready to make all necessary efforts to achieve this\ngoal.\nLastly, in Asia, Spain is following with great\nconcern the situation in Afghanistan. In another context,\nit is confident that the parties will succeed in reaching an\nagreement to form a Government in Cambodia after the\nrecent elections.\nI firmly believe that, after a period of excessive and\nunjustified hopes and consequent disappointments, now is\nthe time for the United Nations to forge determinedly\nahead in fostering an international coexistence based on\nrespect for human rights, justice and solidarity.\nNonetheless, this will only be possible if it has the full\nsupport of all of us. Spain hereby reiterates its fullest\ncommitment to the United Nations.\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Through you, Sir, I would like to congratulate the\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election, which\nwas so richly deserved because of his vast experience in\ninternational affairs and his well-known personal qualities.\nUruguay, a friend to Peru, represents the authentic\naspiration to peace and respect for international law that are\nstandards of conduct for Latin America and for Peru.\nI hereby reaffirm my country\u00e2s unwavering adherence\nto the purposes, principles and standards enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations, which provide a guarantee\nof harmonious relations among States and of the full\napplicability of international law, as well as a foundation\nfor the worldwide promotion of human rights, economic\nand social development and cooperation for development \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nall touchstones of international peace and security.\nOnly 10 years ago, the community of nations was\nmoved by the dream of building a peaceful, democratic,\nequitable and multilateral new world order. Today, while\nwe appreciate the continuing extension throughout the\nworld of those positive tendencies, we note as well an\naccumulation of negative developments that threaten to\ninitiate a period of uncertainty and change posing\nunprecedented challenges to our multilateral institutions\nand urgently demanding analyses and strategies to\nconfront them.\nThe world financial crisis is affecting the very\nfoundations of the international system. The provision of\nemergency financial relief may help individual countries,\nbut it does not contribute to the health of the system as a\nwhole, and it highlights the imperfections of the existing\nsupervisory mechanisms. There is thus a need for a\nreview of the Bretton Woods institutions and a revision of\ntheir policies so as to adapt them to current reality.\nThe growing imbalance among countries in the\neconomic and social areas is another deeply troubling\nelement. The 1998 Human Development Report indicates\nthat 20 per cent of the inhabitants of high-income\ncountries consume 86 per cent of the world\u00e2s goods and\nservices. In contrast, the poorest 20 per cent consume less\nthan 2 per cent. This reality underscores the urgent need\nto foster real sustainable human development throughout\nthe world, as well as within our countries, which are\nconfronting the challenge of relieving excruciating\npoverty.\nNot only is it urgently necessary to strengthen\nmultilateral institutions and achieve friendly cooperation,\nbut it actually can be done. A few indications of current\npositive trends are the worldwide consolidation of\ndemocracy, the recognition of the central value of\nindividuals and their inherent rights, the participation of\ncivil society, the need to modify patterns of consumption\nand production for the advancement of sustainable\ndevelopment, the development and dissemination of\ntechnology and the significant though as yet insufficient\nprogress in the fight against drug-trafficking and the\nstruggle against poverty.\nUnderstanding continues to grow among States\nregarding the concept of sustainable human development.\nFor the past eight years, we Peruvians have been engaged\nin a process of national reconstruction and structural\nreform, the overriding aim of which is the eradication of\npoverty.\n31\n\n\nThe Peruvian Government, under the leadership of\nPresident Alberto Fujimori, continues to implement a series\nof policies and programmes to improve the quality of life\nof all our citizens. The fundamental element of these efforts\nis the strategy for the fight against poverty. Our firm\ncommitment to eradicating poverty is reflected in the\nnational budget, which allocates more than 40 per cent to\nsocial spending. The national priority is the reduction of\nextreme poverty by 50 per cent \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from 19 per cent to 10\nper cent of the population \u00e2\u20ac\u201d by the year 2000. Along the\nsame lines, the Peruvian Government accords great\nimportance to policies aimed at achieving gender equality\nand the full participation of women, population policies and\npolicies for the protection of the most vulnerable: children,\nthe elderly, the handicapped and internally displaced\npersons.\nIn the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, Peru remains committed to\ngiving substantive meaning to its content, incorporating its\nprinciples in legislation and putting them into practice\nthrough education and information and by including them\nin policies of development. The protection and fostering of\nhuman rights is a priority and a duty for Peruvians, which\nis why we defend the universality, indivisibility,\ncomprehensiveness and non-discriminatory application of\nhuman rights.\nMy country has signed and ratified almost all the\ninternational instruments concerning human rights, both\nuniversal and regional. Consequently, we call upon those\ncountries that still are not parties to the two International\nCovenants on human rights and to the American\nConvention on Human Rights to ratify them, not only in\nhonour of the fiftieth anniversary but also so that they will\nbe consistent with the principles they continually espouse\nin the international arena.\nThe persistence of new non-military global threats \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nsuch as international terrorism, the intensification of\norganized crime, corruption and the problem of drugs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nadds to the gravity of the present international situation.\nPeru, which has suffered from terrorist violence, knows that\nthis barbarism constitutes an assault on the individual and\non society as a whole. It aims to destroy democracy and\nfundamental freedoms, in addition to threatening the peace\nand security of nations. In consequence, we consider all\nterrorist acts a systematic and deliberate violation of human\nrights that cannot be justified by any ideology or for any\nother reason, and that they should therefore be treated only\nas criminal acts.\nPeru categorically condemns terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations and urges the international\ncommunity to combat it vigorously. With the same\ndetermination, Peru reiterates that cases of international\nterrorism should be resolutely combated within the\nframework of international law.\nIn 1990 there were 120 thousand hectares of coca in\nPeru. Today, in a spectacular decline, this has been\nreduced by half, and with it the number of peasant\nfamilies linked to the coca economy. Through\nprogrammes of alternative development it is possible to\navoid a resurgence in the supply of coca leaves. We\ntherefore need to combine national efforts with\ninternational support to overcome a complex problem that\nis a matter of shared responsibility. In this regard, we are\npromoting debt-swap programmes for alternative\ndevelopment projects. We have also convened a donor\nconsulting group, which will meet next November,\nsponsored by the Inter-American Bank, the Inter-\nAmerican Commission for the Control of Drug Abuse and\nthe European Union.\nAs President Alberto Fujimori stated during the\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to the\ndrug problem,\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The purpose of the meeting is to secure the\ncomplementary financial resources required to\nimplement alternative development, prevention and\nrehabilitation programmes within the framework of\nanti-poverty policies and the sustainable management\nof natural resources.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (A/S-20/PV.2, p. 2)\nI strongly reaffirm that my country is committed to\nfighting drug-trafficking and its related effects until they\nare eradicated. The criminal structures of drug-trafficking\ncannot be given any respite during which they might\nreconstitute themselves. For this reason the international\ncommunity must intensify its joint efforts to put an end to\nthis scourge that affects humanity.\nBecause Peru has recently experienced a crisis\nsituation, we face major difficulties resulting from\ninternally displaced communities. Throughout the world\nthere has been a dramatic increase in the number of the\ninternally displaced in recent years, which makes it\nessential to strengthen United Nations action in this\nsphere. Consequently, we declare before the General\nAssembly the urgent need to further deepen and expand\nthe mandates, programmes and sources of funding for the\nsystem\u00e2s specialized agencies and bodies, with the aim of\n32\n\n\nprioritizing assistance to those countries affected by this\nproblem.\nPeru is a peace-loving nation which works for peace\nand rejects conflict; which aspires to strengthen political\nand economic cooperation with all countries and groups of\ncountries in different regions, on the basis of common\ninterests and mutual benefit.\nIn the realm of peace and security, the international\ncommunity must now unite against new tendencies towards\nnuclear proliferation and a growing number of internal\nconflicts and conflicts between States in various parts of the\nworld. To this must be added conventional arms races and\nthe hundreds of thousands of anti-personnel mines that are\nstill deployed in the world, whose shocking and unjust\nconsequences we all know. These facts together threaten to\noverwhelm the existing capacities of our countries and our\ninternational institutions.\nPeru vigorously supports general and complete\ndisarmament under strict international control. This is both\na necessary condition for peace and an ongoing task of our\nOrganization.\nDeplorable recent developments in the sphere of\nnuclear proliferation underscore the urgency of perfecting\nthe existing non-proliferation regimes and the imperative\nneed for negotiations on nuclear disarmament to go\nforward. The proposed fourth special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament will have to consider\nthese questions on a priority basis. We Latin Americans\nnow appreciate all the more the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which\ncreated in our region the first inhabited zone of the planet\nto be free of nuclear weapons, and we are continuing to\ndevelop ties of cooperation with other nuclear-weapon-free\nzones.\nMy country was the first Latin American State to\nratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and\nconsequently rejects any kind of nuclear test anywhere in\nthe world.\nThe Convention on anti-personnel landmines is a\npositive sign of change on the international scene. This\nmakes plain the humanitarian concerns that inspire the\nconscience of the world. We are pleased that it will enter\ninto force in March 1999, and are particularly interested in\nits full implementation after that date. Accordingly, the\ninternational community will have to give its active\ncooperation and make the utmost effort to remove or\ndestroy the mines already planted in every region of the\nworld.\nPeru was one of the first countries to ratify the\nOttawa Convention and it already begun to adopt its\napplicable provisions. We call upon all countries which\nhave not yet done so to ratify or adhere to the Ottawa\nConvention as soon as possible, as a contribution to\npeace, security, human coexistence and the development\nof our peoples. We trust that those States which have\nalready signed it but have not yet ratified it will comply\nwith article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of\nTreaties, under which signatory nations must abstain from\nacts which would frustrate the purpose of the Ottawa\nConvention.\nWe believe that the United Nations Regional Centre\nfor Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin\nAmerican and the Caribbean, which has its headquarters\nin Lima, can contribute to promoting a culture of peace\nand strengthening the efforts towards disarmament in the\nregion, including dealing with the problem of mines.\nIn the foregoing scenario, the reform and\nstrengthening of the United Nations system take on even\ngreater importance. Change and adjustment lead to greater\nefficiency. The process of structural and functional reform\nof the United Nations, rendered imperative by\nglobalization and changes on the international scene,\nmakes it necessary to ensure the coherence of its\nprogrammes and activities and to transform the\nOrganization into an agent of sustainable human\ndevelopment.\nWe believe that it is appropriate and timely to\ncontinue our efforts to define the criteria that should\nguide reform of the Security Council. Decisions on this\nfundamental matter should necessarily be adopted on the\nbasis of the broadest possible agreement and in the spirit\nand letter of the Charter of the United Nations, which\nwould itself be revised. The modifications we desire aim\ntowards a more representative and efficient world\nOrganization. In that regard, this effort must not give way\nto confrontation and discord. Let us rather support all\nefforts directed towards allowing the Organization to\nrespond to the real needs of all its Member States.\n33\n\n\nPeru pays tribute to the peacekeeping operations of the\nUnited Nations on their fiftieth anniversary and honours the\nmemory of the men and women, soldiers, police and\ncivilians, including Peruvian nationals, who have sacrificed\ntheir lives in this noble mission. The peacekeeping\noperations, in some of which my country took part, are\nemblematic of the responsibility that the Charter assigns to\nour Organization.\nWe wish to reiterate, Mr. President, our best wishes to\nyou and to the Assembly in this new period we are\nentering, which will surely have important implications for\nthe international community."

I wish you complete success in your important\nand noble task during these crucial times in our\ncontemporary world and in our international Organization.\nI also extend our gratitude and appreciation to\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko for guiding and presiding\neffectively over the fifty-second session. I would like in\nparticular to praise his leadership during the resumed\ntenth emergency special session of the General Assembly\non illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and\nthe rest of the occupied Palestinian territories.\nIt gives me great pleasure to commend the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, our friend\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his distinguished and wise\nleadership, and I congratulate him for the many successes\nhe has achieved in several fields. We had the honour,\nMr. Secretary-General, of welcoming you a few months\nago in our country, Palestine, where you observed and\nwitnessed first-hand the tragedy of the Palestinian people\nand the suffering they endure as a result of the continuing\nIsraeli occupation of our homeland, Palestine. It is my\nhope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you in\nthe future under better circumstances: on the day when\nthe occupation has been terminated and Palestine has been\nrestored its freedom.\nAs we approach the end of the twentieth century, our\nworld is witnessing \u2014 and all of mankind is\nexperiencing \u2014 great changes and important events, from\nglobalization and the problems of the international\nfinancial market to the technological revolution, satellite\ncommunications and the information age. All of the rapid\nchanges that have rocked our contemporary world require\nthe necessary enhancement of our collective work within\nthe framework of the United Nations. This should be\ndone on the basis of the purposes and principles of the\nCharter and for the bolstering of international cooperation\nin various arenas and for the acceleration of the North13\n\n\nSouth dialogue in order to establish a better world where\npeace, justice and prosperity for all mankind prevail.\nMany of the difficult and complicated tasks in this\nregard have been forced upon us and we must deal with\nthem effectively. We have before us the task of economic\nand social development \u2014 particularly that of the countries\nof the third world \u2014 solving the debt crisis and the\nproblems of poverty, famine, disease and migration in Asia,\nAfrica and Latin America. These challenges require the\nattainment of international comprehensive measures and\nequitable relations that are more rational and more just.\nMany global problems \u2014 such as terrorism, drugs,\nepidemics and organized crime \u2014 require strengthening the\nrule of international law, as well as the establishment of the\nnecessary institutions and mechanisms within the\nframework of the United Nations.\nIn this connection, we also welcome the adoption of\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is an\nimportant step in the promotion of law and in putting an\nend to atrocities and crimes against humanity.\nAll of these challenges and responsibilities should not\nprevent us from recalling that many of the basic tasks of\nthe international community in our contemporary world\nhave not yet been accomplished. There are peoples who\nstill remain under foreign occupation \u2014 including our\nPalestinian people, who have been and continue to be\nexposed to one of the gravest injustices. This great people\ndid not commit a crime; they did not commit aggression\nagainst anyone nor did they occupy the land of any other\npeople. However, they were the victims of aggression.\nTheir land was occupied and they were dispersed and\ncompelled by military force to a life in diaspora and exile.\nThere are still 4 million Palestinian refugees living in\ncamps awaiting the realization of international justice and\nthe implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy\nto accord them justice and put an end to more than half a\ncentury of the tragedy of living in exile as refugees.\nIt is also necessary to exert more effort to resolve\nmany of the regional conflicts and problems \u2014 including,\nof course, those in the Middle East; in the Balkan region,\nparticularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina; in Afghanistan and\nelsewhere. Special efforts and additional resources are\nnecessary to solve the problems of the African continent in\norder to allow that great continent to move forward on the\npath of development and progress. These should include\nseeking to restore normal conditions in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and achieving peace and stability in\nthe Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa.\nIt is also important to consider the issue of sanctions\nbecause of its terrible and destructive effects on peoples\nand on neighbouring States. Here I refer specifically to\nIraq, Libya and Sudan. While we call for solutions to\nthese problems and the lifting of sanctions on the basis of\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions, we\ncannot but express the feeling of many of us concerning\nthe use of double standards in implementing this\nprinciple. In this regard, I would like to express our\nsatisfaction with the progress that has been achieved, in\nparticular with regard to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nFinally, I turn to an extremely important question:\nthe question of nuclear disarmament, weapons of mass\ndestruction and non-proliferation. While strongly\nsupporting the goals of the international community in\nthis regard, we refer in particular to the immense problem\nexisting in our region of the possession by Israel of such\nweapons, and its refusal to accede to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and place its\nnuclear installations under the supervision of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. The small size of\nour region and its nature exacerbate the dangers stemming\nfrom the continuation of this situation. What occurred\nrecently in South Asia must encourage us all towards\nsincere cooperation and a commitment to the application\nof one standard with regard to this issue.\nIn order to accomplish all of these things, we need\na United Nations that is more effective. We support the\nefforts exerted by many States and the efforts of the\nSecretary-General in this regard. At the same time, we\nfeel and believe that our goal must go beyond reducing\nexpenditures, downsizing the Secretariat, streamlining the\nGeneral Assembly and expanding the Security Council,\nthough all of these are important issues. Our goal must go\nbeyond that to achieve the complete democratization of\nthis global Organization. In this context, it is necessary to\nenhance the role of the General Assembly and also to find\nsolutions to the veto question in the Security Council,\nparticularly its frequent and excessive use. Transparency\nand clear rules of procedure must prevail in the Council.\nAt this juncture, I should like to remind the Assembly\nthat since 1973 our question has been subjected to 21\nvetoes in the Security Council by one of the permanent\nmembers of the Council, the most recent of which\noccurred in a period of less than two weeks. In short, it\nis necessary to secure for all Members of the United\nNations the ability to contribute effectively on the basis\nof mutual respect.\n14\n\n\nLast May, the Palestinian people commemorated the\nfiftieth anniversary of Al-Nakba, the dispossession and the\nsuffering of the Palestinian people. Despite all of these\nbitter years, the oldest and largest refugee question in our\ncontemporary world remains unresolved, and our land still\nsuffers under occupation and colonial settlement. Its natural\nresources are subjected to exploitation, and the city of\nAl-Quds al-Sharif is still being subjected to Judaization,\nland confiscation, the demolition of homes, the confiscation\nof identity cards from its inhabitants, the imposition of a\ncertain demographic composition and artificial\nadministrative measures. There is also the isolation of the\ncity of Bethlehem and the conflict occurring in Al-Khalil \u2014\nHebron \u2014 and the rest of the Palestinian cities. Eight\nmillion Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to\nexercise sovereignty over their land, a right that the rest of\nthe peoples of the world enjoy.\nDespite all of this, despite the long and grave suffering\nand pain, and with long and legendary steadfastness, our\nPalestinian people have been able to survive and preserve\ntheir national identity. Our people chose the peace option\nand accepted the will of the international community in this\nregard. Accordingly, we decided with our Arab brothers to\nparticipate in the peace process, which began in Madrid in\n1991. Then we took the well-known historical step leading\nto the Oslo agreement with Israel, which was signed at the\nWhite House in Washington, D.C., under the auspices of\nPresident Clinton, on 13 September 1993. That development\ncarried the promise of an historic reconciliation and\ncoexistence between the two peoples, the prospect of a new\nMiddle East and the beginning of the establishment of a\ncomprehensive and permanent peace in the region.\nIndeed, all parties realized tangible achievements, and\nthe Palestinian people were able to start building their\ninstitutions and dealing with the destructive consequences\nof the long years of occupation. In particular, they held\ngeneral and democratic elections and established the\nPalestinian National Authority. Despite all of the difficulties\nthat confronted the process, the general trend to forward\nprogress continued, until the peace process was dealt a\nsevere blow by the assassination of the late Yitzhak Rabin,\nmy partner in the peace process \u2014 the peace of the\nbrave \u2014 by an Israeli extremist. This was followed by\nother blows resulting from the bombings and the grave\ndeterioration of the living conditions of our people and\ndeliberate acts to destroy the peace.\nWhen the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu took\noffice in Israel, a new chapter began with its adoption of\ngeneral political guidelines that were not consistent with the\nexisting agreements. The Government publicly tried to\ndiscard the principles of the peace process \u2014 Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978) and the principle of land for peace. It ceased\nimplementation of the existing agreements with the\nexception of the redeployment in Al-Khalil, which was\nachieved only after intensive American efforts. The Israeli\nGovernment continued to prevaricate and refrained from\nhonouring the obligations of the transitional period, which\nare of great importance to our people, including the safe\npassage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the\nairport, the seaport; the release of Palestinian prisoners\nand detainees in Israeli prisons, and the industrial zones.\nNeither the first stage of redeployment, which was\nsupposed to begin on 7 March 1997, nor the second stage,\nwhich was supposed to begin on 7 September 1997, were\neffected. Both of these, along with the third\nredeployment \u2014 the deadline for which has also been\nmissed since the middle of this year \u2014 should have led\nto the withdrawal of the Israeli army from 90 per cent of\nour land.\nMoreover, this Government\u2019s policies of economic\nsuffocation, closure and direct oppression of our\npeople \u2014 which costs us about $10 million a day \u2014\nconstitute an economic catastrophe. The Government has\ncontinued with the intensification of settlements and the\nJudaization of Jerusalem, the isolation of Bethlehem and\nthe old city of Al-Khalil, and the disapproval of the\noperation of the Palestinian airport, safe passage,\nindustrial zones and the seaport, in order to escalate the\nsuffocation and siege of our people and to destroy the\npeace process.\nAll of these policies and positions adopted by the\nGovernment of Mr. Netanyahu have caused the current\ndangerous situation and the complete stalemate in the\npeace process on the Palestinian track, as well as on the\nSyrian and Lebanese tracks, which have been completely\nstalemated. These policies and positions have also\nengendered the general tension prevailing in the region\nand the danger of descending into complete chaos. The\nwhole world has expressed grave concern at this and has\ncalled upon the Israeli side to change its policies and\npositions and to comply with the bases of the peace\nprocess and implement the existing agreements.\nIt is high time for the international community, in\nadherence with international law and in service to peace,\nto effectively and tangibly pressure the Israeli side to\nrealize the goals of peace, security and stability \u2014 not\nonly in the Middle East but internationally. This means\nimplementing the agreements that were signed at the White\nHouse under the auspices of President Clinton by the\nRussian Federation, the United States of America, the\nEuropean Union, Norway, Egypt and Jordan and in the\npresence of Japan. It means implementing Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the\nprinciple of land for peace, which were the bases of the\nMadrid Peace Conference.\nWith the hope of halting the deterioration of the\nexisting situation, the Palestinian side, in cooperation with\nmany of the concerned parties, has recently sought to\nintensify efforts, particularly with the help of the United\nStates co-sponsor \u2014 and especially with the help of\nPresident Clinton, to whom we express our gratitude. These\nefforts resulted in the United States initiative, containing all\nof the important pending issues, that was submitted to the\nparties concerned. As delegates are aware, the Palestinian\nside accepted this American initiative despite the fact that\nit did not meet our minimum just and legitimate demands.\nBut the Israeli side still rejects this initiative and continues\nin its attempts to undermine it and pre-empt its contents.\nPresident Clinton, thankfully, sent Secretary of State\nAlbright and Mr. Dennis Ross, who have made great efforts\nto move the peace process forward and protect it.\nDespite all these efforts, the Israeli Government has\nnot responded. Hence, we call upon the United States cosponsor to announce its initiative and to publicly and\nclearly put the onus on the party that is impeding peace.\nWe also call upon the United States to continue to work\neffectively in a manner consistent with its responsibilities\nto the peace process and with its interests and credibility in\nthe Middle East region, and so as to protect the region from\nthe dangers emanating from the destruction of the peace\nprocess.\nThis morning, President Clinton graciously took an\nimportant step to save the peace process and to move it\nforward by convening a meeting at the White House\nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli delegations. This was an\nimportant meeting to promote and preserve the peace\nprocess, and we thank President Clinton for that,\nparticularly as the efforts of the United States will continue\nto move the process forward and promote the\nimplementation of the signed agreements.\nIn this context we call upon the other parties\nconcerned, particularly the Russian Federation in its\ncapacity as one of the two co-sponsors of the peace\nprocess, as well as China and Japan, to activate and\nintensify their efforts. We also call upon the European\nUnion, with its economic and political interests and\ncapabilities, to move quickly and effectively to salvage\nand safeguard the peace process. In this same vein, we\ncall upon all Member States to support the FrenchEgyptian initiative to convene an international conference\nof all States determined to save the peace process from\nthe dangerous crisis it has reached.\nWe have not lost hope for the peace process, and we\nwill continue to honour our obligations in accordance\nwith the existing agreements. At the same time, we will\nnot give up on the necessity of Israeli compliance with\nthose agreements and the need for the Israelis to fulfil\ntheir pending obligations. We will not give up our\ninalienable national rights \u2014 the inalienable national\nrights of the Palestinian people.\nAt this stage, I wish to extend, on behalf of the\nPalestinian people, our deep gratitude to all the donor\ncountries and to the World Bank for their valuable\ncontributions aimed at alleviating the suffering of our\npeople and at assisting them in building and developing\ntheir homeland and at achieving meaningful economic and\nsocial development. I reiterate our gratitude to these\ncountries and the World Bank, particularly because they\nare contributing despite the obstacles and impediments\nimposed by Israel in this regard.\nIt is so difficult to separate the United Nations from\nthe question of Palestine, for this international\nOrganization has been dealing with our cause since its\ninception. It was the United Nations which partitioned\nPalestine, and to this time it has not ceased to deal with\nthe results of the events that followed, with the repeated\nand increasing injustices perpetrated against our people,\nfor which no remedy has yet been found. While\nreaffirming the permanent responsibility of the United\nNations for the question of Palestine, we appeal to all of\nyou to enhance your solidarity and support for our people\nin the coming period, through these critical circumstances,\non the basis of respect for the principles of the United\nNations Charter, international law and international\nhumanitarian law.\nWe expect that the Conference of the High\nContracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of\n1949 will be convened before the end of this year on\nmeasures to apply the Convention to the occupied\nPalestinian territory, including Al-Quds al-Sharif, in\naccordance with the recommendations made repeatedly by\nthe tenth emergency special session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations.\n16\n\n\nIn this context, we also expect Israeli participation in\nthe work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly to be in\nconformity with international law, thus ensuring that Israeli\ncredentials do not cover those territories determined by the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, since 1967, as\noccupied Palestinian and Arab territories, including\noccupied East Jerusalem. This is a matter on which there is\na consensus by the international community.\nFrom this venue, I would like to call upon all of you,\nthe source of international legitimacy and peacemaking, the\nguardian of freedom, security and stability and the source\nfor the achievement of justice and prosperity for\nhumankind, to stand by our people, especially as the fiveyear transitional period provided for in the PalestinianIsraeli agreements will end on 4 May 1999. Our people\ndemand that we shoulder our responsibilities, and they\nawait the establishment of their independent State. This\nindependent Palestinian State must be established as an\nembodiment of the right of our people to self-determination.\nI assure you that our people will continue to pursue and\nprotect the peace of the brave in the Middle East. We\nappeal to you to continue your support for us, as always in\nthe decisive moments of the history, the present and the\nfuture of our people. Help us to achieve the national goal\nof our people in the establishment of their State.\nIt is not admissible for Israel to continue dominating\nthe Palestinian people. Everyone is aware that 100 per cent\npeace means 100 per cent security and 100 per cent\nfreedom. One hundred per cent freedom. I repeat \u2014 100\nper cent peace, 100 per cent security and 100 per cent\nfreedom. One hundred per cent freedom. If the Israeli\nGovernment wants reciprocity, I declare from this podium\nmy demand of them for mutual compliance with the signed\nagreements, especially in the fields of security and the\nprotection of Palestinians and Israelis against all forms of\nviolence and terrorism and its sources. I invite the Israeli\nGovernment to engage in common, serious work between\nus to address that. There is no alternative to peace. Help us\nto achieve it.\nIn the year 2000, the past and the future will meet in\nPalestine, joined by a global vision of hope and peace for\nall peoples of the world. On that occasion, the world will\ncelebrate the second millennium of the birth of Jesus\nChrist \u2014 peace be upon him \u2014 and the beginning of a\nnew millennium. It is a religious and spiritual occasion of\ngreat importance not only for the Palestinian people and the\nregion, but also for all the believers in the world, as well as\nfor the entire international community. The Palestinian\npeople have actually begun serious preparations to celebrate\nthis important religious, historic and international\noccasion, with the cooperation of many religious, political\nand social institutions concerned. We call upon you to\njoin us in bearing the responsibility of these preparations,\nand we invite you to participate directly in the\nforthcoming celebrations to start together, God willing, a\nnew march.\nIn this regard, we appreciate the addition by the\nGeneral Assembly of a new item on its agenda entitled\n\u201cBethlehem 2000\u201d. We also extend our thanks to the\nChairman and members of the Committee on the Exercise\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for\ntheir initiative in this regard. I also take this opportunity\nto thank its sister Committee, the Special Committee to\nInvestigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights\nof the Palestinian People.\nI look forward to speaking to you once more when\nPalestine will have taken its natural place in the\ncommunity of nations, as an independent State, and when\npeace will have prevailed in the land of peace and in the\nentire Middle East.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me take this\nopportunity to congratulate the President and his country,\nUruguay, on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. I am convinced that his\nexperience and skills will help the General Assembly fulfil\nits important tasks.\nI would also like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine for his work as President and to commend him on\nhis decisive guidance during the deliberations of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly.\nThe world order is being rearranged. Our time is\nmarked by continuous change. It is of crucial importance\nthat this process of change take place in a peaceful way and\nunder the rules which the international community has\nagreed upon. The United Nations has an indispensable role\nin that regard and must be able to respond to the world?s\nneeds. While it is true that the United Nations is a\nframework within which the Member States can pursue\ntheir own national interests, the United Nations is above all\nan instrument for making the common goals and aspirations\nof humankind a realistic programme for a better future.\nThe world and its goals and challenges are changing,\nand the United Nations has to change as well. It was a wise\ndecision for the Member States to support the Secretary-\nGeneral?s programme for reform and help him undertake\nthe necessary measures. We are glad to see that some of\nthe steps of this excellent programme have already made\nthe United Nations more responsive and more effective.\nOnly an efficient universal organization can help us\ncope with the pressing challenges of globalization,\neconomic and social development, environmental changes\nand the urgent need to protect and respect human rights.\nWe need the United Nations to protect our highest and\nmost basic goal: the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Therefore, we expect that the remaining\nproposals of the Secretary-General will be approved by\nthe Members during this session of the General\nAssembly. This will allow us to move forward in the\nreform and transformation of our United Nations.\nSlovenia attaches special importance to the\npromotion of the noble principles and values upon which\nthe United Nations is built. This is why we were\nespecially proud to be elected a non-permanent member\nof the Security Council. The implementation of our key\nforeign-policy objectives, which we pursue in our work\nand endeavours in the Security Council, is, however,\nchallenged by an increasing number of threats to peace\nand stability. Judgement, compassion and determination\nmust guide us in our struggle to offer new hope for\nsuffering people.\nFrom the Balkans to Central Africa and Central\nAsia, a particular type of warfare seems to be prevailing\nin all conflicts. The civilian population is the main \u2014\nand, very often, also the only \u2014 target. Violations of\nhuman rights, international humanitarian law and the most\nhorrible atrocities are becoming the usual consequences of\nthese conflicts. These violations and their political root\ncauses must be addressed by the international community\nfrom the very start. We must act with unity and\ndetermination to ensure that violations of humanitarian\nlaw and human rights do not remain unpunished.\nThere are actors in the international community who\nstill believe that the threat or use of force is a legitimate\nmeans of change. They consider political solutions and\nnegotiations only after and if military options fail. We can\nsee this in Africa, where new crises are succeeding the\nold ones. We can see it in the continued arms race, even\nin the nuclear field. We can also see it in Europe, with\nKosovo offering yet another humanitarian tragedy. As if\nall of this were not enough, we also face the lowest, the\nmost unjustified violence of all \u2014 international terrorism,\nwhich has harmed hundreds of innocent victims.\n6\n\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina the peace process is slowly\nbut definitely extending its roots. However, this process has\nnot yet become irreversible. The international community\nstill has an important role in leading the post-conflict\nmanagement of the situation. There is a growing need to\nensure economic reconstruction and provide adequate\neconomic aid. Slovenia is actively participating in those\nefforts.\nMany important issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nremain to be solved. The number of returning refugees,\nespecially among minorities, has been substantially lower\nthan expected. In this regard, we commend the role of the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, its Multinational\nSpecialized Unit and the international police transition force\nfor their role. Democratization and reconciliation are\nindispensable elements in consolidating peace in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Reconciliation, however, does not mean\nimpunity. In fact, there will be no reconciliation until all\nwar criminals are brought to justice. To this end, we expect\nthe cooperation of all countries concerned.\nThe situation in Kosovo has been giving rise to\nlegitimate international concerns for quite some time now.\nSerious violations of human rights have been reported for\nyears. In recent months the population of Kosovo has been\nsubjected to a campaign of terror and forced to flee their\nhomes and seek refuge in the woods and mountains. The\ninternational community should prevent humanitarian\ncatastrophe this winter and force all the parties in the\nconflict to face their responsibilities. All forms of violence\nagainst the civilian population in Kosovo must stop. The\nKosovo population needs a ceasefire and needs negotiations\nto start now. This is a prerequisite for the process of the\nreturn of refugees to start.\nThe United Nations has the means to organize an\neffective international action for the maintenance of peace.\nThe Security Council is addressing most of these problems.\nAt the moment, Slovenia is proud to be a non-permanent\nmember of the Security Council. We are doing our best to\ncontribute to the common effort to ensure that peace is\nmaintained, international obligations respected, justice done\nand innocent lives saved wherever and whenever possible.\nSlovenian armed forces already participate in actions\nto consolidate peace, security and stability. The conduct of\npeace-support operations is an expression of Slovenia?s\npolitical will and a reflection of the readiness of our armed\nforces.\nThe wealth of experience the United Nations has\naccumulated is impressive. However, in many ways\nreform of its 50-year-old structure would greatly enhance\nits effectiveness. Slovenia shares the view of the majority\nof Member States that the Security Council also needs to\nbe and should be reformed. It should become more\nrepresentative and more up to date by expanding the\nnumber of its non-permanent as well as permanent\nmembers. It should become more effective in its decision-\nmaking. Last but not least, it should become more\ntransparent, for its decisions affect all the Member States.\nThis year?s session of the General Assembly will be\nmarked significantly by the commemoration of an\nimportant event, which continues to be an important\nsource of inspiration for United Nations activities today.\nFifty years have passed since the adoption of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, a historic\ndocument that recognized the inherent dignity and equal\nand inalienable rights of all members of the human family\nas the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the\nworld.\nThis is an appropriate time to reflect on what has\nalready been achieved and what still remains to be done\nin the field of human rights. This is the time to reconfirm\nour commitment and show our determination to promote\nand protect the whole spectrum of human rights \u2014 civil\nand political, as well as economic, social and cultural.\nWe believe strongly that the promotion and\nprotection of human rights is a legitimate concern of the\ninternational community and calls for a high level of\ninternational attention and cooperation. Slovenia strongly\nsupports the work of the International Criminal Tribunals\nfor the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and is pleased\nto see the first ever verdict on the crime of genocide\nhanded down by an international criminal court. We also\nsee this as the most gratifying way to mark the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide.\nThe successful completion of the United Nations\nDiplomatic Conference on the establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court on 17 July of this year is a\nhistoric step towards making the rule of law and human\nrights truly universal. We hope that this will help provide\njustice for victims, limit impunity and deter acts of\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the\nnext century.\n7\n\n\nThe signing of the Ottawa Convention was an\nimportant step forward towards the total ban of anti-\npersonnel landmines. We all have to start a global process\nof demining and mine clearance operations in thousands of\nmined areas all over the world. At the same time, the\nprocess of the physical and mental rehabilitation of millions\nof mine victims throughout the world should start as soon\nas possible. Slovenia has already joined this process. The\nGovernment of the Republic of Slovenia established the\nInternational Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims\nAssistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main purpose\nof the Fund is to raise financial resources and organize\ndemining operations and a programme of rehabilitation for\nmine victims from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to\ntake this opportunity to invite other countries to join us in\nthis noble effort.\nAt the end of the cold war, many countries anticipated\nthe end of the nuclear era. We were expecting an\naccelerated process of elimination of nuclear weapons.\nUnfortunately, and notwithstanding important successes in\nthe reduction of nuclear arms, the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons has increased in recent years. Slovenia strongly\ndeplores nuclear tests and appeals to all countries to end\ntheir military nuclear programmes.\nSlovenia demonstrated its determination to contribute\nto nuclear disarmament by joining seven other non-nuclear\ncountries \u2014 Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand,\nSouth Africa, and Sweden \u2014 in launching the joint\ndeclaration of eight Ministers for Foreign Affairs entitled\n\u201cTowards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new\nagenda\u201d [A/53/138]. The prime goal of our action was to\nstart new efforts for nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear\ndisarmament. We, the representatives of eight countries, are\nfirm in our efforts to enable forthcoming generations to\nenjoy a world free of nuclear weapons.\nThis is the time for concrete action and visionary\ninitiatives. The evolution of the international system\nrequires both. Slovenia is aware of this important need. We\nbelieve that such basic issues of international security as the\nissue of nuclear arms need to be addressed in a realistic and\ncomprehensive manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am certain that this session will provide us with\nthe opportunity to discuss the role that the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights has played during the last\n50 years and has yet to play.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to convey\nmy respects to the Secretary-General, who, by his\ndecisive steps in critical moments this year, has\nrepeatedly demonstrated the importance of the United\nNations in contemporary world affairs.\nThroughout the last 50 years the United Nations has\nchanged no less dynamically than the rest of the\nsurrounding world. Reviewing the successes and failures\nof the Organization, we have to acknowledge its complex\nand important role in building a more peaceful world. The\nUnited Nations at present is living through a complicated\nperiod of internal reform designed to reinforce the values\nand principles which half a century ago encouraged the\nStates of the world to sign the Charter establishing the\nUnited Nations, which guides us today into the twenty-\nfirst century. I speak of peace, democracy and the\nenvironment and of ensuring and promoting the\ndevelopment of freedom of the individual.\n\n\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption by the General Assembly of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This crucial instrument\ndeclares the will of the people of the world to establish a\nuniversal understanding of individual freedom, equality and\ndignity, which are indivisible and must not be undermined.\nToday we should be particularly concerned to what extent\nthe principles declared by the United Nations throughout\nthe last 50 years have become the bedrock of our everyday\nlife. It would be most appropriate to ask whether the United\nNations has become an Organization of world nations rather\nthan States.\nIn the contemporary world of advanced\ncommunications, the exchange of values and ideas takes\nplace at a particularly high speed. It is therefore not\nsurprising that freedom, justice and well-being carry the\nsame meaning in Europe and Asia, Africa and America. I\nbelieve we are approaching a common denominator for\ndemocracy so that democracy will no longer be identified\nonly with the West and rapid economic development only\nwith certain regions of the world. Above all, we hope that\nthe realization of human rights throughout the world is\nconsistent with the spirit of the Declaration of Human\nRights signed 50 years ago.\nIn the cold-war world of divided ideologies, the\nUnited Nations was one of the very few forums embodying\nthe common human interest: the concern for peace. Today\nthe United Nations can contribute considerably to the\ncreation and education of free individuals and active\ncitizens of the world.\nHistory has proved that democratic and prosperous\nStates provide the most favourable environment for human\nactivities. The United Nations should therefore continue its\nefforts to promote democratization and sustainable\ndevelopment. The ongoing institutional reform of the\nOrganization may serve this end. However, I should like\nalso to underscore the need to pay even greater attention to\nthe promotion and protection of human rights.\nWillingly and freely we have empowered the Security\nCouncil to make binding decisions to which we are then\ncommitted. We therefore want the decisions to be of high\nquality, effective and acceptable. Two highly qualified\nindustrialized countries could become permanent members\nof the Security Council; their membership would strengthen\nthe Council and ensure democratic decisions. A broader\nrepresentation of developing nations on the Council would\nalso reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect for it.\nThese nations deserve additional seats, both permanent and\nnon-permanent. Equitable representation in the Council\nshould be expanded through a more just representation of\nregions, Central and Eastern Europe in particular.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights, Mary Robinson, has noted that today\u00e2s human\nrights violations are the causes of tomorrow\u00e2s conflicts.\nWar-ravaged Bosnia and conflict-inflamed Kosovo today\nare painful illustrations of these words. Lithuania\nwelcomes the initiative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nto integrate human rights protection into the broad range\nof the Organization\u00e2s activities. We likewise welcome the\nongoing institutional reforms of human rights protection\nand propose to employ with greater effectiveness the\nexperience and intellectual potential of such regional\nbodies as the Council of Europe and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.\nOne of the most laudable recent achievements of the\nworld\u00e2s nations is the adoption of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. By taking this decision, the\ninternational community demonstrated its readiness for a\nqualitative leap in international relations based on an\neffective system of international justice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an instrument\ndesigned to complement national legal systems and to\nencourage their continuous development.\nIt is gratifying that the Court has been granted the\nright to charge persons with criminal responsibility for the\ngravest crimes of all: genocide, war crimes and crimes\nagainst humanity. This step demonstrates our resolution\nto fight against the horrors for which there are no \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and\ncannot be any \u00e2\u20ac\u201d political or ideological boundaries.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Crime of aggression\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the Statute is a pending issue\nrequiring the political will of States and a more precise\nlegal definition. The bitter facts of modern history remind\nus that aggression too often leads to genocide, war crimes\nand crimes against humanity.\nI would like to note that Lithuania, which actively\nparticipated in the work of the Preparatory Committee and\nthe Rome Conference, will in the near future sign the\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\nToday we all face the challenges of our\ncontemporary world which have been caused by rapidly\ndeveloping technologies and negligent human activities.\nThese challenges, although not as evident as open military\nconflicts, are no less threatening. A devastated and\ndeteriorating environment may cause conflicts on a scale\nunknown before. The struggle for fresh water, rich soil\nand natural resources can turn man against man and\n2\n\n\nnation against nation. Neither democratic political processes\nnor economic development will matter then.\nAs a man with a long-standing commitment to\nenvironmental protection, I invite you to make use of the\ninternational capabilities of the United Nations and to pay\nmore attention to ecological issues. If we are genuine in our\nattempt to place this institution at the vanguard of human\nrights protection, environmental issues should be given\npriority on our agenda. Lithuania will support every\ninitiative to preserve and conserve natural resources. As one\nsuch step, I yesterday signed the Kyoto Protocol,\nreaffirming our commitment to tackling global warming by\nreducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Now we look\nforward to decisive action on climate change in Buenos\nAires later this year.\nEvery individual has the incontestable right to live in\na healthy and clean environment. I am certain that the\nUnited Nations can play a significant role in promoting\nrespect for the environment among people and States of the\nworld. With its long experience in international cooperation\nand its prominent international standing, this Organization\ncan contribute notably to the environmental education of the\nglobal community. It can also serve as a promoter of inter-\nState cooperation through the timely exchange of\ninformation on disasters \u00e2\u20ac\u201d past, present and future. The\nPrior Informed Consent (PIC) Convention on trade in\nhazardous chemicals and pesticides, which was signed in\nRotterdam a couple of days ago, is a remarkable example\nof prospective activities of the United Nations system.\nThe growing problems of international crime and\nterrorism affecting us are no less important than\nenvironmental issues. Terrorist bombings and illicit\ntrafficking in arms, narcotic substances and human beings,\nas well as money laundering, infringe the vital interests of\npeople and States to live in a secure and predictable world.\nThe solution to these problems demands collective efforts\nas well as resolute and immediate action. It is gratifying\nthat the heads of State and Government, as well as interior\nministers, confirmed their commitment to constructive\ncooperation at the twentieth special session of the United\nNations General Assembly, on drugs. The approved drug-\ndemand reduction and prevention programme, along with\nthe guidelines for international cooperation, should facilitate\nthe resolution of these problems.\nChildren and young people \u00e2\u20ac\u201d our future \u00e2\u20ac\u201d should be\nthe focus of the fight against drug-trafficking. Timely\nadoption and launching of preventive measures and\neducational programmes, as well as the building of a drug-\nfree environment, must be our immediate first steps. It is\ndelightful that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has shown\nparticular attention to this problem.\nControl of the arms trade, which is becoming\nincreasingly complex, is another painful reality facing us\nat the end of this century. Smugglers arm not only\nterrorists, but also nations or States at war. Without any\nfurther delay we should forestall illicit arms circulation\nby, first and foremost, restricting the sale of small arms\nand light weapons in conflict zones. We should persist in\nour efforts to find an effective solution to the issue of\ngeneral and complete disarmament.\nThe nuclear arms race, which emerged in South Asia\nthis year, has revealed the survival of the cold war\nideology of the balance of powers in the political thinking\nof certain States. Such reasoning is short on\nconstructiveness since it does not enhance international\nsecurity, and it diverts human resources and creative\npowers into erroneous directions, undermining the\naspirations of the individual to a safer and wealthier life.\nLithuania is neither a zone of potential conflict nor\na place for the manufacturing or circulation of\nconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction.\nNevertheless, Lithuania endeavours to participate actively\nin different agreements on disarmament and arms control\nthrough which it helps itself and others. My country has\nratified the conventions prohibiting biological, chemical\nand certain conventional weapons. Ratification of the\nconvention prohibiting anti-personnel mines is our long-\nterm goal.\nIt is my belief that the right of the individual to a\nsecure life and future \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a right still missing from the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights \u00e2\u20ac\u201d fully\ncorresponds to the spirit of the Declaration and should be\nrealized through our political initiatives. The security of\nthe individual will be best ensured if the State he lives in\nis secure. Good neighbourly relations and close regional\ncooperation are prerequisites for the peaceful coexistence\nof nations, and all humankind aspires to this. Lithuania is\nguided by those principles and maintains friendly,\nconstructive relations with all its neighbours, Russia\namong them.\nThe United Nations today acts not only in a multi-\npolar but also multi-problem environment. By itself it is\nnot capable of addressing and resolving all the problems\nwhich we often tend to call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d issues and which\ndemand immediate solutions. Therefore, the Organization\n3\n\n\nshould interact with greater vigour in its endeavours with\nregional organizations that, in many cases, succeed in the\nareas where global forums fail. Europe has already provided\nus with an example of such productive interaction through\nconcrete cooperation of the United Nations with the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nEurope, however, has other, smaller organizations\nwhich can also considerably contribute to the goals of the\nUnited Nations and to the implementation of their spirit.\nThe Council of the Baltic Sea States, of which Lithuania\nhas recently assumed the chairmanship, is one of them.\nThis Council unites geographical neighbours who also enjoy\nmany, more binding links: the promotion of mutual\nconfidence, trade, culture and environmental protection.\nDuring the term of its chairmanship, Lithuania will strive\nfor a more active and effective contribution of this regional\ncooperation body to the implementation of the goals of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights is a reminder of the indivisibility of the\nvalues of human life, dignity and welfare. Political activities\nat both the international and national levels should be\ndirected to promoting and protecting these values. More and\nmore threats to human rights and freedoms arise today from\nsources beyond the control of national Governments. Never\nbefore have the issues of coordination and enhanced\ncooperation been as crucial as they are today. The United\nNations possesses all the potential necessary to perform the\nrole of active international coordinator and peace promoter.\nBut the realization of this potential requires determination\nfrom us, the representatives of nations and members of the\ninternational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "eychelles is pleased to see\nMr. Opertti at the helm of this session of the General\nAssembly. We welcome the experience, expertise and skills\nwhich he brings to our deliberations. Likewise, we wish to\nexpress our appreciation to his predecessor for his\noutstanding contribution and leadership during the fiftysecond session.\nOur felicitations also go to the Secretary-General for\nspearheading courageous and innovative reforms aimed at\nrevitalizing the United Nations at the threshold of the new\nmillennium.\nWe support the measures being undertaken to make\nthe United Nations more efficient and effective, capable\nof making optimal use of its resources. My delegation\nbelieves that development ought to be central to the\nrenewed United Nations agenda. For this reason, we hold\nthat a larger proportion of United Nations resources\nshould be allocated to development, particularly to meet\nthe growing and imperious needs of the developing\ncountries. It is only in so doing that the objective of\nattaining a \u201cdividend for development\u201d can be attained.\nReform of the United Nations cannot be complete\nwithout the reform of its main organ responsible for peace\nand security: the Security Council. We are all agreed on\nthis, but we differ on how to go about it. Yet there is no\ndoubt that the Security Council should be transformed\ninto a democratic and representative organ, reflecting both\nits universal character and present-day realities, and\ntaking into consideration the need for balanced\nrepresentation in its membership.\nMany options have been mooted. But there are still\nmajor obstacles to overcome if we are to agree on the\ncomposition of the enlarged Council, the creation of new\npermanent seats and the question of the veto right for\nboth current and prospective members. We need to move\nand harmonize positions in order to arrive at a generally\nacceptable solution. And in so doing we must reckon with\nthe fact that the developing countries of Africa, Asia and\nLatin America are and will be major stakeholders in the\nformulation of the international power structure of the\ntwenty-first century.\n\n\nEqually important for my delegation is that the reform\npackage should encompass the enhancement of the General\nAssembly as the supreme policy-making organ of the\nUnited Nations. It is only through the reinforcement of the\nAssembly\u2019s role and mandate that we can successfully\ntackle some of the most pressing issues facing humanity,\nnot least the process of globalization. Globalization has\nbrought prosperity to some. However, in this new global\nvillage, many of its inhabitants \u2014 especially those in its\nslums \u2014 face the prospect of further impoverishment and\nmarginalization. For them, the spectre of poverty, hunger,\nmalnutrition, inadequate shelter and disease is a constant\nreality. It is their daily lot. It flouts human dignity. No one\nshould have to live and die in poverty. This is not how we\nenvisage the destiny of the greater part of humankind in the\ntwenty-first century.\nSo the greatest challenge facing us, the United\nNations, is the eradication of the slums of our global\nvillage. If we want to get rid of the scourge of poverty, we\nneed to redress the present imbalances. We need to ensure\nthat all countries of the world benefit from the effects of\nglobalization.\nOur basic contention \u2014 and I do not think that it is\ntoo much to ask for \u2014 is that we should be able to increase\nour share in the global economy, be it through trade or\nthrough the mobilization of foreign direct investment. As\nsmall developing economies, we face the enormous\nchallenge of building our export and institutional capacities\nto allow us to assume our place in this fiercely competitive\nglobal environment.\nIf we are to attract investments, improve product\nquality, meet standards \u2014 in short, compete effectively and\ngrasp the opportunities presented by the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) agreements \u2014 then it is imperative\nthat the international community recognize the need to grant\nus adequate transitional support.\nIt is in this context that my delegation appeals to the\nEuropean Union to accept the African, Caribbean and\nPacific group of States\u2019 request for an extension of trade\npreferences under a WTO waiver for a protracted period of\ntime, within the framework of the successor agreement to\nthe Lom\u00e9 IV Convention. Genuine cooperation should take\ncognizance of the special development need of weaker and\nvulnerable partners to adjust to the demands of\ncompetitiveness. We need time to allow a transitional\nperiod of preparation and adjustment. And we need to do\nso under fair conditions.\nWe small island developing States are the weaker\nand more vulnerable members of the international\ncommunity. It is a well-established fact. But whilst\nmomentum has been created for the recognition of our\nspecial characteristics and constraints, it is somewhat\ndisappointing to note that avowed intentions have yet to\nbe translated into action. How are we to interpret this\napparent inertia in the application of the so-called\nvulnerability index? How are we to interpret this apparent\nindifference to the problems we face, especially in\nrelation to security, sustainable development and\nenvironmental protection?\nVulnerability has taught us in the Seychelles a few\nlessons, though. Whilst our voice is little heard in this\nforum, whenever we are asked about our role on the\nworld stage our response generally reveals an impressive\nscoresheet in such areas as conservation of the\nenvironment and an equally ambitious vision of our place\nin the world. We continue to work very hard to ensure\nthat the development necessary to give our people a high\ndegree of social well-being does not affect the \u201clast\nsanctuary on Earth\u201d, as we call ourselves.\n\u201cEnvironment\u201d for us is not a fashion statement. We\ndo not intend to give any lessons, but we certainly intend\nto be the conscience of the world. Whilst others, infinitely\nmore powerful and developed than we are, pollute and\nspoil, we preserve and protect. We have set aside some\n45 per cent of our national territory for the protection of\nnature. And we have offered to the international\ncommunity two of its most precious natural treasures as\nWorld Heritage Sites.\nBut all this has a cost. We bear the brunt of it,\nconscious of our responsibility to future generations,\nconscious that planet Earth is our common heritage. Ours,\nthough, is a shared responsibility, requiring global\nsolutions to a global problem. And the solution is to be\nfound not in rhetoric, but in action. Therefore, we expect\nthe industrialized nations to pay less lip service to\nenvironmental protection. We expect them to be\naccountable and to meet their Kyoto commitments. Above\nall, we expect them to get their act together and clean up\nthe mess we are all in.\nVulnerability has also taught us to live in racial\nharmony, to make ours the ideals for which the United\nNations stands for. The force of our social cohesion lies\nin our racial diversity. Africans, Asians and Europeans\nhave forged our nation, resulting in a happy marriage of\nraces that has led to an eclectic population of 79,000\n2\n\n\npeople living in harmony and tolerance. When we see what\ngoes on around us \u2014 wars, acts of wanton terrorism and\ndestruction, savagery and barbarism \u2014 all in the name of\nsome insane ideology, religious, racial or political, we fail\nto comprehend. We fail to understand, perhaps because we\nhave learned to live together as one nation, regardless of\nracial origin or political or religious conviction.\nWe try very hard to mitigate the effects of our\nvulnerability. If we have achieved some degree of success,\nit is through the prudent and often painstaking management\nof our natural resources. It is also through the judicious use\nof international aid and grants that we have received over\nthe years. We have not wasted a cent of what has been\nawarded to us. We have managed overseas development\nassistance by creating a beneficial multiplier effect that has\ntrickled down into all spheres and levels of our national\ndevelopment. Unfortunately, the logic and unwritten laws\nof international cooperation will have it that we have\nbecome victims of this very prudent use of aid. We seem\nto have worked ourselves off the list of nations that qualify\nfor such help.\nIn this interdependent world of ours, the ramifications\nof globalization have proved that the world order has no\nfrontiers. Solutions to the challenges of the new\ninternational order are to be sought through international\nsolidarity and cooperation, through the vehicle of\nmultilateralism. This presupposes that every member of the\ninternational community should enjoy peace and security.\nUnfortunately, too many conflict situations persist, negating\neconomic growth and social progress. The African continent\nhas been disproportionately afflicted by intra-State and\ninter-State conflicts.\nAt the special meeting of the Security Council on\nAfrica in April this year, we urged the international\ncommunity to put its full weight behind African peace\ninitiatives, but also to reinforce the institutional and\noperational capacity of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) in the prevention, management and resolution of\nconflicts in Africa. Finding durable solutions to our\nproblems in Africa requires a concerted and integrated\napproach by the international community if we want to\nmake the African renaissance a reality in an era of global\nsolidarity and partnership.\nSpeaking of peace and security, we cannot but\nempathize with a fellow small island State \u2014 Cyprus \u2014\nwith which we are sentimentally bound in a common\ndestiny. The division of the island has persisted for too\nlong. We cannot allow it to continue as a fait accompli. Nor\ncan we condone the presence of foreign troops there.\nCyprus is a unitary, sovereign State whose intercommunal\nproblems can only be resolved on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nIn a separate but related context, we note with regret\nthe continuing tension in Greek-Turkish relations. My\ncountry, like all peace-loving nations, would like to see\nGreece and Turkey establish good-neighbourly relations\nbased on international law and treaties, as well as on the\nbasis of the principles enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter. Differences are bound to remain, but these can\nbe resolved within mechanisms available in international\nlaw, in particular, through the jurisdiction of the\nInternational Court of Justice. We urge Turkey to accept\nthe Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nWe are conscious of the inequalities and double\nstandards which prevail throughout the world. The rules\nof the game, more often than not, are not tipped in favour\nof the smallest among us. Indeed, relations between\nnations give the lie to the statement that we are all equal.\nThis is the reality of things. We do not say that we\nnecessarily accept the status quo. But we have learned to\nlive with it. Neither do we accept that squalor, injustice\nand poverty should be the norms guiding relations\nbetween human beings in the next millennium.\nSo, in recognizing our own shortcomings and\nfailures, we also recognize that humankind is presented\nwith a unique opportunity to right the wrongs and\ninjustices that it has perpetrated.\nWe are also presented with a unique opportunity to\nmake our planet, our only home, a better, cleaner and\nsafer place to live. We can do so through a proactive\nUnited Nations. It is not a perfect institution. But it is the\nonly institution which represents the collective conscience\nof humanity. It represents the unique, indispensable forum\nfor shared international responsibilities and global issues\nwhich affect the entire community of nations.\nThe United Nations remains our greatest hope for\njustice, peace, security and development. It remains our\nonly hope for a more compassionate world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the\nGovernment of Chile and in my personal capacity, on\nyour election as President of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly, which represents a deserved tribute to\nyour political skills and diplomatic career, as well as a\nrecognition of your country?s commitment to the work of\nthe United Nations. It gives us very special pleasure\nbecause you are a national of Uruguay, a Latin American\ncountry that is especially close to Chile, and with which,\nin addition, we are cooperating closely in the Rio Group\nand the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).\nWe also congratulate the Secretary-General on the\nleadership he has demonstrated since he took up his\nduties. His vision of the necessary reform of this\nOrganization, as well as his dedication to the solution of\nimportant international problems, gives us great\nsatisfaction. We encourage him to persevere in pursuit of\nthe goals he has set himself.\nGlobalization, interdependence and regional\nintegration are phenomena that characterize present-day\ninternational realities. The experience of many countries,\nChile among them, shows that greater participation in the\nworld economy, if appropriately channelled, can constitute\na key element in the economic growth and prosperity of\ncountries. Nevertheless, these phenomena, whose logic\nand dynamics are universal in scope, still offer ambivalent\nand contradictory lessons and meanings, depending on\ntheir magnitude and the effects they are causing in the\ndifferent parts of the world. It is obvious that this process\ngives rise to legitimate uncertainties and concern in the\ncontext of the financial upheavals that, having started in\nthe Asia/Pacific region, now affect the whole world. The\nneed for more effective and concerted action by the main\ninternational economic Powers and the specialized\n22\n\n\nagencies to deal with these situations is becoming\nincreasingly apparent. The need to reshape the global\nfinancial architecture is becoming ever more obvious.\nIt seems clear that there is a need for greater\ncoordination regarding the international community?s\ninstitutional capabilities to deal with situations like the\npresent one. The world has experienced similar situations\nbefore, but they now take place in a context of much\ngreater interdependence. This necessitates an in-depth\nreview of the current structures of the world financial\nsystem in order to adapt them to the new challenges of\ninternationalization. Otherwise, we shall always be\nvulnerable to upheavals like the present ones, and to\nsetbacks in those parts of the world that are affected.\nObviously, no agency of the multilateral system, on its\nown and using only its own methods, is in a position to\nbring certainty and stability to the current crisis. In the\nsearch for solutions, we need to combine different\napproaches and concerns: financial order, growth of\ninternational trade, effective social security networks,\npromotion of investment and growth, and respect for\nworkers, among others. We have a great opportunity to\ngrasp fully the integrated nature of these problems and\ndefine genuinely coordinated policies in order to solve\nthem. This is a task in which the entire international\ncommunity must participate. The Latin American countries\nhave assumed their responsibilities for building sound\neconomies with increasingly low levels of inflation,\nprogressively decreasing their budget deficits and reducing\nunemployment and indebtedness.\nWhat Chile has done in this respect is recognized, and\nhas been frequently praised in recent years. In little over a\ndecade, Chile has doubled the size of its economy. This\nyear, 1998, will be our twelfth year of uninterrupted\ngrowth. For eight years we have been constantly reducing\ninflation and unemployment, with a financial surplus and\nhigh domestic and external savings rates. All of this has\ntaken place in a context of great openness to the outside\nworld and a regional integration process conducted with a\nview to promoting open regionalism. It has also taken place\nin the context of an increasing expansion of social\ninvestment, whose benefits for the most vulnerable sectors\nof the population are apparent in the high indicators\nachieved by Chile in this Organization?s latest Human\nDevelopment Report.\nHowever, despite these significant achievements we\nhave also had to face in recent months problems that we\nshare with many countries in our region, stemming from the\nglobal financial crisis and the difficulties created in some\nof our main export markets. President Frei's Government\nhas adopted stringent adjustment measures in order to\nreduce public and private expenditure, avoid an upsurge\nof inflation, and, at the same time, maintain social\ninvestment and protect Chileans? jobs.\nThis permits us \u2014 as the Heads of State and\nGovernment of our region did when they met on 5\nSeptember at the Twelfth Rio Group Summit \u2014 to call\non all to discharge their responsibilities in this respect, as\nwe have discharged our own. Our Presidents are\nconcerned about the possibility that the crisis will become\nmore acute, and accordingly they urge the countries in\nwhich it arose to take the necessary measures to correct\ntheir imbalances; the countries of the Group of Seven to\ntake action to restore the stability of financial markets and\nensure the growth of the world economy; and the\ninternational financial institutions to involve themselves\nmore rapidly and effectively in resolving the crisis.\nThere is also a need to prevent a mishandling of the\ncrisis or half-way measures leading to the reproduction or\neven accentuation of the inequities that characterize the\ncurrent international system, which not only postpone\naccess to progress and encourage despair, but also pose a\nserious and constant threat to international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe emergence of a new worldwide awareness, the\nenlargement of the international agenda and the need to\ndeal collectively with the problems of interdependence\nprovide an impetus for the adoption of new international\nregimes. Examples of the progress achieved in\ncooperative multilateralism include the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, the Antarctic Treaty,\ninternational humanitarian law, the Uruguay Round\nagreements that led to the creation of the World Trade\nOrganization and the set of regimes relating to arms\ncontrol and disarmament in general.\nHuman rights have ceased to be an issue reserved\nexclusively for the sovereignty of countries, and have\nbecome a universal concern that no Government can\nignore. Protection of the environment has an undoubtedly\ninternational dimension, in that issues as vital to our\nfuture as climate change, pollution and over-exploitation\nof the seas, depletion of the ozone layer and the advance\nof desertification all call for global treatment.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms constitute an inescapable\n23\n\n\nresponsibility of the United Nations. The fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand the fifth anniversary of the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, held in Vienna, constitute opportunities to\nrenew our concern for and commitment to the values and\nprinciples embodied in the Declaration and the agreements\nadopted at the Conference.\nFor Chile, the universality of human rights means\nassuming the intrinsic dignity of all inhabitants of the\nplanet, regardless of their culture, religion, social status,\nethnic origin, gender or traditions. Neither lack of\ndevelopment nor cultural characteristics can be invoked to\njustify limiting the human rights recognized in a\nDeclaration to which we have all subscribed. In this\ncontext, the recently approved International Labour\nOrganization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and\nRights at Work and its Follow-up is an important step\nforward in strengthening the basic rights of workers\nthroughout the world. This new international regime must\nbe promoted by the entire multilateral system.\nA few days ago, I had the great honour of signing in\nRome, on behalf of my Government, the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. Chile has committed itself to\nparticipate actively in the launching of the Court. This\ninstitution has been a long-standing aspiration, and many\nrecent events have made it essential. It will contribute to\nthe strengthening of the international human rights regime,\nthe progressive development of international humanitarian\nlaw, the prevention of mass violations and the fight against\nimpunity in cases of genocide or crimes against humanity.\nThe subject of disarmament also continues to be one\nof the most vital issues on the international agenda. Recent\nevents in this field, such as the nuclear tests carried out in\nSouth Asia, which my Government deeply deplores,\nhighlight the urgent need to enhance the validity and\nuniversal application of instruments such as the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We must\ntake responsibility for the danger of nuclear proliferation\nand urge the parties concerned not to repeat such actions,\nand we must renew our calls on all States to sign and ratify\nthe international instruments designed to eliminate the\nnuclear threat. Accordingly, we welcome Brazil?s recent\naccession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nWe must also make efforts to develop and improve\nour instruments for regulating the manufacture, trade and\nuse of conventional weapons. In this context, we are\nextremely pleased to know that the Treaty on the\nelimination of anti-personnel landmines has entered into\nforce with the completion of the first 40 ratifications.\nChile hopes to complete its process of legislative approval\nshortly in order to be able to ratify this important\ninstrument. For these same reasons, we adopted this\nmorning, together with other countries, a declaration\nsupporting the ad hoc group in its work to strengthen the\nverification and monitoring mechanisms of the Biological\nWeapons Convention.\nChile strongly favours the process of establishing\nnew international regimes, whether regional or global, to\nconfront these and other challenges. The United Nations\nplays a vital role in this field.\nThe campaign against drug-trafficking and other\nforms of organized crime can be truly effective only when\nit takes place in a context of strong and genuine regional\nand worldwide cooperation. Chile supports the\nimplementation of the decisions adopted at the twentieth\nspecial session of the General Assembly, on the world\ndrug problem, decisions which can serve as a basis for a\ncommon regulatory system and effective multilateral\ncooperation.\nThe fight against international terrorism, which has\nperpetrated such reprehensible acts this year, also requires\na much more effective international cooperation. Such\ndramatic issues as the treatment of refugees and\ncombating hunger fall fully within the scope of\nmultilateral activity. My country attaches great importance\nto this function of our Organization. We believe that it\nmust continue to be expanded and intensified in the years\nto come. Of course, Chile is fully prepared to continue\nparticipating in this task.\nIn the context of our participation in the United\nNations, I wish to express my gratitude to the Member\nStates, as well as to the employers? and workers? groups\nof the International Labour Organization (ILO), for the\nsingular confidence placed in Chile and its Ambassador\nto the United Nations, Mr. Juan Somav'a, by electing him\nDirector-General of the ILO, beginning in March 1999.\nMy Government wishes to express its profound\nsatisfaction at having been a part of the Security Council\nduring the biennium 1996-1997. In the exercise of the\nresponsibility entrusted to us by the international\ncommunity, my Government sought in every action it\ntook to contribute to the maintenance of international\npeace and security and to fully assume the humanitarian\n24\n\n\nresponsibility placed upon the Security Council in its\nactivities.\nWe have always believed that this responsibility\nshould be manifested in the protection of the humanitarian\nworkers in conflict zones, in the ongoing presence of the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies subsequent to\nthe ending of hostilities so as to build peace effectively and\nin the focused application of sanctions that are adopted so\nthat they will not affect innocent civilians.\nChile is convinced that the United Nations\npeacekeeping forces can be identified as the Organization?s\nmost effective mechanism for preventing and resolving\ninternational conflicts. We are aware that peacekeeping\noperations designed to take action in crises and conflicts\nbetween States have been faced with major challenges\nduring the present decade. Nevertheless, for all the well-\nknown limitations, the experience built up over the past\nthree years can be regarded as promising for the future.\nMany more human lives could be saved through United\nNations peacekeeping operations, were we able to\nstrengthen them effectively. My Government wishes to\nexpress its firm resolve to continue cooperating, actively\nand frequently, in the activities of this important instrument\nof the Organization.\nThree years ago, when we celebrated the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, Member States assumed\na commitment to unite our efforts to reform and\ndemocratize the structures of the Organization, with a view\nto the new and complex challenges we shall have to face in\nan increasingly changing international scene. This session\nof the General Assembly has the task of taking up\nimportant pending aspects of that reform. The adoption of\nresolution 52/12 constitutes an important first step down the\nlong road to reform.\nWe are also encouraged by the changes that are being\nintroduced in the Economic and Social Council. The\nintroduction of new methods and programmes and the\nincorporation into its agenda of a segment on humanitarian\naffairs will contribute to its renewal.\nThe summits and conferences on economic and social\nissues that have been held within the framework of the\nUnited Nations during the 1990s have reaffirmed our\nOrganization?s priority commitment to development.\nLikewise, those events have provided conceptual tools and\nideas that are of great value for drawing up public policies\nfor achieving economically, socially and environmentally\nsustainable development.\nThe eradication of poverty must continue to be a\ncentral objective. The same is true of the promotion of\nhuman rights, gender equality and protection of the\nenvironment. It is essential that the General Assembly\nconduct periodic reviews of the commitments made on\nthese issues at the summit meetings and conferences, as\nis to happen in the case of the International Conference\non Population and Development, which is to be reviewed\nnext June, and the Fourth World Conference on Women,\nthe review of which will take place in the year 2000.\nWe also attach special importance to the special\nsession of the General Assembly to be convened in the\nyear 2000 for the purpose of reviewing compliance with\nthe commitments of the Social Summit. Chile has had the\nhonour of presiding over the preparatory committee for\nthat special session. It is our hope that that meeting will\nbe able to conclude with the adoption of new initiatives\nat the national and international level that will allow\nfurther progress to be made in the process of\nimplementing the agreements reached at the Summit.\nThe process of reforming and democratizing the\nSecurity Council is one of the most important of the\nmany objectives we have set ourselves in the context of\nthe process of renewing the United Nations. The Council\nmust reflect the new international realities. It needs to be\nenlarged to remedy, among other things, the unjustified\nunder-representation of the developing countries in that\nbody.\nNevertheless, the arduous process of reform in which\nwe are engaged calls for broad-based majority support. It\nwill be possible only with solid and substantive\nconsensus. Frankly, we would prefer to sacrifice some of\nthe urgency of such reforms rather than participate in a\ndecision-making process which, lacking the support of the\nvast majority of members, could give rise to serious\ndivisions between us.\nFurthermore, my Government believes that\nenlargement of the Council, important though it may be\nfrom the standpoint of enhancing its representativeness\nand legitimacy, is not of itself sufficient to endow the\nCouncil with the qualities required by its role as the\nguarantor of international peace and security. At the same\ntime, measures must be adopted with regard to its\nworking methods, particularly in relation to transparency,\nwith which every one of its actions should be imbued and\nwhich should not be challenged.\n25\n\n\nWe must stress the negative impact of the veto\nmechanism, which should be regulated and progressively\nreduced with a view to its gradual elimination in the long\nterm. A first step in this direction might be to amend the\nCharter so that the right of veto can be applied only to\nactions taken by the Council under Chapter VII.\nI should like to conclude by expressing our optimism\nwith regard to the future of the Organization. I hope that\nthe Millennium Assembly, to which we have lent our full\nsupport, will be the expression of a renewed and much\nstronger United Nations as we enter the new century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your election. I wish you good\nfortune and all of us a successful session.\nI should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko for\nthe dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty-\nsecond session. He advanced the reform process at the\nUnited Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and must\nfollow up these efforts.\nThis session of the General Assembly has a special\nsignificance for my country. It was 25 years ago, almost to\nthe day, on 19 September 1973, that Walter Scheel became\nthe first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of\nGermany to address the United Nations. When he described\nour perception of the United Nations, he said that it meant\nmore than the mere security of States, more than the mere\nregulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that what\nit is all about is the beginning and the objective of any\nrational policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d people.\nThat description of our role in the United Nations\nremains valid. United Germany too feels committed to a\nworld free from fear and want, protected by the rule of law,\na world in which every individual has his opportunity and\nwhich preserves the integrity of Creation for future\ngenerations. It is the vision enshrined in the International\nBill of Human Rights.\nWe have come a lot closer to that vision over the past\n25 years. The division of Germany, Europe and the world\nhas been healed. The world is developing ever more into\nthe \\\"one world\\\" on the foundations of democracy and\nhuman rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear that\nthe human race has never been so bound up together in its\ncommon destiny, united by common challenges, as it is\ntoday.\nThe crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the world\neconomy. The global scourges of drugs, organized crime\nand terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. The\nyear 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds of\nBangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods in\nChina have claimed thousands of lives.\nNo State, whether super-Power or small island State,\ncan master these global challenges alone. And no one can\nescape them, least of all the suffering people: the\nhomeless in Bangladesh, the drug addict in Europe, the\nvictim of civil war in Africa.\nWe can shape our future only through joint efforts.\nWe therefore need global action and global management\nfor the global challenges of the twenty-first century; not\ntomorrow or the day after, but today.\nThis is a test not only for Governments but also for\nthe other global players: the non-governmental\norganizations and the multinational corporations. Never\nwere the non-governmental organizations so important as\nthey are today. Without them the Ottawa Convention\nbanning landmines could not have been signed in\nDecember 1997. And, let us not forget, 51 of the world's\nhundred largest economic entities are now companies, and\nonly 49 of them States. All this shows that the time has\ncome for new alliances for peace, freedom and prosperity\nthroughout the world.\nThe age of globalization is the age of the United\nNations. Only here do all nations of the world come\ntogether. Only here can we find joint solutions to the\nglobal challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why we\nGermans want to help get the United Nations in shape for\nthe twenty-first century. We are facing up to this\nresponsibility - as the second largest export nation and\nthe third largest economy in the world, and as the country\nwith the largest population in the European Union.\nWe owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitude\nand support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to the\nMember States. The Security Council still mirrors the\nworld as it was at the end of the Second World War, but\nnot the enhanced status of Asia, Africa and Latin America\nwith the Caribbean.\nThe same is true of the greater weight of Japan and\nunited Germany. I wish to thank all Member States that\nadvocate a permanent seat for Germany on the Security\nCouncil. Security Council reform cannot be delayed any\nlonger; otherwise, the momentum will be lost and that\nwould be bad indeed.\nSince the ending of the cold war the United Nations\nhas had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It therefore\nneeds effective institutions, and for this reason it has a right\nto expect members to pay their dues on time. All, and\nespecially the big members, must help according to their\nability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplish\nits tasks. Germany, the third largest contributor, will\ncontinue to meet its obligations.\nWe know from recent experience that we should not\nadd to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations.\nThis is a task especially for regional organizations like the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). If\nthey succeed in settling conflicts locally, the Security\nCouncil will not need to deal with them. I think that would\nbe very well-advised, because it would free capacities for\nall of us.\nNew avenues of joint action are therefore called for.\nTo pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd.\nOnly those who face up to the challenge can exploit the\nopportunities and cushion the risks.\nThe impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows that\nthe world economy needs a reliable framework. That is not\nto say we need a global financial authority or fixed\nexchange rates, least of all a new wave of protectionism.\nBut we do need better early-warning mechanisms, more\ntransparency and more efficient banking systems, especially\nin the newly emerging economies.\nThis is not a task for Governments alone. What is\nneeded now is a global public-private partnership between\nGovernments, international financial organizations and\ncorporations. We therefore support the American initiative\nfor a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emerging\neconomies on a new international financial architecture. The\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank\nshould not always have to serve as the stopgap when the\nopportunity for structural reforms has been missed.\nManaging globalization also means weaving a network\nof partnerships between the big regional groupings and the\nbig countries. The regional groupings are the components\nof a new global order under the roof of the United Nations.\nThe European Union's partnerships with regional\norganizations like the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN), the Southern Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) and the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) prove we are on the right course: We\nwant an open, not a confrontational, kind of regionalism.\nI am confident that the European Union will be an\nanchor of stability in the twenty-first century. By\nintroducing a single currency on 1 January 1999, it is\nfocusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It is\nabout to begin further negotiations on accession with\nassociated partners. What Willy Brandt said about\nGermany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe:\n\\\"What belongs together is now growing together\\\".\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) too\nis also gradually opening its doors to the new\ndemocracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it will\nadmit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Together\nwith Russia, Ukraine and the other Commonwealth of\nIndependent States members, we are developing a\ncomprehensive security partnership.\nTrue, the Russians are having a rough time at\npresent, but the world needs a democratic and stable\nRussia, a Russia which will play the role commensurate\nwith its size, its status and its potential. Russia faces a\nHerculean task of consolidating the economy and\nmaintaining social stability. All those responsible must\nface up to the challenge: the President, the Government,\nthe parties and business. Of course, the regions too are\ncalled upon.\nI know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakov\nlast week in Moscow that Russia intends neither to\nchange course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russia\naffects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can count\non us.\nThe Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europe\u00e2s\nside. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of the\nword is looming. The situation of the refugees, more than\n250,000 of them, is desperate. International organizations,\nthe European Union, the United States and Russia are\ncoordinating their efforts to enable those who have been\ndriven out to return to their villages.\nTime is getting short; winter is just around the\ncorner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with\nBelgrade, with President Milosevic. He must realize that\nthe international community will react with military force\nif necessary. We still seek a political solution for\nKosovo \u00e2\u20ac\u201d self-administration within the Yugoslav\nFederation. However, this cannot be achieved without\nBelgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now be\nsilenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslav\nsecurity forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The\nrecent reports we have received from Kosovo are very\ndisappointing, troubling and worrisome. I hope they are not\ntrue.\nNATO is prepared to provide the backing for a\npolitical solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part of\nEurope. Their future can only be a European one. The\nhistory of Europe in this century shows that we can\novercome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have the\nwillingness to do so.\nIn Bosnia, too, we have seen animosity slowly being\nreplaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid my\ntwelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowly\nbeginning to blossom again, and the country's\nreconstruction is progressing.\nNonetheless, the peace process must continue to be\nbuttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR),\nfor the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of the\nresult of the elections, the international community will not\ntolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peace\nagreement. Furthermore, genuine peace will not return until\nthe presumed war criminals and enemies of peace -\nMr. Karadzic and his lot- have been brought to trial in\nThe Hague.\nOnly when those guilty of crimes against humanity,\ntorturers and terrorists all over the world, have been\nbrought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully.\nThus, the establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt on 17 July as a major step towards a world order in\nwhich the force of law, not the law of force, prevails.\nGermany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries to\nsign and ratify the Court's Statute.\nNo one stands more at the mercy of those who wield\npower than refugees. At present more than 20 million\npeople worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people,\nwomen, children; people who are sick, homeless and\ndestitute and have absolutely no idea what is going to\nhappen to them.\nOver the last several years I have been to many\nrefugee camps, in Albania, Africa and the Middle East.\nEvery refugee's case is a story of immeasurable human\nsuffering.\nGermany is now the country with the second largest\nnumber of refugees. From Kosovo alone, 150,000 refugees\nhave found refuge in Germany.\nThe suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian and\npolitical challenge to the international community as a\nwhole. What is now needed, therefore, is a global refugee\npolicy. The United Nations, too, has to do something\nabout it.\nSpecifically, this means, first, a more equitable\ndistribution of the refugees, as I recommended here in the\nGeneral Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorest\ncountries to their own devices in trying to cope with the\nrefugee problem.\nSecondly, greater efforts will have to be made to\nremove the causes of flight and expulsion.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the\ntwenty-first century a century of prevention, and with\ngood reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad that\npeople have to take flight is to make oneself partly\nresponsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud.\nThis is the task of preventive diplomacy, of human rights\nobservers and peacekeeping forces.\nStriking at the root of mass flight and migration also\nmeans eliminating the economic, ecological and social\ncauses. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. The\nwealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume\n86 per cent of all goods, the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3\nper cent.\nThis equity gap must be closed. Every individual has\na right to live in dignity, free from hunger and want.\nAll nations must be given a fair chance in global\ncompetition, the poorest ones in particular. Hence, it is up\nto the rich countries to help the poor make the most of\ntheir opportunities for development.\nOur aim is a social world market economy. This is\nwhy in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche marks\non bilateral and multilateral assistance measures as an\ninvestment in peace and stability.\nAfrica shows what can be achieved when the\ninternational community and the countries concerned pull\ntogether. Today, democratic elections are held in more\nthan half of the African countries. In 20 African countries\neconomic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent, and in 11\nit is higher still.\nWe want the Africans to know that we will not\nabandon that vast continent and its 800 million people,\ndespite the heavy burdens it still has to bear.\nPoverty and refugee problems are also exacerbating\nthe situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and in\nthe Palestinian territories long for peace more than anything\nelse on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus.\nThe Israelis and Palestinians must move towards each\nother again and rediscover the lost mutual trust.\nWe Europeans will continue to support this process\nwith our American friends. We back Israel's legitimate\nclaim to security for its State and citizens.\nThe Palestinians have recognized that claim; now\nwords must be followed by deeds. They must see to it that\nterrorism has no chance.\nBut Israel, too, must show compromise as regards a\nfurther partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any new\nobstacles in the way of a deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that includes allowing\nnew settlements in the occupied territories.\nParticularly in the Middle East, we have time and\nagain seen that terrorism leads to a dead end, destruction\nand suffering. We must pit all our strength against the\ncynics who advocate violence, the fanatics and ideologues;\nthe dead of Omagh, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as a\nwarning. Those who plant bombs and murder people must\nbe brought to justice.\nDrying up the sources of terrorism \u00e2\u20ac\u201d poverty, ethnic\nconflict and fundamentalism \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is our common\nresponsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam.\nIslam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could be\nfurther from the truth than the cliche that Islam is\nsynonymous with fundamentalism and violations of human\nrights.\nWe want a dialogue of cultures and religions,\nespecially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanity\nthat unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienable\ndignity of every individual, as expressed in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the human rights\ncovenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarks\nfor our joint action in the twenty-first century.\nViolations of human rights are no longer an internal\nmatter of States. They concern us all. Any group which,\nlike the regime in Kabul, denies women their basic human\nrights places itself outside the international community of\ncommon values.\nThe world of tomorrow will be judged by how we\ntreat our children today. They are our most valuable asset.\nYet the rights of many children are still being trampled\nunderfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live a\nlife in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work.\nParticularly appalling is the fact that every year\nsome two million children all over the world are sexually\nabused. Only through joint action can we stop child\nprostitution, traffic in children and child pornography,\nincluding that proliferated via the Internet. I therefore\npropose that the United Nations set up a contact point to\ncoordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse of\nchildren. The optional protocol to the Convention on the\nRights of the Child designed to afford better protection\nagainst sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted and\nquickly put into effect.\nChildren are small people who need big rights.\nProtection for children during armed conflicts must be\nimproved, including by outlawing their use as soldiers.\nWe all hoped that with the ending of the East-West\nconfrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration would\nbe gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. The\nthreat of proliferation of means of mass destruction\nhovers over the human race. We can safeguard world\npeace in the twenty-first century only if we keep such\nterrible weapons under control.\nIn Geneva, India and Pakistan have agreed to\nnegotiations on a cut-off. That's a good sign, but not\nnearly enough. It must be followed by their accession to\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And all\nnations should now sign the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. This also applies to the conventions banning\nchemical and biological weapons. The adoption of a\nverification protocol to the Biological Weapons\nConvention is now urgent.\nNext March the Ottawa Convention imposing a\nworldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters into\nforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a great success. Only if all countries now sign\nthe Convention will these diabolical devices soon be\nwiped from the face of the earth. It is our common task\nto get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining, using\nstate-of-the-art technology.\nWe must also radically rethink our attitude to nature.\nThe victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are a\nwarning. We must swing the wheel round now. This we\nowe to our children and grandchildren. We can save our\nblue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all.\n\nTake the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launched\na global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward.\nBut time is getting short. We have just had the warmest\nhalf year this century. At the fourth session of the\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, scheduled for Buenos Aires\nin November, we shall have to agree on the instruments\nwith which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto.\nTake water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is more\nimportant than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is in\nshort supply. Two billion people have insufficient access or\nnone at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutions\nfor the peaceful use and conservation of water, the source\nof life, is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century.\nThe pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowed\nto spark fresh conflicts.\nGermany intends to remain in the vanguard of the\ninternational campaign to protect the environment. I am\ngratified to note that our commitment has been\nacknowledged by the appointment of Klaus T\u00f6pfer as\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme.\nBut we are not going to rest on our laurels. A few\ndays ago I opened an international conference in Potsdam\non early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. The\nconference has shown that progress can be achieved if we\nwant it. Specifically, it is now a question of establishing\neffective global early-warning systems for environmental\ncrises and natural disasters, and developing emergency\nmanagement arrangements for the coordination of\ninternational relief measures. We must now get down to\nthis task, and the United Nations is the right place to do so.\nFour hundred and sixty three days from now the\ntwentieth century comes to an end \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a century of\nunprecedented violence and destruction. The coming\ncentury must be a century with a humane countenance.\nWhat a wonderful vision. But talking about it is not\nenough. Only if we act together will we survive together.\nThe United Nations is indispensable to this task.\nStrengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitable\nworld \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is our responsibility. This we owe to coming\ngenerations. My country will devote every possible effort\nto this task.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, as I address the Assembly for the\nfirst time as President of Colombia, I should like to offer\nyou, on behalf of my Government, our warmest\ncongratulations on being elected to guide our debates\nduring this session.\nA few weeks ago, the most important democratic\nelections in Colombia\u2019s recent history took place. Despite\nthe problems that have besieged our nation in the last few\nyears, our institutional structure has faced one of the\nsternest tests ever and has again shown that it is solid. In\nJune, more than 12 million people \u2014 one of the highest\nelectoral turnouts in the history of the Republic \u2014\nexpressed their free, spontaneous and conscious choice.\nToday, Colombia is looking towards new horizons.\nWe have restored confidence in our country. We have\nstarted the changes which will enable us to face our\ninternal problems with determination and which will win\nus a more positive and dynamic place in the international\ncommunity.\nOur most urgent task will be to build for peace. That\nis the unshakable commitment of my Government and the\n\n\nheartfelt desire of all of the Colombian people. We are\naware that any process designed to root out the causes of\nconflict for all time will be highly complex. But all our\nefforts will be dedicated to this noble goal, and we will\nstrive for it tirelessly.\nIt is for this reason that I have personally taken the\nlead in building peace. We are working hard on the\npreparation of an agenda for this purpose. We are\nconvinced that representatives of all sectors of society\nshould play a part, and that at the end of the road we will\nfind a guiding light that will lead our country again to\npeaceful coexistence. Peace in Colombia will also be\nfounded on a clear strategy for economic development and\na bold policy for social justice. Only in this way will it be\npossible to forge a fruitful and lasting peace.\nAs we travel the road to peace the support of the\ninternational community will complement our own efforts.\nWe will advocate respect for fundamental rights and\nfull application of international humanitarian law among all\nthose involved in conflict. We will learn from the valuable\nexperiences of other countries in the solution of internal\nconflicts, and we will adopt whatever is applicable and\nappropriate to our own situation.\nPeace in Colombia will demand very substantial\ninvestments in social sectors and infrastructure in the zones\nof conflict. For this, we will create a \u201cPeace Fund\u201d. A\nsignificant portion of the money required will come from\ninternal sources. We will also be looking for contributions\nfrom the international community, from which we have\nalready received expressions of encouragement, solidarity\nand interest.\nAll these actions will be part of what we have termed\n\u201cdiplomacy for peace\u201d. It will be diplomacy with social and\neconomic content. It will be diplomacy expressed in\ninvestment and in the mobilization of human, technical and\nfinancial resources, so that our peace will have a firm and\nlasting foundation.\nThe achievement of peace in Colombia will be an\nimportant initial contribution to the liberation of mankind\nfrom one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest evils: the\nglobal problem of illicit drugs. To the extent that we can\nfind agricultural alternatives for our peasant farmers, with\nfair prices for their products at home and abroad, they will\nbecome less dependent on illicit crops. The support of the\ninternational community will be crucial in this. The\neradication of illicit crops will be one of the central\nelements of the peace talks that we intend to undertake\nwith the groups engaged in armed conflict.\nIt is true that the end of East-West confrontation\nbrought into being a system of international relations\nbased on d\u00e9tente and on a decline in the role that military\npower had played during the cold war. The spectre of a\nnuclear cataclysm seemed to have vanished, and all\nhumanity embraced new hopes for the future.\nIt was thought that the end of the cold war would be\nthe salvation of the many countries and the millions of\npeople who had been forgotten in the midst of tensions\nand feuds between the two superpowers. But now, almost\n10 years later, those initial expectations are far from\nbecoming a reality. Ethnic and religious rivalries, regional\nconfrontations and grave new threats to peace have\nemerged.\nI must say most clearly that my Government and the\npeople of Colombia absolutely reject all kinds and modes\nof terrorism, whatever their origin or motive. There can\nbe no truce with terrorism. All States must fight together\nto defeat it. This is surely one of our greatest challenges.\nCorruption is buffeting democracy in a growing\nnumber of countries and is becoming a cause of political\nand social breakdown. Illicit drugs continue to be one of\nthe worst scourges of today\u2019s society, bringing irreparable\nharm to the new generations and, therefore, to the future\nof humanity.\nHuman rights are still not properly respected.\nWomen are still the target of abuse and discrimination.\nChildren are the victims of disgraceful practices. Fifty\nyears after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, the more vulnerable groups often have no\naccess to the protection that States are obliged to provide\nfor them.\nUnsustainable consumer and production practices\nstill continue. The planet\u2019s natural resources are being\ndepleted, its biological wealth is being looted, and our\nrivers and oceans are being contaminated. Poverty\ncontinues to affect huge segments of society. Economic\ngrowth in some countries and the prosperity of some\nlevels of society contrast dramatically with the\nmarginalization suffered by the majority of the world\u2019s\npopulation.\nThis situation is occurring in an international\nenvironment in which the right to development is\n2\n\n\nindissolubly linked to the existence of a favourable\ninternational climate. We are going through the most\nserious financial crisis since the end of the cold war, but\nthere does not yet seem to be sufficient clarity and political\nwill to face it and overcome it.\nAll Latin America has voiced its concern at the gravity\nof the crisis. Its origins are outside our region, in which\ncountries have made structural reforms to achieve healthy\neconomies that will enable them to meet the social\nexpectations of their peoples.\nWe are aware of the risk of a world recession, and we\nconsider it essential that the more developed countries, the\nGroup of Seven and the international financial organs adopt\nsuitable measures to prevent any new collapse. Such a\ndisaster would irreversibly affect the developing countries\nfirst. The measures should enable the financial markets to\nrecover their stability and provide a rapid solution to the\ncurrent crisis in the world economy that has caused so\nmuch concern.\nAmong the proposals which Colombia made at the San\nFrancisco Conference and which were included in the\nUnited Nations Charter, there are two I would now like to\nmention, because they belong to the common heritage of\nour foreign policy: first, compliance in good faith with the\nobligations assumed by the Member States of the United\nNations, as an underlying assumption for the validity of its\nuniversal action; and secondly, recognition of the role\nplayed by regional arrangements and agencies in the\nmaintenance of peace, in international security as an\nintegrated concept and in the peaceful settlement of disputes\nbetween States.\nColombia believes that universalism and regionalism\nare complementary and should support each other\nharmoniously. Therefore, one of the aims of our diplomacy\nis to strengthen the regional agencies within the concept of\nuniversalism. It is thus essential that we join our efforts to\nregain the momentum achieved on the occasion of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations, so\nthat the Organization will be revitalized and ready for the\nbeginning of a new millennium.\nThe various levels of action required are all based on\nthe credibility of the multilateralism which the United\nNations embodies and the trust which our peoples have in\nit. Some support the approval of certain reforms that the\nexperience of this period of history and the changes on the\nworld scene have in themselves made imperative. The\nUnited Nations cannot be expected to possess magic\nformulas that we ourselves do not have for solving\nproblems and situations that concern us all, within the\ncontext of the interdependence and internationalization\ncharacteristic of our times. But we certainly need to adapt\nthem to this moment in history, when we face such wide\nhorizons and colossal challenges. We need something of\nthe idealism and pragmatic spirit which could be inspired\nby solidarity among the human race.\nThe reasons for the creation of the United Nations\nnot only remain intact, but also have rapidly even become\nmore relevant in the second half of the twentieth century.\nThe principles which inspired its creation have become so\nimportant that any action taken unilaterally or by a group\nof States turns out to be inadequate or limited in effect.\nTherefore, it will be useful to identify what we can do to\nmake the proposed reforms truly worthwhile. One must\nseek a genuine consensus for the agenda of priorities for\nthe new millennium.\nColombia is ready to help reconcile existing\ndisputes. This is not a question of a simple, formal\nagreement or of a quest for utopian reform, but of a\nmeeting of wills and a methodical and open-minded\nconsensus regarding proposals which are designed to\nbring us closer to an era of greater justice and balance.\nWe must eliminate the contradiction in which more\nresponsibilities, actions and programmes are demanded\nfrom the United Nations while at the same time some\nStates fail to meet their obligations or do not show any\nwillingness to increase their contribution in proportion to\ntheir capacity. Without doubt, the United Nations must be\nproperly funded. The adaptation of structures, regulations\nand modes of operation means that the Organization must\nhave the personnel and the funds it needs, through\nefficient and exemplary management.\nCooperation for development must receive a massive\ninjection to save it from decline, and this must be in\naccordance with the text and spirit of the Charter and of\ncountless commitments, within an overall concept that\nincludes encouragement of respect for human, individual,\nsocial, economic and cultural rights.\nMy Government has a policy of encouraging broader\nparticipation by the new actors on the international stage,\nsuch as non-governmental organizations and the private\nsector. New sources of funding for certain social,\ndevelopment and humanitarian programmes should be\nsought, which should extend the scope of action of the\n3\n\n\nUnited Nations and ensure that it continues to steer the\ncommon course of international solidarity.\nWe need multilateralism with social content, in which\nthe human being is the central priority and in which\ndevelopment is the guiding principle in decisions. I stand\nbefore you to appeal to all nations to contribute to the\nburial of the post-cold-war period, to see it as no more than\nan interregnum, and to open the door wide to an era of\ncreative and more humane multilateralism.\nThe original principles of the Organization are of\ncourse still valid, but we need to make some adjustments.\nWe need to reconsider certain modes of international action\nand heed the voices of the peoples who desire development\nand fight for it in the midst of difficulty and conflict. We\nneed to strengthen communication and dialogue between\nNorth and South and to correct unreasonable imbalances.\nWe believe that the time has come to make an\nobjective review of the present state of negotiations for the\nreform of the Organization, in order to ensure that social\nand economic matters are properly related to the legitimate\naspirations of developing nations. There must be\ninstruments to encourage rapport between the organs\noriginating from the San Francisco Charter and those\ninstitutions born at Bretton Woods.\nWe know that the responses of individual nations or\ngroups of States are insufficient. Therefore, there is an even\nmore urgent need to coordinate global responses through\nvigorous multilateralism. There is an obvious dichotomy\nbetween de facto globalization, science and technology,\ninstantaneous communications and the world market, on the\none hand, and, on the hand, the absence of genuine social\norder and human advancement.\nWe must revive an authentic and productive North-\nSouth dialogue, based on a concept of solidarity which is\nmore substantial than declarations or good intentions and\nwhich is expressed in specific action. It must take account\nof the needs of the more vulnerable groups and of those\nexcluded from progress. It must replace the logic of\nconfrontation and of the division between poor and rich\ncountries with the logic of cooperation, shared\nresponsibility and solidarity inspired by justice as the\ngolden rule of multilateralism.\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II summed up this\nposition perfectly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations, when, addressing this same\nAssembly, he urged us to unite our efforts to build a\ncivilization of love, founded on the universal values of\npeace, solidarity, justice and liberty, to overcome the fear\nwhich darkens human existence at the end of the\ntwentieth century.\nWe firmly believe that the Charter and all the\ninstitutions of the international system must promote\ndynamic cooperation, each enriching the shared universal\nheritage with its own particular character.\nThe United Nations must not be merely a forum for\nthe sovereign expression of States. It must be the place\nfor negotiation and synthesis in the political, cultural,\nsocial and economic life of the nations.\nIt is reassuring to see that the grand designs that\ninspired the Charter remain valid. It is now our task to\nmaintain them and to interpret the new situations that\narise in the course of history.\nWe know, for example, that conflicts within States\nare conceptually different from the old wars between\nStates. We have a greater understanding of the link\nbetween peace and development and of the way in which\npolitics and socioeconomic interests are related. We\nbelieve that it is appropriate to consolidate a minimum\ninternational order and to replace violence and terrorism\nwith peace and coexistence, which should then thrive\nnaturally through multilateralism.\nColombia encourages the efforts undertaken in arms\ncontrol, with the systematic quest for disarmament as the\nultimate goal, and supports the priority allocation of world\nand regional resources to development. We believe that it\nis therefore essential to make progress in the control and\ngradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction and\nto exercise effective control over the illegal arms trade, to\nwhich thousands of men, women and children fall victim\ndaily throughout the world, and especially in the\ndeveloping countries.\nWe need a realistic and methodical strategy to secure\npeace in our time and in the coming century. We need to\npromote monitoring mechanisms for treaty compliance,\nthe negotiated solution of conflicts and the creation of\nnuclear-free zones with effective verification systems. In\nthis respect, the United Nations will need to perfect early-\nwarning systems to evaluate events so that its actions will\nbe efficient and genuinely preventive.\nI have come here today to reaffirm Colombia\u2019s\nunbroken tradition as a nation devoted to the great\n4\n\n\nprinciples that underpin the very existence of the United\nNations. We are prepared to offer, with thoughtful\noptimism, our support for the achievement of its purposes\nand its reforms. We believe it would be useful to review\nand appraise the results of the various summits held in\nrecent years, so that we may follow up their results and\nplans of action. This will serve both as a gauge of their\neffectiveness and as the central element of the analysis of\nthe coordination of the various institutions of the United\nNations system as a whole.\nOur people rightly demand more effective action and\nless empty rhetoric. We cannot betray billions of human\nbeings who yearn for a world at peace, with democracy and\nfreedom, and above all just, united and equitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We feel the greatest solidarity with them and\nurge the international community quickly and generously to\nprovide them with emergency assistance to deal with this\ncrisis.\nWe would like to extend to you, Sir, our sincere\ncongratulations on your election to preside over this session\nof the General Assembly. We are particularly delighted by\nyour election, as we enjoy excellent relations of friendship\nand cooperation with your country.\nWe would also like to extend our thanks to your\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his work in\npromoting the objectives of the United Nations,\nparticularly in the area of encouraging reform of this\nOrganization.\nWe extend our thanks to the Secretary-General for\nhis excellent work in discharge of his mandate in an\nextremely complex international situation in which a great\nvariety of interests are represented.\nThis will be my last participation here as President\nof the Republic of El Salvador, and I should therefore\nlike to reiterate our appreciation to this Organization for\nhaving been a decisive factor in the signing and\nverification of the Peace Accords that ended the armed\nconflict in El Salvador.\nFrom the beginning of our Administration, we\ndeclared our political will and our Government?s\ncommitment to comply fully with the Peace Accords, and\nwe are pleased to say we have done so, despite the\ndifficulties and obstacles encountered along the way.\nWe can say that profound transformations have taken\nplace in El Salvador, resulting in the replacement of\nauthoritarianism, abuse of power and impunity by a\nsystem founded on strict respect for the law and the\nprinciples and values of democracy.\n\n\nThe restoration of peace and the consolidation of\ndemocracy have enabled the state of law in El Salvador to\nbe strengthened, guaranteeing full independence for the\nbasic organs of the Government of our Republic, as well as\nrespect for the rights of the individual. We have also been\nable to proceed with a strategy of economic and social\ndevelopment with emphasis on the eradication of the\nunderlying causes of poverty.\nEl Salvador now has a solid economy that is growing\nprogressively and is internationally recognized and trusted.\nWe are carrying out a successful plan for modernizing the\ncountry, seeking greater efficiency, productivity and\ncompetitiveness; one important component of this approach\nis the elimination of State monopolies through the\nprivatization of such sectors as energy, telecommunications\nand social security.\nWe are implementing an economic policy of\npromoting our exports and attracting foreign investment,\nwith a view to stimulating production, creating more jobs\nand making better use of the opening of international\nmarkets.\nWe have focused on programmes for promoting\nhuman resources and the progress of communities,\nespecially in the neediest and most vulnerable sectors of\nsociety. To this end, we have allocated increasing\npercentages of our national budget to education, health and\nhousing. As part of our strategy for fighting against\npoverty, the National Department for the Family is carrying\nout support programmes for women, children and the\nelderly.\nBecause we attach great importance to the ecology, we\nhave established a Ministry of the Environment and Natural\nResources and we have now adopted a special law on this\nissue, in the aim of seeking solutions to the serious\nenvironmental problems facing our country and the world.\nWe are pleased to report that currently we are carrying\nout consultations across the country on the conclusion of a\ndraft basic agreement for a national plan, involving the\ngeneral agreement of all the various representative sectors\nof El Salvador?s society. Our greatest hope is that the\nnational plan will encourage participation by all Salvadoran\nmen and women in a common long-term undertaking in\nwhich the interests of all are intertwined, without\ndistinctions or political or ideological conditions, and which\nwill be established as the nation?s second great political\nagreement, after the Peace Accords.\nEl Salvador fully supports Central American\nintegration, and along with the other Governments and\nprivate sectors in the region we are updating our legal\ninstruments and strengthening the institutions that make\nup this system of regional integration.\nFrom a multilateral perspective, we can say that we\nhave participated in and supported the declarations and\nplans of action adopted at international summits and\nconferences, responsibly shouldering our commitments in\nthe areas of environment, human rights, social issues,\ndevelopment of women, rights of the child, population\nand the fight against drug abuse, inter alia.\nThe profound changes that have taken place in\nrecent years have had a strong impact on the international\nsystem, including the United Nations, resulting in\nagreement on the need for restructuring so as to respond\nproperly to and solve global problems, particularly those\nof the developing countries.\nWe believe that Member States must join forces, act\nin solidarity with each other, shoulder their\nresponsibilities and reach agreements to promote the\nchanges that are needed in the United Nations so that it\ncan fully discharge its mandate.\nWe support implementation of the Secretary-\nGeneral?s proposals to complete the restructuring of the\nSecretariat, and we advocate a change in attitude so that\nthere can be real reform in the Security Council and the\nEconomic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies.\nWe need a Security Council that is more transparent,\ndemocratic and representative, so that it can enjoy the\nsupport of all Members of the Organization, and\naccordingly can become more effective in adopting\npractical and efficient measures to prevent and resolve\nconflicts.\nWe are pleased that progress has been made in the\npolitical situation worldwide, but we must express our\nconcern over the fragile state of peace and stability in\nsome parts of the world as a result of continuing conflict,\nfailure to implement agreements, deadlocks and possible\nbreakdowns in peace processes, acts of terrorism, hostility\nand lack of trust among States.\nWe are concerned about the deadlock in the peace\nprocess in the Middle East, and we urge the parties to\nseek a swift solution in accordance with the agreements\nmade.\n2\n\n\nThe Preamble to the Charter states that the peoples of\nthe United Nations are resolved to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to unite their\nstrength for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Unfortunately, not all Member States are\nconvinced of this or ready to put into practice these ideas\nso as to achieve the objectives that are of concern to us all.\nThe recent nuclear tests run counter to our efforts to\nachieve a world free from nuclear weapons. We have\nsupported every initiative to ensure a safer world for our\npeoples, and, in a spirit of international solidarity, I am\npleased to report that earlier this month El Salvador\ndeposited its instrument of ratification on the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWe believe that terrorism in any of its manifestations\nis an affront to the civilized principles of the human race\nand constitutes criminal conduct, which we strongly\ncondemn and which cannot be justified on political,\nideological, philosophical, ethnic or religious grounds. We\naccordingly condemn the terrorist attacks in Kenya,\nTanzania, South Africa and Northern Ireland, which took\ninnocent lives, wounded thousands and destroyed property.\nThat is why we support Security Council resolution\n1189 (1998), which calls on all States and international\ninstitutions to cooperate with and provide support and\nassistance to investigations with a view to bringing to\njustice those who planned and carried out those\nreprehensible acts.\nThe Government of El Salvador recognizes and\nsupports the efforts of the international community strongly\nto fight against drug abuse. We reaffirm our commitment\nmade in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug\nDemand Reduction and in the measures to enhance\ninternational cooperation, which we adopted during the\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to the\ndrugs problem last June.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action will be important\nmilestones providing an opportunity for us to think about\nthe progress made and the effective enjoyment of\nfundamental freedoms. They also provide an opportunity for\nevery State to renew its commitment to comply with the\nobligations it has entered into, as part of the international\nlegal machinery that protects and promotes these rights.\nEl Salvador reaffirms its support for the restoration\nof the rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan as a\nState Member of this Organization because we believe it\nis a matter of justice to respect the sovereign will and\naspirations of its people in accordance with the principle\nof universality enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nThe changes that have occurred in the international\narena since the end of the cold war have not narrowed the\ngap between the developed and developing countries \u2014\nrather, the gap has become wider. The globalization,\nliberalization and interdependence that characterize the\nnew international order are challenges and opportunities\nof which many of our countries cannot take proper\nadvantage because of the constraints we face. Integrating\ninto the competitive world requires resources, technology\nand financing that go well beyond the national capacities\nof the least developed countries. This situation can be\novercome only with the participation of the countries that\nare better developed.\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, the\nSecretary-General said again that the volume of external\nassistance to the developing countries has declined\nsteadily during the current decade, and much of what is\ngiven is not appropriate for or aimed at the needs of the\nrecipient countries. El Salvador urges donor countries to\ntry to increase their cooperation for development, and\nparticularly urges the industrialized countries to facilitate\naccess to their markets for products from less developed\ncountries.\nThe great advances made in recent times in all areas\nof human knowledge highlight the need to make more of\nan effort to resolve the basic problems facing the majority\nof the world?s population. If we truly wish to have a\nworld free from poverty, war, drugs, crime, terrorism and\nenvironmental degradation, we must join forces so that\ntogether we can find new mechanisms and new paths of\naction that lead us to a swift solution to the problems and\nconcerns of our peoples.\nWe appeal for the wisdom and help of the gods of\nthe nations to ensure that in all corners of the earth peace,\nharmony, solidarity and progress will reign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "My delegation would like first\nof all to congratulate the President on his assumption of\nthe presidency for this session. We know full well that\nthe tasks that lie ahead are indeed challenging, but we are\nconfident that with his vast experience and wisdom he\nwill discharge his responsibilities successfully. Whilst we\nwish him luck, let me also reassure him of the full\ncooperation of our delegation at all times.\nIn the same vein, we would also like to congratulate\nhis predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the\nadmirable manner in which he conducted the activities of\nthe Assembly during the fifty-second session.\nMy delegation is very proud of Mr. Kofi Annan, our\nable Secretary-General, for the efficient manner in which\nhe has been running the affairs of our Organization. His\nimpressive contributions in the field of preventive\ndiplomacy, as amply demonstrated on numerous\noccasions, are worthy of praise. Likewise, in the delicate\nbusiness of reforms he is equal to the task, for no sooner\ndid he assume office than he embarked on the reform of\nthe United Nations. His success is our success, and\ntherefore we will lend him our full support in our\ncommon endeavour to revitalize the Organization and\nmake it more relevant to the realities of these changing\ntimes.\nWe in the Gambia have also been busy with the\ntransformation of our own society under the dynamic and\nenlightened leadership of President Yahya A. J. J.\nJammeh, whose ideal it is to serve the youth and people\nof Africa by endeavouring to help them to realize their\n23\n\n\naspirations for peace, stability and justice and progress in\nsocio-economic development. Since we renewed our new\ndemocratic tradition, every effort is being made to\nconsolidate this process in an orderly way, mindful of the\nfact that better and lasting results will be achieved only\nthrough a systematic approach.\nMoreover, cultivating democracy in the midst of\npoverty is not an easy task because democracy is, after all,\nabout participation. If the basic needs of the people are not\nsatisfied, they are simply not interested in any political\nprocess. Conscious of this hard reality, the Government of\nPresident Jammeh quickly put in place a programme of\nsocio-economic development to empower the people and\ntheir families, placing great emphasis on social sectors such\nas health, education and agriculture. In this way, an\nimpressive number of schools have been built around the\ncountry, and now we can boast of providing schools for all\ncommunities in the Gambia. Health facilities are within\nreach of all Gambians and are also affordable.\nMay I at this juncture, on behalf of my Government,\nexpress our most sincere gratitude to the Governments of\nthose friendly States \u2014 in particular, the Federal Republic\nof Nigeria, Cuba, Egypt and the Republic of China on\nTaiwan \u2014 for the medical assistance they continue to give\nus during these times of need. This is a meaningful SouthSouth cooperation worthy of emulation.\nI am only attempting to share our perception of what\ninter-State relations should be: caring, sharing, consulting\nand cooperating for the mutual benefit of all. I cannot think\nof a better way of cooperation between States for mutual\neconomic development in a world in which the gap between\nthe rich and the poor continues to expand. Now, whilst we\nare concerned with bridging this gap, we are overwhelmed\nby another hurricane-like phenomenon, called globalization\nand liberalization.\nGlobalization and liberalization were recognized by\nmany to hold many attractions. They were perceived to be\nthe gateway to the integration of developing countries into\nthe global economy. We however observe that while they\nare yielding ample benefits for developed countries, they\nhave further widened the gap between developed and\ndeveloping countries, as well as the inequality gap between\nrich and poor. Their impact on employment and socioeconomic development in general has been largely negative.\nWe are concerned at this growing marginalization of\nthe least developed countries in world trade. The volume of\nour total exports continues to be under 0.4 per cent of\nglobal exports. Increased globalization is further\nworsening the situation. This negative trend merits\ncoordinated action to alleviate the situation. In this\ncontext, we welcome the General Assembly\u2019s decision to\nhold the first high-level dialogue for two days earlier this\nmonth on the theme of the social and economic impact of\nglobalization and interdependence and their policy\nimplications. We hope that this meeting will have brought\nabout active engagement of both developed and\ndeveloping countries, in a spirit of genuine partnership,\nwith a view to reaching a meaningful and successful\nconclusion and strengthening international economic\ncooperation for development. Globalization and\nliberalization must be managed through concerted\ninternational effort in order to avoid the further\nmarginalization of developing countries.\nThe overwhelming burden of external debt today\nposes one of the most challenging and daunting problems\nfor developing countries. Much has been said about this,\nand very little has been done to alleviate the problem. We\nbelieve that there is a dire need for new financial flows to\ndebtor developing countries, in addition to debt relief\nmeasures that include cancellation and concessional\nfinancial assistance to enable developing countries to\nreduce their debt overhang.\nIn this context, we welcome the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Initiative and encourage early and urgent\napplication of its measures. We would also encourage any\nrefinements of the initiative to reduce the structural\nadjustment period to three years, to increase the debt\nreduction level to 90 per cent and to ease the terms for\nreduction of multilateral debt.\nThe least developed countries have always received\nthe attention and support of the international community,\nparticularly with the adoption of the Paris Declaration and\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s. The realization of the primary objectives of\nthe Programme \u2014 to arrest and reverse the deterioration\nin the socio-economic conditions in the least developed\ncountries \u2014 so far remains elusive. The lack of progress\nin this regard is attributable in the main to the failure of\nthe international community to fulfil its commitments. We\nhope that the declaration of the ministers of least\ndeveloped countries at this year\u2019s session will encourage\nour development partners to come forward and work with\nus in a genuine partnership.\nPoverty, deprivation and environmental degradation\nare the greatest evils facing developing countries today.\n24\n\n\nWe agree with the analysis of the Secretary-General in his\nreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa, in\nparticular with regard to the interrelationship between\ndevelopment and peace.\nToday, the world is besieged with conflicts, both interand intra-State. From the Balkans to the Great Lakes\nregion, human beings continue to prey on one another with\nguns and knives, machetes and all other sorts of weapons.\nUnfortunately, women and children suffer the most from\nthese conflicts. We cannot continue to allow this to go on.\nThe time has come when people have to take individual\nresponsibility for crimes they have committed against\nhumankind. Ethnic violence and human rights abuses, a\ncommon feature of present day conflicts, cannot be\ncountenanced and cannot be committed with impunity.\nMy delegation supports fully the resolve of the\ninternational community to deal with the problem, and in\nthis context welcomes the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court. We share the philosophy of Benjamin B.\nFerencz, a former Nuremberg prosecutor, that\n\u201cthere can be no peace without justice, no justice\nwithout law, and no meaningful law without a court to\ndecide what is just and lawful under any given\ncircumstances\u201d.\nThe establishment of the International Criminal Court\nwill ensure that henceforth humanity\u2019s response to crimes\nagainst humanity will be swift and will be just. Henceforth,\nno army, no ruler, no junta anywhere can abuse human\nrights with impunity. The people and the Government of\nthe Gambia look forward to the coming into effect of the\nstatute of the International Criminal Court.\nOne of the most cherished aspirations of our\nOrganization is to ensure that all men live in peace. The\nattainment of international peace and security therefore\nremains one of the most vital preoccupations of our noble\nOrganization. It is for these reasons that my delegation\njoins the rest of the international community in supporting\nthe efforts of the United Nations to ensure peace and the\nresolution of conflicts around the world.\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to\ncommend the members of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and its Military Observer\nGroup (ECOMOG) and other regional and subregional\narrangements in Africa and beyond for the good work they\ncontinue to do in their bid to ensure peace and security. My\ndelegation is particularly thankful to ECOWAS for the\nrestoration on 10 March 1998 of the legitimate and\nconstitutionally elected Government of Sierra Leone. We\nare still concerned that the rebels have up to this moment\nrefused to lay down their arms. We urge the international\ncommunity to assist the Government of Sierra Leone in\nits effort to restore control over all its territory and to\nconcentrate its energies on national reconciliation,\nreconstruction and economic development. In this regard,\nmy delegation welcomed the holding of the Special\nConference on Sierra Leone that was held here in New\nYork at the initiative of the Secretary-General and which\nwe hope will contribute to the process of national\nreconciliation.\nIn neighbouring Guinea-Bissau, we hope that the\njoint peace initiative of ECOWAS and the Community of\nPortuguese Language Countries will bear fruit, leading to\na final settlement of the dispute. In this context, we\nrecognize the need to respect the ceasefire agreed upon in\nPraia, Cape Verde, on 26 August 1998, which we\nconsider to be an important step in enhancing peace and\nsecurity in the West African subregion.\nThe Government of the Gambia is concerned over\nthe number, intensity and interrelationship among\nconflicts in Africa, and especially at the emergence of\nnew conflicts during the past year. The border conflict\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, the resurgence of conflict\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the impasse in\nthe peace process in Angola, the continued violence by\nthe rebels in Sierra Leone, and the complex humanitarian\nemergencies in Guinea-Bissau, Somalia and Sudan,\namong other problems, cause grave concern to us.\nIn addition to what I have just said, we are also\nconcerned at the difficulties attendant upon the present\nconflict situations in Africa, in particular human rights\nabuses, refugee outflows and the humanitarian needs of\ninnocent persons affected by such conflicts, in particular\nwomen and children. The international community, in\nresponding to these conflict situations, must address these\nissues and the root causes of the conflicts, including in\nparticular the troubling issues of children in armed\nconflict and the flow of small arms. In this context, my\ndelegation welcomes the actions taken by the Security\nCouncil to address these issues following the report of the\nSecretary-General on Africa. We hope that there will be\na United Nations-wide approach to tackle these important\nissues.\n25\n\n\nThe Lockerbie issue has dragged on for too long. It is\nabout time that a settlement was reached so that the people\nof the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya can be relieved of the\nbite of the excruciating sanctions imposed against them. In\naccordance with the position taken by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, the League of\nArab States and other regional organizations, the\nGovernment of the Gambia welcomes the concurrence of\nthe Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United\nStates of America to the proposal to have the two\nLockerbie suspects tried in a neutral country, the\nNetherlands. Consequently, the Government of the Gambia\nreaffirms its full support for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in\nits bid to secure a fair and just trial for the two suspects.\nIn the light of the recent developments, in the quest to\nalleviate the immense suffering caused by the economic\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan nation by Security Council\nresolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993), and to avert any\nfurther tightening of sanctions on the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya, the Government of the Gambia is desirous of\nthe urgent finalization of the arrangements for a lasting\nsolution to this long-drawn-out problem.\nFollowing a review, therefore, of the latest\ncorrespondence on the matter between the Governments of\nthe United Kingdom and the United States of America and\nthe Secretary-General, and the agreement concluded\nbetween those two countries and the Government of the\nNetherlands relating to arrangements for the transfer of the\nsuspects to the Netherlands and their trial there, the\nGovernment of the Gambia is of the view that the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya must be given the opportunity to make an\nassessment of those documents in order to ensure that its\nviews and concerns are fully taken into consideration with\nregard to the final arrangements.\nWhilst acknowledging the great lengths that all parties\nhave gone to in order to ensure that justice is meted out \u2014\nand this at the earliest possible opportunity \u2014 my country\nfirmly believes that Libya should have a greater input into\nthe final arrangements regarding the hand-over of the two\nLockerbie suspects and, most important, that the appropriate\nguarantees for a just and fair dispensation of justice should\nprevail. This would be in the spirit of the decision taken in\nOuagadougou by the heads of State of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity at their last summit.\nMy Government would like to see justice done and the\nreal culprits in the Lockerbie bombing identified and\nbrought to trial very quickly. However, whilst we persist in\nurging that Libya be associated fully in the quest for\nmutually acceptable conditions of transfer of the two\nsuspects to the Netherlands and trial there, we will also\ninsist on the need to have all the proof of their direct\ninvolvement in this tragic affair being provided to us in\nthe first place. As soon as a reasonable and acceptable\nterrain d\u2019entente is reached, the sanctions must be lifted\nimmediately and unconditionally.\nThe Gambia\u2019s foreign policy is directed by its\nnational interest and that of the continent, as well as by\nthe quest for peace and justice in the world. As members\nof the Security Council, we are obliged to ask some\npertinent questions when certain actions and initiatives\nhave a devastating impact on the lives of human beings.\nOne such issue for which we would want straightforward\nand clear answers relates to the recent bombing by the\nGovernment of the United States of a pharmaceutical\ncomplex in Khartoum.\nWhat my Government seeks to know in this respect\nis whether, assuming in good faith that the complex was\nindeed involved in the production of deadly and\nprohibited substances, the Government of the United\nStates fully weighed the consequences of such a terrible\nstrike on the innocent people of the Sudan before\nsanctioning the bombings. In other words, in the view of\nthe United States Government, did the satisfaction derived\nfrom the destruction of the complex in the Sudan\noutweigh the value and premium placed on the lives of\ninnocent men, women and children on the scales of their\nmoral values? This matter has to be investigated so that\nthe international community\u2019s conscience may be at\npeace.\nAbout the Middle East, we are disappointed that the\npeace process, which gave so much hope, has virtually\ncollapsed. This undesirable state of affairs does not\ndiminish our faith in the peace process. We recognize the\nright of all peoples to self-determination. We therefore\nrespect the rights of the Palestinian people to emerge fully\nas an independent sovereign State. In this context, we\nwelcome the adoption by the General Assembly of\nresolution 52/250 on the participation of Palestine in the\nwork of the United Nations. We look forward to the day\nwhen Palestine joins the ranks of other States as a fully\nfledged Member of the United Nations.\nIt is the wholehearted belief of my delegation that\nevery people has a right to self-determination. This belief\ninspires the Gambia\u2019s strong support for the aspirations of\nthe 21.3 million people of the Republic of China on\n26\n\n\nTaiwan to exercise their right to share and participate in the\nactivities of the United Nations. The legitimacy of their\naspirations, both legal and moral, has been reinforced by\nsimilar actions and measures taken by the United Nations\non the issue of parallel representation, which now stands as\na useful reminder.\nWe believe, in the same vein, that the people of Cuba\nhave an inalienable right to determine their destiny. The\npractice of unilateral imposition of sanctions by one\nMember State against another should end with the demise\nof the cold war. As we enter the new millennium, all States\nshould be committed to shaping a better world, a world\nwherein all States, big or small, are equal, a world in which\nrelations between States are based on mutual respect and\nstrict observance of international law.\nThe situation between Iraq and Kuwait continues to be\none of the most important issues before the United Nations.\nWe would wish to stress the need to have this matter\nresolved expeditiously. We hope that those who have\ninfluence on Iraq will be able to secure its compliance with\nits international obligations and that it will resume\ncooperation with the United Nations and its bodies.\nIn this respect, we urge the release of all prisoners of\nwar, including missing Kuwaiti nationals and third country\nnationals. We encourage sincere cooperation with the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross for that purpose.\nWe also call for the return of the properties of the\nGovernment of Kuwait, including official documents\nremoved from their national archives.\nMy delegation is also concerned about the\nhumanitarian situation in Iraq and the dire plight of the\nIraqi people. We encourage Iraq to cooperate fully with the\nUnited Nations, which would end the present logjam and\npave the way for a comprehensive review of the sanctions.\nAll of us remain concerned about the ongoing conflict\nin Afghanistan. We believe that there is no military solution\nto the conflict there. We urge all Afghan factions to find a\npolitical settlement to the conflict, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, which addresses all the interests and\nconcerns of all the people of Afghanistan.\nLet me at this juncture reiterate my Government\u2019s\ncondemnation of the killing of Iranian diplomats in\nAfghanistan. We hope that the perpetrators of this heinous\ncrime will be pursued and brought to justice.\nAs we approach the new millennium, we are\nconfronted with long-drawn-out conflicts and new ones\nthat are emerging. Our world is thus far from being a\npeaceful and quiet place. At this stage in our history, we\nmust all strive to enter the twenty-first century as a\nunited, peaceful family that can proudly bequeath to\nfuture generations a developed, secure world where\ndemocracy, justice and equality are guaranteed to\neveryone, irrespective of origin, race, religion or political\npersuasion. We hope that the Proclamation of the year\n2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace,\nwhich was first suggested by the Gambia during the 1997\nsession, will bear fruitful results.\nApart from the numerous conflicts, old and new, my\ndelegation is also concerned about the drug menace,\nwhich threatens the very fabric of our societies. This\nproblem has now assumed monumental proportions,\nleaving no society safe from its lethal and tenacious\ntentacles.\nWe believe that all of us have a stake in this\nproblem \u2014 big and small States alike. We must therefore\njoin forces as a common front in our battle against this\nevil. The Government of the Gambia is committed to\ncurbing the problem of drugs in its territory and will\ncontinue to cooperate with all countries in that regard.\nThe Government of the Gambia welcomed the\ntwentieth special session of the General Assembly on the\nworld drug problem held in New York from 8 to 10 June\n1998. We also fully support the Political Declaration, the\nDeclaration of the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand\nReduction and the action plans adopted at the special\nsession.\nWe wish to reiterate our concern for the growing\nand dangerous links between terrorist groups, drugtraffickers and their paramilitary gangs, which have\nresorted to all types of violence, thereby undermining the\ndemocratic institutions of States and violating human\nrights.\nIn addition to the drug menace, the international\ncommunity is faced with another challenge: international\nterrorism. The Government of the Gambia condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. While we\nagain extend our sympathy to the injured and to the\nfamilies bereaved as a result of the recent bombings in\nKenya, Tanzania and South Africa, we call on all\ncountries to work together to fight against the scourge of\nterrorism.\n27\n\n\nThe issue of anti-personnel landmines and its attendant\nconsequences is of concern. My delegation welcomes the\ncoming into force of the Ottawa treaty banning antipersonnel landmines.\nWith the end of the cold war, nuclear disarmament\nshould be given priority in our efforts to ensure the safety\nof humankind. In this context, my delegation is encouraged\nby what India and Pakistan said about signing the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We join those\nwho call for a negotiated and phased programme for the\ncomplete elimination, by all countries, of nuclear weapons.\nIn order for us all to enter into the new millennium\nwith our collective vision for a better world, we will\nobviously need to reform and revitalize our Organization to\nmake it more relevant and more responsive to the\nchallenges of contemporary times. This idea has indeed\ntaken hold, leading to the consideration of reform measures\nproposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: A programme for reform\u201d.\nMay I take this opportunity to pay tribute to our able\nSecretary-General for his unswerving commitment to the\nreform of our Organization and his cooperation in this\nregard. It is our fervent hope that the success of any reform\nprogramme for the United Nations will be judged by the\nability of the Organization to make a significant impact on\nthe lives of all people, in particular those of the developing\ncountries, as well as by real improvements in its\nfunctioning.\nIn this context, we feel very strongly that reform\nmeasures should focus mainly on strengthening the role of\nthe Organization in the promotion of peace and\ndevelopment. Any such reform programme should address\nthe need to enable the Organization to meet the challenges\nof modern times and preserve the sanctity and centrality of\nthe principles of the Charter.\nThe last session witnessed a lot of debate on this\nissue. It is sad to note, however, that no substantial progress\nhas been made. As we pursue this important task, we hope\nthat the Assembly will defeat the hostile offensive which\nseeks to portray it as a \u201chouse of words\u201d. Any concrete and\nworkable decisions that may evolve out of our deliberations\non this issue will serve as the litmus test of the political\nwill of the membership to forge ahead with genuine\nrenewal and revitalization of the Organization.\nNo reform of the United Nations would be complete\nwithout the reform of the Security Council \u2014 the main\norgan responsible for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. While some consensus has emerged\non a number of issues on the question of equitable\nrepresentation and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, important differences still exist on many\nother issues. We urge Member States to continue to\nnegotiate constructively on the outstanding issues with a\nview to arriving at a compromise that is agreeable, if not\nsatisfactory, to all.\nFinally, as we continue to grapple with the reform of\nthe United Nations and its organs after 50 years of\noperation, so must we also continue to address the\nweaknesses, inequalities and inadequacies that plague the\ninternational economic and social system, global trade,\nfinance, investment, international development, and so on.\nWe must continue to do this so as to achieve more\nmeaningful cooperation and partnership geared towards\nthe promotion of socio-economic development and the\npreservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\nfor all.\nIt therefore bears recalling that the important issues\nof women in development and the rights of the child\nshould continue to be at the top of the international\nagenda. In this endeavour, development must be given the\npriority it deserves. Africa, Asia and Latin America must\nbe given the opportunity to emerge from their devastating\npast into a future which guarantees for them all the\nbenefits of democracy and peace, respect for human\nrights, development and the restoration of the dignity of\nall their peoples.\nThis objective is realizable if we all work together,\ndrawing inspiration from the Charter of the United\nNations. North and South, rich and poor, together we can\ndo it \u2014 if we believe in it.\nThe United Nations provides the forum and the\nnecessary framework to achieve the objectives that we set\nfor ourselves on this small planet that we share. Before\nthe United Nations was founded, the world experienced\nbitterly two devastating wars. When the United Nations\nwas founded half a century ago, it helped to avoid another\nglobal war despite the cold war that ensued. Today, in\nthis post-cold-war era in which we are confronted with\nlocalized ethnic and internal political strife, we need the\nUnited Nations more than ever before.\nThis world body has withstood the test of time and\nhistory. There is no alternative to the United Nations;\ncountries big and small, rich or poor, all have a vital\n28\n\n\nstake in strengthening the United Nations rather than\nweakening it. The United Nations is more relevant today\nthan it has ever been, and we all should strive for its\nvitality and the respect of its decisions. We can do this only\nwhen it is clear in the minds of all that it is the common\nhouse of all the States of the world and that it should be\nperceived as being just and fair to all, in particular in the\nresolutions adopted by its Security Council. These\nresolutions should always be in the spirit of fraternal\ncooperation and understanding that prevail here in this\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\nWe in the Gambia remain very optimistic, and we\nknow we share this optimism because the General\nAssembly is the asylum of humanity at large against the\ncruelty and pain of the outer world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the\noutset to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nUruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. This\ndecision, to which Georgia acceded with pleasure, is a\nfitting recognition of Uruguay\u2019s high international\nauthority and a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Opertti\u2019s\npersonal qualities and profound experience.\nAt the same time, I am honoured to have the\nopportunity to express my gratitude to the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for his significant\ncontributions to the successful outcome of the previous\nsession.\nToday, as the second millennium is coming to a\nclose, an inevitable question pops up: What will the next,\nthe third, millennium be like? Indeed, for the first time\nsince the end of the global stand-off, the opportunity has\nemerged to create a qualitatively new world order based\n14\n\n\nupon the comprehensive development of free and\nindependent States. Allow me to share our observations on\nsome of the important issues that we face.\nWe have repeatedly underscored the threat to global\nstability posed by the spread of the disease of aggressive\nseparatism and the ineffectiveness of our joint efforts to\ncope with it. For five years now, the conflict in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia, has been on the agendas of a number of\ninternational forums. The need to resolve this conflict\nwithin the framework of the territorial integrity of Georgia\nand to ensure the speedy return of hundreds of thousands of\nrefugees and displaced persons has been reiterated more\nthan once. However, we have to admit that real progress\ntowards the settlement of this conflict has not been\naccomplished.\nMoreover, in May 1998, as a result of the punitive\noperation carried out by the Abkhaz side in the Gali region\nof Abkhazia, Georgia, more than 60 civilians were killed,\nabout 1,400 houses burned and over 40,000 peaceful\ncivilians expelled once again from their land. The vigorous\nefforts of the Georgian Government at that point averted\nfull-scale confrontation and bloodshed.\nThe tragedy in the Gali region was preceded by the\nunfulfilled resolutions of the Security Council and by\ndecisions on the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of the Georgian\npopulation in Abkhazia, Georgia, adopted at the Budapest\nand Lisbon summits of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thus, we are once again\nconfronted by the acute problem of the implementation of\ndecisions taken by the international community.\nThe Government of Georgia remains committed to a\npeaceful solution of the conflict and applies only political\nmeans, to which there is no reasonable alternative. In order\nto add new impetus to the peace process, we have\nwelcomed the creation and development of the Geneva\nprocess, under the auspices of the United Nations and with\nthe participation of the Russian Federation as facilitator, the\nFriends of the Secretary-General and the OSCE. More\nactive work should be conducted in the framework of the\nGeneva process on the question of the political status of\nAbkhazia within the Georgian State.\nIn our view, it is urgent to fully resume the\nfunctioning of the United Nations Observer Mission in\nGeorgia and, in accordance with its mandate, to ensure the\nfreedom of its activities.\nThe matter of utmost importance is the safety of\nUNOMIG personnel in the conflict zone. Their\nvulnerability was again proved by the recent armed attack\nagainst four members of UNOMIG in Sukhumi.\nIn this regard, we wish to emphasize the importance\nof the proposal of the Secretary-General concerning the\ndeployment of self-protection units. Unfortunately, this\nquestion has turned into a subject of endless discussion.\nIndeed, it is unclear how the deployment of a self-\nprotection unit would contradict the interests of any of the\nparties to the conflict or any other State, when this step\nis intended only to facilitate UNOMIG\u2019s intensive\nmonitoring and would contribute to peace in the region.\nWhile categorically condemning terrorist acts,\nregardless of the motives or where these acts might come\nfrom, we support the creation of joint investigative teams\nwith clearly defined mandates of action.\nThe turn of events in Abkhazia, Georgia, has shown\nthat some important aspects should be touched upon. First\namong these is the development of economic programmes\nof post-conflict peace-building to promote the peace\nprocess. We already have an example of the successful\nimplementation of such an approach in the settlement of\nthe Georgian-Ossetian conflict. The implementation of the\neconomic programme in close cooperation with the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) has brought about the realization of\na number of important projects for the reconstruction of\nthe social and economic infrastructure in the conflict zone\nand, most importantly, has activated the mechanism of the\nreturn of refugees to their homes. Recently, we have\nembarked upon the implementation of the subsequent\nstage of the programme, which has been financed by the\nEuropean Union.\nSecondly, for the success of the peace process, we\ndeem it necessary to formulate and effectively implement\nconfidence-building measures between the parties to the\nconflict. To this end, and for the implementation of the\nmeasures formulated and the coordination of work in this\ndirection, we believe it would be reasonable to actively\nengage the joint United Nations-Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe Human Rights Office in\nSukhumi.\nThe third aspect is the grave humanitarian situation\nexisting in internal conflicts, such as the one in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia. I refer to the fate of hundreds of thousands of\n15\n\n\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. We regret that\nthe rights of the internally displaced persons are not\nprotected by an international act.\nPresident Shevardnadze has called upon the world\ncommunity to mark 1998, the year of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nby elaborating a comprehensive plan for the creation of an\neffective international mechanism for the protection of the\nrights of internally displaced persons throughout the world,\nincluding their political rights, the right to protect their\nproperty and the right to return to their homes. In this\nregard, we actively support the proposal of the Secretary-\nGeneral concerning the creation of an organizational\nstructure for the protection of the rights of displaced\npersons.\nWhen discussing the creation of a global model of\nsecurity for the twenty-first century, we have to admit that\nthe post-confrontational world is not yet secure, and the\nproblem of separatism is not the only threat against which\nwe have to consolidate our efforts.\nWe cannot but express our concern over the expansion\nof the zone of nuclear proliferation. The nuclear tests in\nSouth Asia have clearly made this threat far more ominous.\nTherefore, we call upon all States to display goodwill and\na commitment to peace, and to join the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nEfforts to quell the hotbeds of the so-called local\nconflicts have so far been unsuccessful. Georgia is deeply\nconcerned at the developments in Kosovo, and especially in\nthe north Caucasus region, namely, in Chechnya, Dagestan\nand across the border of North Ossetia and Ingushetia.\nTerrorism, with all its bloody manifestations, poses a\nthreat both to the region and to the world as a whole.\nUnfortunately, Georgia has also had its fair share of\nterrorism. The assassination attempt against the President of\nGeorgia was aimed at the destabilization of the country and\nof the entire region. These and the recent terrorist acts\nagainst the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania\nrequire an intensification in the fight against terrorism.\nTherefore, we must actively support any efforts to do away\nwith this evil.\nAs we usher in the next millennium, it is impossible\nnot to touch upon the problems of economic development\nand economic security. The process of economic\nglobalization raises the question of a new role for the\nUnited Nations as a universal institution which would\neffectively contribute to the development of national\neconomies and ensure economic security at both the\nregional and the global level.\nAll this is especially urgent for the post-Communist\ncountries with economies in transition. Since restoring its\nstatehood in 1991, Georgia has been on a difficult road,\nhaving gone from chaos to stability and from total\neconomic collapse to development. This became possible\nthrough democratic change and economic reforms.\nWe have come to believe that the successful\ntransition of the newly independent States to the market\neconomy depends entirely on their integration into the\ninternational economic system through regional and\ninterregional cooperation. A clear example of the\nimplementation of a large-scale programme of economic\ncooperation is the revival of historic Silk Road. The\nSummit of the Transport Corridor: Europe-Caucasia-Asia\n(TRACECA) member States, held recently at Baku,\nAzerbaijan, emphasized that the idea of an alternative\nroadway for the Central Asian region through the south\nCaucasian corridor has already turned into a significant\nsystem stretching across the whole Euro-Asian continent.\nThe economic cooperation of the Black Sea basin\ncountries is also very important. This area was recently\ntransformed into a regional economic organization, having\nimpressive potential and far-reaching plans.\nIn the course of the formation of a new world order,\nthe main responsibility for international peace and\nsecurity rests with the United Nations. An important step\nwould be the reform of the Security Council in\naccordance with the new geopolitical realities. In this\nregard, we reiterate our position concerning the inclusion\nof Germany and Japan among the permanent members of\nthe Council. We also support the increase in the number\nof non-permanent seats, providing one for the States of\nthe Eastern European region. We also advocate more\ntransparency in the work of the Security Council,\nincluding participation in its closed meetings by those\nnon-member States whose problems happen to be the\nsubject of the Council\u2019s discussions.\nWe are aware of the importance the United Nations\nattaches to the timely contributions of its Member States.\nIn this regard, despite its economic constraints, Georgia\nwill do everything in its capacity to cover its indebtedness\nto the Organization.\n16\n\n\nSpecial attention should be accorded to the further\ndevelopment of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nWe believe that the time has come to further develop\nand institutionalize the system of standby arrangements.\nThe creation of the Multinational United Nations Standby\nForces High-Readiness Brigade can play an important role\nin preserving the peace. The same is true of the\nestablishment of a well-equipped headquarters from which\nto identify potential hotbeds of tension.\nGeorgia has always advocated the establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court and actively participated in the\nRome Conference. We believe that the establishment of this\npermanent jurisdictional body will ensure that gross\nviolations of human rights and crimes against humanity no\nlonger go unpunished.\nLike many previous speakers, in my statement I have\nresorted to such expressions as \u201cnew challenges\u201d and \u201cnew\nthreats\u201d in the post-confrontational world. But at the same\ntime, the new era opens before us new and boundless\nhorizons and creates new opportunities in the formation of\na new world order. We believe that only by joint efforts\nand common political will can we cope with these\nchallenges and realize all these opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to express my sincere congratulations\nto Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session. As much as\nhis election reflects the esteem in which he personally is\nheld, it is also reflects our appreciation of the positive role\nplayed by his country, Uruguay, in the international arena.\nI am confident that his presidency will be an effective\nfactor in achieving the objectives to which the\ninternational community today aspires.\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey to\nHis Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, President of\nthe Assembly at its fifty-second session, our appreciation\nand esteem for having conducted the Assembly?s work\neffectively, wisely and objectively.\nI am also pleased to express my appreciation and\nesteem to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, who is managing the affairs of the international\nOrganization with high competence and experience, and\nwho is making continuous efforts and persistent\nendeavours to achieve peace and security in today?s\nworld, which continues to face many kinds of conflicts\nand various forms of crises and challenges.\nA hundred years ago this year, the late King Abdul\nAziz Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud began the initial stages\nof rebuilding and uniting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on\nthe principles of tolerant Islamic beliefs. In that process\nof unification, the late King Abdul Aziz was also laying\nthe groundwork of a modern State which combines, on\nthe one hand, adherence to Islam as a belief, a system and\na way of life and, on the other hand, advanced forms of\ndevelopment and modernization. Since then, the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia, which adheres to the religion of Islam,\nhas played a significant international role, because it\nfollows a foreign policy which conforms to the\nfundamental principles of the United Nations and with the\nnoble objectives for which the Charter was formulated.\nThese are in accordance with Islamic law in matters\npertaining to the conduct of relations between States. The\neternal message of Islam unites and does not divide,\nestablishes justice and does not inflict injustice, promotes\nequality and does not discriminate. It urges everyone to\nwork and cooperate to propagate these sublime principles\nand to achieve security, peace and prosperity for all\nhumanity.\nAbiding by these principles, the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia, since its establishment, has continued to believe\nin constructive dialogue and peaceful coexistence among\nnations and peoples. It endeavours to cooperate and to\nrespect the principles of international law and\ninternational legitimacy, it rejects violence and terrorism\nin any shape or form, and it does not interfere in the\naffairs of others or allow others to interfere in its own\naffairs.\n10\n\n\nOn the basis of the same principle, the Government of\nthe Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin\nAbdul-Aziz Al-Saud, is intent on performing its role in the\ninternational arena in such a way as to assist in creating the\nmost favourable conditions for realizing the aspirations of\nthe international community to security, peace, stability and\nprosperity.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proud that it was one\nof the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter,\nwhich founded the United Nations, and it is proud also that\nit constantly adheres to the principles and purposes of that\nCharter. It also consistently endeavours to put these\nprinciples and purposes into practice. On the basis of those\nconsiderations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms that\nit earnestly supports the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies, for it views the Organization as a viable\nframework for cooperation among nations and peoples, an\nimportant forum for dialogue and understanding, and an\neffective means to settle disputes and defuse crises.\nMy Government wishes to emphasize a basic fact: the\nability of the Organization to play all its roles and to carry\nout all those tasks depends on the political will to put those\nCharter principles and provisions into practical effect.\nIn this regard, my Government is well aware of the\nimportance of modernizing the United Nations agencies to\nenable them to play their required role, and on a level that\nenables them to deal with the new developments in modern\ninternational relations. The Security Council, which bears\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security, remains the focus of the various reform\nproposals that have been put forward. In this regard, my\ncountry?s point of view has been based on a deep\nconviction that any restructuring of the Security Council\nmust be aimed at improving the Council?s ability to\nperform its role effectively, in accordance with the Charter,\nand at making more active in implementing its resolutions\nand in dealing with international crises. The Council must\nalso cooperate with the General Assembly in a manner that\nachieves the required harmony and the desired objectivity.\nAs we seek greater cooperation, we have to look to\nthe lessons of history to identify the obstacles which the\nUnited Nations has faced and which have hindered it from\nenhancing the cooperation that has become a requirement\nfor peace, stability and growth. We have to hold the\ncountries which base their international relations on\nprinciples that contradict the Charter basically responsible\nfor creating those obstacles, and to make use of the means\ncontained in the Charter to oppose such practices. Insistence\non violating the principles of the Charter and refusal to\ncomply with the resolutions of the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council signal a blatant challenge to the\nCharter, which we must firmly confront in a manner that\nis consistent with its provisions and purposes.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in line with its\nobjective of achieving peace, security and stability in the\nMiddle East, has supported the peace process from the\nvery beginning and participated as an observer in the\nMadrid Conference. It has also participated actively in the\nmultilateral negotiations, and will continue to support the\npeace process in its international activities and contacts.\nIn addition, the Arab countries, in conformity with\nthe conclusions of the Arab Summit held in Cairo in June\n1996, have unanimously adopted a firm position\nstipulating that peace is a strategic Arab option. This\naffirms that there has been no Arab retreat from that firm\nposition.\nWhat is regrettable, and a cause of grave concern, is\nthat, after a glimmer of hope for peace in the region and\nafter the optimistic feelings that peace was possible, the\npeace process \u2014 which started in Madrid on the basis of\nthe principles of international legitimacy, United Nations\nresolutions and the principle of land for peace \u2014 has\nsuffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the present\nIsraeli Government. This Government has endeavoured to\npursue policies that are based on retreating from the\nprinciples of the peace process endorsed by the Madrid\nConference, as well as from the agreements signed with\nthe Palestinian National Authority, and it continues to\nrefuse to resume negotiations with Syria at the point that\nhad been reached previously.\nIn striving to destroy the peace process, the Israeli\nGovernment has continued to build settlements on\nPalestinian lands in order to alter their character and\ncreate new realities. It is also adopting a policy of\nJudaizing Holy Jerusalem by planting more settlements in\nand around it, as well as annexing areas with Jewish\nsettlers and emptying Jerusalem of its Arab residents. It\nalso enacted a law to enlarge the municipality of Holy\nJerusalem to include neighbouring settlements so as to\npreempt the negotiations on the final status of Holy Jerusalem.\nThese Israeli practices have resulted in aborting the\nefforts of the international community to achieve a just\nand comprehensive peace based on Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the land-\nfor-peace principle. Such practices have led the peace\n11\n\n\nprocess down a dead-end road. What we perceive of the\nbehaviour of the present Israeli Government does not make\nus optimistic about the possibility of achieving the peace\nwhich the peoples of the region aspire to unless these\npractices are met by firm measures to compel Israel to\ncompletely implement its agreements with the Palestinians,\nrespect the principles on which the peace process was\nfounded and enter into serious negotiations with the\nPalestinian Authority, with Syria and with Lebanon. We\nurge the international community, and the United States of\nAmerica in particular, to continue making all possible\nefforts to save the peace process and to act resolutely to\nstop Israeli tampering with the most sensitive issue in the\npeace process \u2014 Jerusalem, which should be dealt with on\nthe basis of its being the most important case in the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. Adhering to the rules of international\nlegitimacy and fulfilling commitments is the best way to\nachieve peace and security.\nIf the present Israeli Government is serious in its\nefforts to achieve peace with the Palestinian side, all it has\nto do is to affirm its adherence to the provisions of the\nsigned agreements and resume the negotiations on the\nunresolved issues. If the Israeli Government intends to\nachieve a state of mutual security with its neighbour, Syria,\nthe Syrian Government has spared no effort in declaring its\nreadiness to resume negotiations with Israel from the point\nat which such negotiations had stopped. As for tension and\nthe cycle of violence in southern Lebanon, its end is\ncontingent upon immediate Israeli withdrawal from that part\nof Lebanon and the western Bekaa valley in accordance\nwith Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\nThe position of the Government of the Custodian of\nthe Two Holy Mosques towards Iraq has two fundamental\nbases: first, guaranteeing the comprehensive, total,\nindivisible and non-selective compliance by the Iraqi\nGovernment with the resolutions of international legitimacy;\nand secondly, insuring the preservation of the independence,\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, as well as\nalleviating the sufferings of the Iraqi people.\nOur feelings of pain and sorrow for the sufferings of\nthe brotherly Iraqi people, because of the hard conditions\nwhich they endure, contribute to our insistence on Iraqi\ncompliance with all relevant international resolutions in\norder to get the sanctions lifted. In this context, it is with\ndeep sadness that we received the news of the Iraqi\nGovernment?s decision not to cooperate with the United\nNations Special Commission established by the Security\nCouncil. This will result in the continuation of sanctions on\nIraq. We call upon the Iraqi Government to annul that\ndecision, and we stress that the quickest means for lifting\nthe sanctions is faithful and meticulous responsiveness, in\nletter and spirit, to the requirements of the Security\nCouncil resolutions. The Iraqi Government should stop\nthe policies of prevarication and delay aiming at impeding\nthe implementation of these resolutions, especially those\nconcerning the release of prisoners and detainees, the\nreturn of property, commitment to a modality for\ncompensation and full cooperation with the efforts of the\nUnited Nations Special Commission to eliminate weapons\nof mass destruction.\nSaudi Arabia and its sisters, the members of the Gulf\nCooperation Council, place great importance on the\nbettering of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nWe have been particularly pleased at the recent positive\nindicators from the Iranian Government which could have\na positive impact on Iranian-Gulf relations and on the\nclimate of peace and stability in the region. In this\nconnection, we welcome the positive implications \u2014\nregarding both Gulf-Iranian relations and the issue of\narmaments in the statement by President Mohammad\nKhatami before the General Assembly last week. We look\nforward to resolving the outstanding problems between\nthe two sides \u2014 foremost among which is the issue of the\nthree United Arab Emirates islands, Greater Tunb, Lesser\nTunb and Abu Musa \u2014 by peaceful means, in accordance\nwith the principles of international law, including the\noption of referring the matter to the International Court of\nJustice.\nWe also express our concern regarding the current\ntension between Iran and Afghanistan. We call upon these\ntwo countries to exercise restraint and resolve their\ndispute by peaceful means.\nThe continuing fighting in Afghanistan during all\nthese years is a cause of sadness and sorrow. Saudi\nArabia has done all it could since the beginning of the\nfighting to stop the bloodshed and to restore peace and\nsecurity to Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference to stop the fighting. At the same time, we\nstrongly deplore the manipulation of the present situation\nof Afghanistan to make it a haven for the sheltering and\ntraining of terrorists, which destabilizes security and\nbrings further suffering to the Afghani people.\nShortly after the Serbs terminated their aggression\nagainst the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they\nignited the flames of a new war, aiming this time at our\nbrothers in Kosovo. The Serb forces are daily committing\n12\n\n\nin Kosovo the same inhuman practices which they\nperpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including ethnic\ncleansing, coerced deportation, terror and oppression in full\nview of the whole world. It would be truly tragic if silence\nin the face of these appalling actions was to continue over\nthis long duration. Therefore we call upon the international\ncommunity to shoulder its responsibilities by promptly\ntaking all requisite measures to put an end to these\npractices.\nTerrorism, which is striking every corner of the world\nmercilessly and indiscriminately, has become a very serious\ninternational phenomenon and requires an international\neffort to combat it. The Government of Saudi Arabia has\nregularly condemned terrorism and has joined its efforts to\nother international efforts to confront it with all possible\neffectiveness. We stress in particular that terrorism and\nviolence are universal phenomena rather than the\ncharacteristics of a certain people, race or religion.\nPrecisely because of the comprehensiveness and\nuniversality of terrorism, the only way to combat it is\nthrough unified international action within the framework\nof the United Nations, with a view to ensuring an end to\nterrorism, saving the lives of the innocent and preserving\nthe independence and sovereignty of States. But combating\nterrorism would also require international cooperation\nagainst sheltering terrorist elements and groups and\npreventing them from exploiting the territories and laws of\nthe States in whose territories they live in order to practice\ntheir destructive activities, regardless of any pretexts.\nThe conflict in Jammu and Kashmir remains a threat\nto peace and security in South Asia. We call for finding a\npeaceful solution to this problem in accordance with the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and for allowing the\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise directly their\nlegitimate right to self-determination.\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy\nMosques pays maximum attention to the ongoing efforts to\neliminate weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East,\nincluding the Arabian Gulf region. This is undertaken\nthrough its support of the efforts of the League of Arab\nStates in accordance with the resolution adopted by the\nLeague?s Council during its 101st session which called for\nmaking this sensitive part of the world a zone free of all\nweapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical and\nbiological.\nWe are greatly concerned by Israel?s refusal to accede\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). Israel thus keeps its nuclear programmes outside the\nambit of international inspection, which constitutes a\nserious threat to the region?s security and stability. While\nwe completely reject the international community?s\ndouble standard that allows Israel an exception from\nnuclear disarmament efforts and thus encourages the arms\nrace, we also express our concern at the nuclear tests\ncarried out in South Asia, begun by India and followed by\nPakistan, in view of the dangers these tests present to the\nsecurity and peace of the region.\nWhile believing there is urgent need to increase the\neffectiveness of the NPT through the activation and\nuniversalization of the system of guarantees of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), we also\nconsider it of the utmost importance to establish controls\nand criteria that would assist in achieving the desired\nprogress in all fields of disarming weapons of mass\ndestruction, in conformity with General Assembly\nresolution 1 (I) of 1946. In this context, we urge all States\nthat have not yet done so to take the necessary steps as\nearly as possible to accede to the NPT and place their\nnuclear installations under the international safeguards\nregime, thereby contributing to international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers\nenvironmental issues and environmental protection of key\nimportance, to the degree that it has assigned to them a\nprominent place in our domestic and foreign policies. We\nbelieve that a decent life for mankind is directly\nconnected with environmental and climatic conditions.\nTherefore, the Kingdom has effectively participated in all\nrelevant conferences, forums and international\norganizations concerned with environmental protection. In\naddition, we have become a party to several regional and\ninternational agreements relevant to this issue.\nWe only hope that international efforts relating to\nthe problems of the environment will be characterized by\nthe necessary degree of balance and of objectivity, as\nbased on serious and rational studies and buttressed by\nscientific facts that take into account the needs of\ndevelopment in the developing world. In this regard, we\ncall upon all States to abide by Agenda 21. We also urge\nthe industrial States in particular to live up to their\nobligations regarding the transfer of environmental\ntechnology to developing countries.\nThe emerging forces of globalization and their\nseemingly rampant nature which cause geographic,\npolitical and sovereignty barriers to recede, force upon us\nthe need to tame and channel these energies. Therefore,\n13\n\n\nwe are now called upon more than at any other time before\nnot to confront this phenomenon, but to act cohesively in\nits formulation, in conformity with our religious beliefs, our\ncultural and civilizational values, and in the interests of our\npeoples. This should also be accomplished in a manner that\nwould accord with the diversity and pluralism of social and\npolitical systems that have prevailed after the bipolarism of\nthe cold war. The objective would be to build a balanced\nworld based on mutual interest, reciprocity of advantages\nand equality of opportunity to live free from fear, secure\nfrom hunger and poverty. It would be a world in which\nprinciples of justice, prosperity and peace predominate.\nIt is important to stress, in this regard, that the\nprinciples of free world economies and open markets are\nnot an end in themselves. They are but a means to growing\nthe economies through the increase and expansion of\nexports. The developing countries cannot attain these\nobjectives without greater flexibility in the varying\nopportunities afforded to them in the form of human\nresources, infrastructure, and financial, administrative and\nprocedural regulations. Consequently, the developing\ncountries are required more than ever before to intensify\ntheir internal development efforts in order to be integrated\nin the international economy. This calls for closer\ncooperation in international fora in order to deal with the\nissues of development and to draft a considered and\ncomprehensive agenda that fulfils the ambitions and\naspirations of the peoples of developing countries within the\nframework of the new economic order.\nIn this context, we cannot ignore the important role\nthat needs to be played by the developed countries, who\nmust fulfil their international commitments to the\ndeveloping and less developed countries either by direct or\nindirect aid as well as through cancellation and rescheduling\nof foreign debt. Developed countries must also allow free\nand easy access to their markets for the exports of\ndeveloping countries and must refrain from adopting unjust\ntrade measures that impede the flow of such exports to their\nmarkets.\nIn this regard, it must be noted that the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia has been very keen on contributing, within the\nlimits of its means, to the development of developing\ncountries, whether at the bilateral or multilateral levels.\nBecause of its desire to participate in the efforts to achieve\na better future for the international economy, Saudi Arabia\nhas applied for membership in the World Trade\nOrganization. God willing, and with the support of friendly\ncountries, we hope to finalize the accession procedures as\nsoon as possible.\nThe issues just mentioned, with their political,\neconomic, security and social dimensions, confirm the\nneed for our Organization to assume its role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to\nrealize the aspirations of all peoples to live in security\nand enjoy stability and prosperity. Our firm belief in the\nrole that the United Nations can play in dealing with\ncrises, as well as our efforts to avoid the horrors of war\nand to prepare for international cooperation, make us\nmore determined than ever to support this Organization\nand emphasize its constructive role. The United Nations\nmust have a larger role in dealing with crises before they\noccur by exercising preventive diplomacy in order to\nmaintain stability and preserve international peace and\nsecurity. We have great hopes that the Organization will\ncontinue its march towards these goals with strong steps\nand firm determination.\nI cannot find more suitable words to end my\nstatement than this verse from the Holy Quran:\n\u201cWork, soon Allah will observe your work, and His\nMessenger, and the Believers.\u201d (The Holy Quran,\nIX:105)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "This year we are\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I should like\ntherefore to congratulate Mr. Opertti very warmly upon his\nelection to the presidency of this session. Finland will give\nhim its full support in his demanding task.\nFinland aligns itself with the statement made by my\nAustrian colleague, Mr. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00bcssel, on behalf of\nthe European Union.\nAs has been mentioned in other statements, one of the\ncatchwords of our time is globalization. We all should be\nready to contribute to a constructive international dialogue\naiming at improving the joint global responses to the\nvarious challenges emanating from this globalization.\nWe have also done a lot. The United Nations has in\nthe 1990s convened global conferences to enhance\ndevelopment in the fields of human rights, sustainable\nenvironmental development, population policies, social\ndevelopment, the advancement of women, food security,\nhuman settlements and the rights of the child.\nThese conferences have set an ambitious global agenda\nto which Governments are committed. These commitments\nform a road map which guides the Governments, non-\ngovernmental organizations and individuals as well as the\nUnited Nations system. The question remains: can the\nUnited Nations deliver? Do we, the Member States, want\nour Organization to be able to deliver? And do we make it\nour own responsibility to realize our commitments? Then\nand only then can the United Nations deliver.\nAnd are we also able to see good partners?\nDemocratic Member States and free, capable citizens and\ntheir organizations form a good basis for an international\nnetwork of safety in the world of globalization.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been\nand is the basis for developing human rights. We should\ncommemorate the Declaration in the daily activities of our\nGovernments and common international institutions.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has emphasized that human\nrights are the basis for sustainable human development and\nfor the sustainability of any community. I subscribe to his\nwords and endorse his objective of knitting human rights\ninto all United Nations activities. Adequate resources\nshould be secured for this process.\nThe universal nature of human rights should be\nbeyond question and doubt. All women, men and children\nwho enjoy or are demanding those rights are equal\nregardless of their nationality or cultural identity.\nThis year, human rights are being made more widely\nand better known because there are still women, men and\nchildren who are not aware of their rights. Yet\nconsciousness of one\u00e2s rights is the basis for the rule of\nlaw, democracy, good governance and full enjoyment of\nhuman rights. Awareness-raising is the key to concrete\nresults in the field of human rights.\nThe Criminal Court will become an effective\nmechanism for the trial of war criminals, as well as a real\ndeterrent against genocide, crimes against humanity and\nwar crimes. It is particularly important that the Court\nmake sure also that those individuals who are responsible\nfor atrocities in connection with internal conflicts will be\nbrought to justice.\nIt is important that special provisions for the\nprotection of women and children were included in the\ndefinition of war crimes and crimes against humanity as\nwell as elsewhere in the Statute. The Criminal Court\nshould keep this in mind in its everyday work. As the\nexperience of the two ad hoc tribunals shows, special\nexpertise is needed for that purpose.\nIn this connection, let me emphasize that Finland\nalso strongly supports the finalization of an optional\nprotocol on children in armed conflicts based on an age\nlimit of 18 years. The suffering inflicted on children by\nconflicts is intolerable. It is high time to act.\nWe have once again been reminded that terrorism\nconstitutes a growing threat to human beings, internal and\ninternational security and the functioning of democratic\ninstitutions. Within the framework of the United Nations,\nimportant work has been done in the fight against\nterrorism. A sustainable response to terrorism can be\nfound only through intensified efforts within the United\nNations and improved operational cooperation between\nStates. In this regard, I want to stress that the fight\nagainst terrorism should be carried out in accordance with\nrelevant international instruments, including those related\nto human rights.\nFinland calls for ratification and full implementation\nof the international conventions on the suppression of\nterrorism and an early finalization and acceptance of the\nconvention on the suppression of acts of nuclear\nterrorism.\n25\n\n\nAnother way to secure our global neighbourhood is to\ncontinue disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The\nongoing efforts of the international community were\nchallenged by the nuclear test explosions by India and\nPakistan. Finland deplored these actions. Now it is\nimportant to prevent a nuclear arms race in South Asia. We\ncall on India and Pakistan to confirm their promises not to\ntest again through adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The CTBT remains a strong and\ndynamic cornerstone of the global security system. It serves\nthe interests of all States.\nFinland welcomes the agreement to begin negotiations\nat the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning the\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons. A cap on\nthe production of fissile material will serve both nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\nConventional weapons are increasingly included in\ndisarmament efforts. Finland warmly welcomes this\ndevelopment. In several conflict areas, the accumulation of\nweapons is threatening the very existence of nations. We\nwelcome the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on\nanti-personnel landmines following the fortieth ratification\nlast week.\nThe issue of small arms is acute. Readily available and\neasy to use, small arms are the main tools of violence in\ntoday\u00e2s conflicts. The world community needs to respond\nto the problem of small arms through both enhanced global\nand regional cooperation. Member States need to control\ntheir exports and other transfers of small arms. But that is\nnot enough. An integrated approach involving measures\naddressing both security and development of societies is\nrequired. Finland supports a lead role for the United\nNations on the issue of small arms. We look forward to the\nrecommendations next year by the United Nations panel on\nsmall arms.\nOn the opening day of this session due tribute was\npaid to the women and men who have served during the\npast 50 years in United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nThe Organization has a unique role in peacekeeping.\nFinland reiterates its firm support and commitment to this\nessential function of the United Nations in global collective\nsecurity. The world needs the peacekeeping and peace-\nbuilding capability of the United Nations. We have to\nstrengthen the capacity of the Organization in these fields.\nFinland calls upon Member States to secure financing for\nthis purpose.\nAttacks against unarmed United Nations personnel\nand humanitarian workers are increasing. This trend has\nto be reversed. Parties to any conflict must respect\ninternational humanitarian law.\nWe have the global agenda, and the commitments\nare there. For implementation we need a strong United\nNations. The Secretary-General\u00e2s reform package must be\nimplemented without delay. The proposals for reform in\nthe economic and social sector need to be realized. It is\nalso high time to enter into real negotiations on the\nreform of the Security Council. All we need is political\nwill. The reform process must lead to a strengthened and\nmore efficient United Nations.\nFinland values the reforms undertaken by the\nSecretary General, Kofi Annan. We highly appreciate his\nleadership as the head of this Organization, and we\ncontinue to support him in his endeavours. Member States\nmust provide the United Nations with sufficient means.\nThey must fulfil their financial obligations towards the\nUnited Nations, in full, on time and without conditions.\nWithout a sound financial basis even the efforts at\nreforming the United Nations are bound to fail.\nFinland also calls for better cooperation and\ncoordination of development activities both within the\nUnited Nations system and between the United Nations\nand the Bretton Woods institutions. An efficient\nimplementation of the global agenda requires more\ncoherent approaches from the different actors in the field\nof development.\nToday\u00e2s global, regional and local problems have\ntheir economic, environmental and social dimensions. A\nlarge-scale problem of a developmental, ecological or\nhumanitarian nature may even turn into an armed conflict.\nIntertwined problems call for integrated responses. We\nhave good examples of integrated approaches in southern\nAfrica, as well as in Guatemala and in El Salvador. Peace\nagreements and operational agendas include agreements\non human rights, identity and the rights of indigenous\npeople, social and economic aspects and strengthening of\ncivilian power, as well as defining the role of the armed\nforces. Constitutional reforms and electoral regimes are\nalso essential, as is monitoring of the functioning of the\ncourts as a prerequisite for the reform of judicial systems.\nWe also see the importance of good governance.\nWe must secure the future of the United Nations, in\nterms not only of finance but of political support as well.\nHere Governments and the Organization can benefit from\n26\n\n\npublic interest in the United Nations. We attach high\nexpectations to the Millennium Assembly and to the role\nand participation of civil society in the Millennium Forum.\nThe Forum can give us guidance from all sectors of our\nsocieties on which way to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the high office of President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session and to\nassure you of the full support of the delegation of\nKazakhstan in your work.\nKazakhstan, in welcoming the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations, supports\nthe decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its last\nsession. The steps taken in that direction will undoubtedly\nfacilitate the renewal of the Organization in the changing\nhistorical conditions.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, the\nworld is becoming an integrated and interrelated system\nin which there is no room for autarchy and self-isolation.\nGlobalization, which embraces the main spheres of human\nactivity, has radically altered the accustomed assumptions\nabout the realities of modern life. Globalization also\ncompels us to reassess the nature of international\ncooperation from the standpoint of strengthening\nmultilateral mechanisms for taking decisions on the urgent\nproblems that are of concern to the entire world\n17\n\n\ncommunity. Despite all the diversity of national interests,\nsuch decisions need to be taken through joint efforts on the\nbasis of goodwill and consensus, and here the role of the\nUnited Nations cannot be underestimated.\nOn the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, we again note the permanent\nsignificance of that instrument in affirming democratic\nvalues and the rule of law.\nKazakhstan, seven years after making its choice of\ndemocracy and an open society, is today taking tangible\nsteps to intensify its political reforms. Our country is\nembarking on a comprehensive programme of\ndemocratization that covers such important spheres as\nelections, political parties, Parliament, civil society, the\njudicial system, the advancement of women and the mass\nmedia. The President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan\nNazarbaev, will be taking decisive steps to solve acute\nsocial problems, combat corruption and optimize the State\nadministration.\nAll these measures are aimed at further protecting and\nguaranteeing the rights and freedoms of every citizen of our\nmulti-ethnic society. We shall do everything within our\npower to preserve such values as inter-ethnic harmony and\nthe diversity of the cultures and customs of each of the\nnationalities that make up the people of Kazakhstan. We\nshall strengthen pluralism in society in order reliably to\nguarantee the freedoms of conscience, speech and the press\nand further to strengthen the foundations of a secular\ndemocratic society.\nKazakhstan does not believe that it is possible to build\nits own statehood without successful integration into the\nworld economy and world politics. In this context, we are\ndeveloping and strengthening our national financial\ninstitutions, which has enabled us to cope, at lower cost,\nwith the consequences of the crisis affecting Asia and the\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS).\nAs a proponent of a policy of integration, our head of\nState is a constant advocate of creating the appropriate\neconomic conditions for this to take place and has\nproposed, as Chairman of the Customs Union, the\nconclusion of a treaty on the creation of a unified economic\nspace within the CIS.\nKazakhstan, which pursues a policy of constructive\ncooperation, has created a zone of security and goodneighbourliness around its borders. We are not in\nconfrontation with any State in the world. As a Eurasian\nState, Kazakhstan sees the development of friendly,\nequitable and mutually beneficial relations with the\ncountries of the East and the West as a priority of its\nforeign policy.\nWe believe that Kazakhstan\u2019s voluntary renunciation\nof its nuclear heritage and its firm adherence to the nonproliferation regime constitute important prerequisites for\nthe attainment of this strategic objective. A few days ago,\nthe second International Conference on the problems of\nnon-proliferation was held in the town of Kurchatov,\nwhich is within the territory of the former nuclear testingground at Semipalatinsk. During the conference, the last\nstrategic missile launch silo was shut down.\nKazakhstan consistently advocates the creation of\nsecurity structures on the Asian continent. We note with\nsatisfaction that the initiative of our country\u2019s President to\nconvene a conference on interaction and confidencebuilding measures in Asia is taking solid shape and\nbecoming a tangible factor in present-day international\nlife. This is attested to by the meeting which took place\nin Almaty in July of the leaders of Kazakhstan, China, the\nRussian Federation, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on issues\nof cooperation and confidence-building measures in the\nregion. We believe that the agreements signed with China\non the delimitation of the Kazakh-Chinese border will\nmake a major contribution to strengthening regional\nsecurity and stability. The Kazakh-Russian Declaration on\neternal friendship and alliance for the twenty-first century\nand the Treaty of eternal friendship between Kazakhstan,\nUzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are also of great importance.\nKazakhstan, as a firm proponent of strengthening\nregional and global security, strongly condemns any\nundermining of the non-proliferation regime and calls on\nIndia and Pakistan to heed the views of the vast majority\nof the world community and accede without delay to the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support\nthe call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for\nthose countries to join in the negotiations on prohibitions\nof the production of fissionable materials for nuclear\nweapons and to refrain from deploying such weapons in\ntheir territory. In the context of strengthening regional\nsecurity and the non-proliferation regime, Kazakhstan will\ncontinue to work for the creation of a nuclear-weaponfree zone in Central Asia.\nThe demonstrations of our country\u2019s involvement in\nthe peacekeeping activities of the United Nations include\n18\n\n\nthe formation of a peacekeeping battalion in Central Asia\nand Kazakhstan\u2019s participation in the United Nations standby arrangements system.\nFrom this high podium, we cannot fail to pay attention\nto the current situation in Afghanistan. The events taking\nplace there, which are accompanied by mass violations of\nhuman rights and the fundamental norms of international\nlaw, have become a subject of profound concern to us.\nKazakhstan has made and will continue to make its\ncontribution to the achievement of peace in that country.\nThe task of the world community is to convince all the\nparties to the conflict to cease military action right away\nand sit down at the negotiating table with a view to\nestablishing a Government of national reconciliation. We\nare convinced that no military solution to the Afghan\nproblem exists. A peace process in Afghanistan is possible\nonly if interference from outside is halted and full support\nis given to the efforts of the Secretary-General. Not only\nimmediate neighbours, but all interested countries, must\ntake an active part in the search for ways of solving the\nAfghan problem.\nOne of the most difficult present-day problems is\ninternational terrorism and organized crime. Kazakhstan\nrejects terrorism in all its manifestations and is ready to\nparticipate in international efforts to combat this evil. On\nthe threshold of the next century, a handful of madmen\ncannot be allowed to blackmail and endanger the lives and\nwell-being of people who uphold the ideas of creation and\npeace. This is doubly dangerous in the case of nuclear\nterrorism.\nInternational organized crime is associated in one way\nor another with illegal drug-trafficking. Most unfortunately,\nthe scale of the drug business is constantly growing. Drug\naddiction, moving freely across borders, is undermining\nstatehood and the moral foundations of society.\nIncreasingly, more young people are becoming addicted to\ndrugs. We are witnessing a new phenomenon of drug\nproduction becoming a leading component of national\neconomies. Drugs from Afghanistan are to be found in\nvirtually all countries of the world. Accordingly, we support\nthe decisions of the twentieth special session of the General\nAssembly on international drug control and will participate\nactively in their implementation.\nIn speaking of the main problems that ail mankind, we\ncannot forget separatism. Kazakhstan has more than once\nstated its position that it does not accept ethnic separatism.\nGiven the calamities it is inflicting on many States, now is\nthe time to declare unambiguously that separatism must be\nproclaimed outside the law. The right of nations to selfdetermination cannot under present historical\ncircumstances play the role that it played at the beginning\nof this century.\nYet another global problem which casts a cloud over\nthe future of mankind is the ever deteriorating\nenvironmental situation. Kazakhstan has in all truth\nexperienced the consequences of environmental disasters.\nFrom this high podium, the President of Kazakhstan has\nmore than once called on the world community to unify\nand coordinate efforts to protect the environment. We are\ngrateful to the General Assembly for the support that has\nbeen extended to our country, as reflected in the\nresolution on assistance in overcoming the consequences\nof the nuclear tests in the Semipalatinsk region.\nThe Aral Sea disaster has become genuinely global\nin nature. Deposits of salt from the exposed bed of the\nAral Sea have been found in the Arctic Ocean and in\nWestern Europe. While noting with gratitude the\nassistance from the United Nations, we nevertheless call\non the States Members of our Organization to pay greater\nattention to this serious problem and to take more active\nand specific steps to solve it.\nThe peculiarity of the geographical situation of\nKazakhstan, and of Central Asia as a whole, confronts us\nwith an acute problem of access to world markets,\nincluding the transport of hydrocarbons. Kazakhstan\ntherefore attaches great importance to cooperation with\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies to develop\ntransit transport systems in the landlocked Central Asian\nStates.\nReviving the traditions of the Great Silk Road,\nKazakhstan is interested in expanding and developing\ntransportation networks in Central Asia and beyond. Our\ncountry, with its vast territory, is an important link\nbetween Asia and Europe. Our participation in the\nTransport Corridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA)\nproject will undoubtedly facilitate an increase in the\neffectiveness of the transport system in the vast area of\nthe Eurasian continent.\nWe place great hopes in the United Nations Special\nProgramme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA),\nrecently adopted by the Economic Commission for\nEurope and the Economic and Social Commission for\nAsia and the Pacific.\n19\n\n\nKazakhstan, as the Chairman of the Economic\nCooperation Organization (ECO), intends to make a real\ncontribution to stepping up the activity of this important\nregional forum. The Declaration and other documents\nadopted at the ECO summit in Almaty creates good\nprerequisites for the creation of a favourable trade climate\nin relations between the ECO member countries and their\npotential partners in Europe and Asia. We believe that ECO\nis a promising organization and has great potential for\nexpanding economic ties in the territories of 10 States with\na total population of more than 300 million people.\nKazakhstan will work for the further strengthening of\ncooperation between the ECO and the United Nations.\nAnother issue that must be included among today\u2019s\nurgent problems is the legal status of the Caspian Sea. We\nnote with satisfaction the progress made in reaching\nconsensus on this complex and delicate subject, which\naffects the interrelations among the five littoral States. The\nagreement signed between Kazakhstan and the Russian\nFederation in July this year on the delimitation of the\nnorthern part of the Caspian Sea lays the foundations for a\ncomplete settlement of the Caspian problem. It is now\nimportant to take concrete steps for the implementation of\nthis instrument, which is in conformity with the provisions\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nA solution of the Caspian problem is of strategic\nimportance for Kazakhstan. We are interested in reliably\nensuring the export of our mineral resources through\nmultiple-option oil-gas pipelines. We expect early\nimplementation of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium project,\nand we believe that the construction of an oil pipeline from\nwestern Kazakhstan to China offers promising prospects.\nWe support the trans-Caspian project for an oil and gas\npipeline, Baku-Ceyhan, and we view the project for an oil\npipeline through the territory of Iran as very promising.\nIt must be noted with regret that mankind will be\nentering the next century burdened by many serious\nproblems. But, at the same time, there are no grounds for\nunrelieved pessimism, since the passing century, which\nwitnessed two world wars, the development and testing of\nlethal types of weapons and a multiplicity of regional and\nethnic conflicts, has developed reliable mechanisms \u2014 our\nOrganization first among them \u2014 for preventing and\nsettling international problems. The cause of peace, security\nand development is of concern to all States. We must,\ntherefore, all act as a united whole. Kazakhstan is ready to\ntake part in this work for peace and cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Mr. President, to offer you my\nwarmest congratulations on your unanimous election to\nguide the work of the fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly. The honour bestowed upon you attests to the\ngood relations which your country, Uruguay, has forged\nover the decades with the nations that make up the\ninternational community. The noble task which awaits\nyou, far from being merely prestigious or simply one of\nprotocol, frequently proves to be both delicate and\ndifficult.\nIt involves presiding over the most eminent forum of\ndebate for world affairs during a period in which, in\nvarious places, one crisis follows another, such that\naround the world neither peace nor war prevails. I am\nconvinced that your talents as a diplomat, your passion\nfor peace and development and your enthusiasm will\n33\n\n\nserve you well in dealing with the most complex debates\nand the most tangled webs of procedure. Rest assured that\nour best wishes will be with you throughout this session,\nwhich, we feel sure, under your expert presidency, will be\ncrowned with success.\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, H. E.\nHennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the remarkable way in\nwhich he guided our work in the last session and for the\npersonal touch with which he ensured and improved\ncoordination between the main bodies of the United\nNations. We feel certain that in his parliamentary career in\nhis country he will display the same efficiency and skill he\nshowed in this forum. Finally, allow me to pay an emphatic\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who,\nthrough his tireless commitment, has been able to restore\nconfidence in our Organization and make it an\nincomparable instrument for international relations.\nI wish to hail his efforts to bring peace to the world,\nand particularly to Africa, and the special attention he gives\nto the economic and political situation on our continent. I\nalso wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of my\ndelegation, to congratulate him sincerely on his excellent\nreport on the work of the Organization, the clarity and\nconciseness of which will be very useful in inspiring our\ndebate during the fifty-third session.\nDuring the past year, the world has entered a phase of\ndifficulties and uncertainties such as it had not seen for\nalmost a decade. The crisis born in the most dynamic\neconomies of South-East Asia has gradually reached other\nregions. Today it seems to threaten all the countries of the\nplanet, from the richest to the poorest.\nThis shows very well the extent to which the\nphenomena of globalization and interdependence among\nStates and peoples have spread. No country, no matter how\nprosperous, can now hope to escape a crisis such as the one\nSouth-East Asia has suffered and continues to suffer which\nnow threatens other regions. This shows that the fight for\ndevelopment and the struggle against poverty concern all of\nus.\nEmergent economies, which are paying the price of a\ncrisis that, over these last months, has thrown tens of\nmillions of people back into poverty and insecurity, are\nintegral parts of a sort of a global economic and financial\npuzzle. The jolts these economies are experiencing weaken\nthe whole system.\nThis risk, which everyone can see is real, should\nlead us to reconsider our traditional notion of the division\nbetween countries of the North and of the South. We\nshould not, of course, ignore here the gulf between North\nand South or challenge the existence of the distinct forms\nof poverty that make for starkly different conditions of\nexistence, and even survival, for the most destitute\npeoples of the industrialized countries and those of the\ndeveloping countries.\nWhat, on the other hand, is more and more\nquestionable with the advance of globalization is the idea\nof a possible divergence of destinies, which could lead\nsome countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the wealthiest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to continue their\nmarch forward, while leaving the poor ones \u00e2\u20ac\u0153along the\nside of the road\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, to quote a popular phrase.\nThe crisis we have been witnessing for a year now\nshould convince us that there is a common destiny which\nbinds together all Governments and all peoples of the\nplanet. The latter, whether they are richer or poorer, are\nbound by the same necessity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that of progressing\ntogether along the path of development. The current crisis\nshows us another vital need \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that of solidarity, for\nwhich multilateral cooperation is the prime instrument.\nThe United Nations must once again become the natural\nvehicle of this multilateral cooperation. Unfortunately, we\nmust note that this notion of solidarity, which has become\nan agreed formula in official declarations, is acted upon\nless and less in any concrete way.\nWe recall the famous objective \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which a few\ndecades ago seemed quite modest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of establishing the\ndesirable level of official development assistance at 0.7\nper cent of gross national product of industrialized\ncountries. In noting, as the Secretary-General has done in\nhis report on the work of the Organization, that official\ndevelopment assistance has been steadily decreasing for\na decade and today represents only 0.22 per cent of the\ngross national product of industrialized countries, we must\nrecognize that this call for solidarity is reaching\nincreasingly deaf ears in international forums.\nAlong the same lines, I would like to stress that the\nstrategies for development debated and agreed among\nGovernments, as well as the decisions adopted at the\nmajor United Nations conferences, so far have not been\nimplemented to the desired extent, due to insufficient\nfinancing. The mid-term evaluation of the outcome of the\nRio Conference on Environment and Development was in\nthis respect quite revealing of the present financial limits\nfor aid to development. An effort commensurate with the\n34\n\n\nproblem would allow us to radically change its basic\nelements.\nThe 1998 Human Development Report, published by\nthe United Nations Development Programme a few weeks\nago, makes some significant comparisons. It shows, for\nexample, that Americans annually spend $8 billion on\ncosmetics \u00e2\u20ac\u201d $2 billion more than the amount needed to\nfinance basic education for a large part of the world\npopulation. To quote the Secretary-General\u00e2s report on the\nwork of the Organization,\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bridge must be constructed between, in effect, the\nDow Jones index and the human development index\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n(A/53/1, para. 15).\nWe expect also that a new drive towards cooperation\nand development will not only combat poverty and\nexclusion but also promote international peace and security.\nConflicts frequently have social and economic roots,\nand this dimension should be fully integrated into the\napproaches devised by the international community in the\nareas of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict\npeace-building.\nI wish to reiterate, and express the support of C\u00c3\u00b4te\nd\u00e2Ivoire for, the proposal made by the Secretary-General in\nparagraph 30 of his report on the work of the Organization\nto better use the possibilities of Article 65 of the Charter of\nthe United Nations, which provides that the Economic and\nSocial Council may furnish information to the Security\nCouncil upon a request from the latter.\nWith the exception of very limited applications in\n1949 and 1959, this provision of the Charter has not been\ninvoked. Because it is based on fraternity, dignity and\nequality between peoples and States, solidarity needs to be\nthe cardinal value in the new world that is emerging from\nthe ideological battlefields of the past.\nProgress in communications technology has today\nbrought people closer than ever. Stepping outside of their\nown cultures, men and women can experience the same\nevents at the very same moment. They are upset and\nshocked by the pictures and consequences of a natural\ndisaster or a terrorist attack. They are impassioned by the\nsame sports events and are reduced to tears by exceptional\nevents such as the liberation of Nelson Mandela or the fall\nof the Berlin Wall, which give true ethical significance to\nthe evolution of humankind.\nDuring the past decade, we have witnessed\nspectacular progress, in almost all countries, with respect\nto the positive values that cement solidarity between\npeoples. Almost all societies are now open and receptive\nto pluralism. Every day I see that the peoples of the\nAfrican continent are hungering for participation. They\nwish to have their say in national matters and to take their\nfuture into their own hands.\nThroughout the world, civil society is making its\nclaims and aspirations felt. Everywhere Governments, to\nvarying degrees, are becoming aware of this extraordinary\nchange and, in the context of diverse political formulas\nand variable schedules, they are acceding to the demands\nof the people with respect to democratization.\nThis new global focus on human rights and\npluralism is reflected increasingly in the international\norder. Buttressed by the non-governmental organizations,\nGovernments have decided to ban barbaric weapons such\nas anti-personnel landmines, whose principal victims are\ncivilians, especially children. The broad and massive\nsupport given by the international community to the\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction, which has been signed\nby 128 States and which will enter into force after the\ndeposit by the fortieth State of its instrument of\nratification, allows us to hope for success in the efforts\nundertaken to fight against another scourge \u00e2\u20ac\u201d small arms\nand small-calibre weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which affects mainly\ncivilians and foster criminality and insecurity.\nGlobal progress on the ethical level is evident also\nin the adoption in July 1998 of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, thus enshrining the progress\nbegun by the international criminal tribunals for the\nformer Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. In this respect, the\nfirst judgments, handed down on 2 September last, have\na dual significance. Fifty years after its adoption by the\nGeneral Assembly, the Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of Genocide has now seen a concrete\ncontinuance: the appalling crime of genocide, repeatedly\ncarried out since 1945, will no longer go unpunished. The\nsecond positive element of the judgments rendered by the\nArusha Tribunal is the recognition that sexual violence\ncommitted systematically and on a broad scale in the\ncontext of conflicts meets the definition of the crime of\ngenocide.\nAnother concern for my Government is the scourge\nof terrorism, a true hydra-headed menace that is blindly\n35\n\n\nattacking in places where we least expect it. It is no longer\nenough to forcefully condemn this evil; we must try to\nextirpate its roots as it stems, with rare exceptions, from\ninjustice or the intolerable humiliation of peoples. The fight\nagainst terrorism is first and foremost a fight against\ninjustice in all its forms. C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire reiterates its\nsympathy for those States that have fallen victim to bomb\nattacks. It reasserts its commitment to work in the context\nof cooperation with all States to eradicate these crimes,\nwhich cannot be justified regardless of their motivation.\nThe time has come, as was stated at the Non-Aligned\nMovement Summit in Durban, to convene an international\nconference dealing with all aspects of terrorism that would\nlead to a convention allowing us to eradicate this scourge.\nTo strengthen cooperation for development and\npromote democratization and pluralism are the two focal\npoints for the action which the international community\nshould take in order to allow peace and security to\nprogress, which is the fundamental mission of our\nOrganization.\nThis concern falls in line perfectly with the objectives\nof the Government of C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire, which, under the\nleadership of our President, Henri Konan B\u00c3\u00a9di\u00c3\u00a9, is\ncommitted to relaunching strong, sound and lasting\neconomic growth and to forge, in a spirit of solidarity, a\nmore united, homogenous society based on participatory,\npeaceful democracy.\nAt the political level, the cabinet reshuffle that took\nplace on 11 August last resulted in greater openness and in\nnew political blood. At the institutional level, several\nmeasures were adopted aimed at broadening and deepening\nthe regionalization and decentralization process.\nMoreover, constitutional reform is being undertaken in\norder to establish the rule of law, to consolidate State\nstructures and strengthen representative democracy. The\nlatter has given rise to the creation of a Senate, which will\nhelp us to strengthen the democratic debate and give us a\nmore balanced representation of the regions.\nAt the economic level, let me stress that in 1997 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nand for the third consecutive year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the rate of growth of\nour country\u00e2s gross national product was 7 per cent. That\nrate, I would underscore, is higher than the demographic\nrate of growth of 3.8 per cent. Inflation was controlled at\n5 per cent in 1997, whereas the rate of investment was 15\nper cent of the gross national product, 70 per cent of which\nwas private investment.\nIt is noteworthy that the management of the Alliance\nfor Africa\u00e2s Industrialization, which held its first meeting\non 17 and 18 September last in Abidjan, reaffirmed that\nindustrialization is a necessity for the economic progress\nof Africa and is the only means of transforming its\neconomy in order to integrate it positively into the current\ncontext of globalization.\nAfrica will continue to rely for its industrial\ndevelopment on its partners from friendly countries. We\nwish here to welcome the initiative of the Government of\nthe United States on partnership and economic growth in\nAfrica which aims particularly to allow a number of\nAmerican products access to the American market.\nWe wish also to express our gratitude to the\nGovernment of Japan for its continuing commitment to\nthe development of Africa, as evidenced by the upcoming\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD II), set to take place in Tokyo in October.\nWe also wish to congratulate and thank all the\nGovernments of the donor countries that have forgiven\ndebts to the African countries, especially the least\ndeveloped ones.\nOn the social level, I wish to take a moment to\nmention some points relating to health, a vital element in\nsocio-economic development. Action in the field of\nhealth, as the Assembly knows, contributes effectively to\nthe fight against poverty. C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire has therefore\nmade this an absolute priority for several decades. Aware\nthat our world has become a global village, we have\ntirelessly pursued these efforts within our country, while\nputting more and more effort into the promotion of health\nat the international level.\nSeveral important recent events prove this\ncommitment: the participation of President Henri Konan\nB\u00c3\u00a9di\u00c3\u00a9 as the representative of our continent at the fiftieth\nanniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO); the\nadoption by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) last\nJune of two resolutions proposed by C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire, one\nrelating to the African fund to combat AIDS and the other\non the African initiative to fight against malaria; and the\nlaunching of the initiative on anti-retrovirus treatments,\nfor which C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire has been selected as one of the\ncountries participating in the experimental phase. In order\nto better mark our commitment to the success of this\nprogramme, we have decided to allocate the sum of\n$1 million to it.\n36\n\n\nMoreover, C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire organized a regional meeting,\nattended by the Presidents of Benin and Ghana, to promote\npublic awareness of, and the struggle against, Buruli\u00e2s\nulcer, a little-known but degrading and destructive illness.\nThe multiplicity of conflict situations in Africa has\nbecome a real subject of concern for the entire international\ncommunity. Hence the Security Council met on 25\nSeptember 1997 at Foreign Minister level to consider the\nneed for concerted international action to promote peace\nand security in Africa. At the end of that meeting, the\nCouncil asked the Secretary-General to submit to it by\nFebruary 1998 a report containing concrete\nrecommendations regarding the sources of conflict in\nAfrica, way to prevent and address them, and how to lay\nthe foundation for durable peace and economic growth.\nIn response to this Security Council request, the\nSecretary-General prepared an excellent report entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (S/1998/318), which\ngives a straightforward assessment of the political and\neconomic situation in Africa and makes objective\nrecommendations, while indicating the mistakes made by\nAfrican leaders and the shortcomings in international\ncooperation in this area.\nThe report essentially always takes us back to the\nprimary mission of our Organization: the maintenance of\npeace, and the principal instrument for this, which is\ncollective security. The latter remains at the heart of the\nUnited Nations Charter. The original idea, it should be\nremembered, was that in the modern world, any conflict,\nwhether regional or local, could affect the whole of\ninternational society, and that through alliances and\ninterventions it could well spread, with all the devastating\nconsequences imaginable.\nIt is in order to guard against these situations and to\nprovide every means to react to them that the 1945 Charter,\nin Chapter VII, takes account of the regional character of\ncollective security. The regional mechanism is intended to\nprovide continuity and to strengthen the action of the\ninternational community in the maintenance of peace,\nwithout in any way challenging the primary role of the\nSecurity Council, which, duly informed of the initiatives\nundertaken by States bound by regional agreements, is the\nonly body which can authorize the use of force.\nIt is in this spirit, and always taking care to refer first\nto the Security Council, that the system of regional security\nhas always functioned, be it in Africa or in Europe, even\nthough with the involvement of the Atlantic Alliance in\nthe former Yugoslavia the situation was somewhat\ndifferent.\nThe end of the cold war, with a backdrop of change\nin the general international security situation and an\nincreasing will by the great Powers to limit themselves to\ninterventions in the context of the United Nations, has\nundoubtedly contributed to the reactivation of regional\nsecurity. What was at stake, we must agree, was the very\nsurvival of certain regions of the world, prey to violent\nupheavals and mostly abandoned to their own fate.\nRegrettably, this is the picture which we see in an Africa\ntorn apart by conflicts whose scope and gravity the\ninternational community does not always grasp.\nThese are the realities which were in the minds of\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs, Defence, the Interior and\nSecurity of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) when they met recently in\nYamoussoukro, C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire, and then in Banjul,\nGambia, to lay the foundations of a mechanism for the\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts and\nfor the maintenance of peace and security. The resulting\ntext, reached by consensus at the level of experts, will\nsoon be submitted for adoption by the conference of\nheads of State and Government scheduled for the end of\nOctober in Abuja.\nWest Africa has plenty of experience in this\nconnection, since in recent years it has had to mobilize\ntwice in order to settle two bloody conflicts in Liberia,\nfollowed by Sierra Leone, and has thus acquired\nconsiderable resources under the flag of the ECOWAS\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). The success of the\norganization in carrying out such interventions prompted\nit to institutionalize ECOMOG as its armed mechanism,\nwhich is mainly preventive. This is a big step forward for\nECOWAS, originally created as a specialized subregional\norganization with the goal of promoting economic\ncooperation and eventually the integration of its member\nStates.\nThis subregional mechanism will of course become\npart of the general system of the United Nations Charter\nand the regional system of OAU. It will cover all aspects\nof security, including natural disasters. Political\nconsiderations cannot be forgotten, for experience has\nshown that conflicts may well lead to the decay of\ngovernmental institutions, the economy and social and\npolitical institutions.\n37\n\n\nUnder these circumstances, any intervention strategy\nis designed first and foremost to deal with disarmament,\ndemobilization and the reintegration of combatants or\ndisplaced persons, as well as the rehabilitation of\ninfrastructures and above all the reconstruction of society,\nwith democracy as the key word.\nAll in all, member States believed that it was precisely\nbecause it was conceived for development and economic\nintegration that ECOWAS was particularly suited to\nundertake peace-building in the region. The implementation\nof the mechanism will depend above all upon the political\nwill of member States. For its part, C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2Ivoire will be\ninvolved, as it was in the quest for peace in Liberia and\nSierra Leone, and as it is now in the case of mediation to\nbring peace back to Guinea-Bissau.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank and\ncongratulate the Governments of the United States of\nAmerica, France and Great Britain for deciding to\nharmonize their various initiatives to assist our armies in\norder to enhance our peacekeeping capabilities.\nIn this connection, I am happy that we are\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the first\npeacekeeping operation in 1948, and I pay tribute to the\nmemory of all the men and women who have given their\nlives in the service of the United Nations.\nAssuring collective security in the context of credible\ninternational cooperation and guaranteeing fair, sustainable\ndevelopment is an ongoing challenge to the United Nations;\nit must urgently provide appropriate, concrete answers.\nIn this regard, I believe that our action must be\nconducted on three very distinct fronts.\nIn the first place, we must firmly recall, whenever\nnecessary, the fundamental principles proclaimed by the\nSan Francisco Charter concerning relations between States,\nand in particular the independence and territorial integrity\nof Member States of the United Nations. Since the end of\nthe cold war, conflicts between States have almost entirely\ndisappeared, and that fully reflects the legal force of the\nprinciples I have just mentioned.\nLet me stress that in Africa the principle of the\ninviolability of borders is of capital importance, as the\nOAU has emphasized since its establishment. The\nupheavals in the Great Lakes region must be settled in\naccordance with this principle.\nSecondly, it is necessary to discourage and ban from\ninternational society those regimes which violate the most\nelementary principles of democracy.\nFinally, it is vital to enhance international peace by\na clear delineation of the responsibilities of the United\nNations and regional organizations. In this connection, we\nwould like to note and hail the complementarity and\nharmony of efforts made, within the context of the United\nNations, by the Non-Aligned Movement, the OAU and\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC),\nin order to put an end to the new crisis besetting the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Their combined\nforces have secured the return to stability of several West\nAfrican countries.\nHere, I would like to salute in particular the action\nof ECOWAS and its military component, ECOMOG, and\ninvite the international community to provide them with\nevery possible support necessary for the accomplishment\nof their mission. This interaction between the world\nOrganization and regional organizations must be further\nstrengthened in the future.\nIn conclusion, I would like briefly to mention the\nveritable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sea serpent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the process of reforming the\nUnited Nations and the United Nations system and to\nexpress a certain disappointment at the very limited\nresults we have achieved after several years of effort. The\nquestion of restructuring the Security Council seems to be\nat a standstill, even though, in almost ritual fashion, at\none session after another we renew the mandate of the\nWorking Group charged with reaching an agreement\nacceptable to all Member States.\nAs for the excellent reform programme that the\nSecretary-General presented to us last year, it has\ncertainly been very positively received, but we have\npostponed certain decisions that are ours alone to make\nwith regard to certain of his suggestions and\nrecommendations. I hope that the present session of the\nGeneral Assembly will enable us to enrich our thinking\non reform and finally move on to action in this sphere.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased and honoured to convey a cordial\nand respectful greeting from the people and Government of\nthe Republic of Honduras and from the other countries that\nare members of the Central American Integration System,\nof which I am proud to be the current Chairman.\nMr. President, Central America wishes to express its\nsatisfaction at your well-deserved election to preside over\nthis fifty-third regular session of the General Assembly.\nYour outstanding professional and public career is a\nguarantee that this session of the Assembly will yield\nfruitful and significant results.\nOur delegation wishes also to express its gratitude to\nthe representative of the Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nfor the commendable work he did during the last General\nAssembly. We also express our sincerest gratitude to Mr.\nKofi Annan, who, in discharging his mandate as Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, has displayed a spirit of hard\nwork and dedication in a particularly difficult period for the\nUnited Nations.\nThroughout its history, Honduras has fought for the\nsystem of democratic government to take root on its soil. It\nhas fought to take its place in the world community as a\nfully fledged State, to imbue its independent, republican\ncharacter with respect for basic human rights, and to ensure\npublic freedoms for all of its inhabitants. However, many\nof those efforts were frustrated at certain regrettable times\nin our past, a past that was closely interlinked with that of\nthe other States of the Central American region.\nFortunately, in recent decades Honduras has safeguarded\nand strengthened its democracy and its internal institutions,\nin spite of the deplorable and difficult circumstances\nexperienced by the Central American region as the\ninvoluntary theatre of the cold war, which was imposed on\nus from outside, and in spite of the undesirable\nconsequences of armed conflicts.\nThe Governments of Central America are currently\nworking hard to consolidate peace and a spirit of internal\nreconciliation in our societies. Our resolve is strong in this\nprocess, and the progress achieved is truly encouraging and\na just reward for these efforts. We are determined to turn\naway forever from the fratricidal battles that have caused us\nso much suffering and diverted our energy from the\nconstruction of the prosperous, democratic, free and\nhappy region that our peoples yearn for and that their\ndemocratic Governments strive to offer.\nIt must be said that although Honduras was not the\ndirect scene of Central American armed conflicts, it did\nsuffer the grave consequences of the instability,\nuncertainty and violence of the region, which caused\nthousands of Hondurans to emigrate to other countries,\nmainly to the United States. Unfortunately, justice has not\nbeen done to our compatriots, as they have not been given\nthe same opportunities and immigration status enjoyed by\nother Central Americans. We trust that the sacrifice of\nHonduras in the Central American conflicts of the past\nwill be fully understood and that our emigrants will be\ngiven the consideration that they justly deserve.\nFurthermore, the Presidents of Central America, in\nongoing consultations and regular meetings, are giving\nstrong impetus to regional integration in all fields:\neconomic, political, social and cultural. These dynamics\nof integration include the States of Belize, Panama and\nthe Dominican Republic, through broad participation\nmechanisms and the signing of economic treaties and of\nbilateral and multinational exchanges. We are hoping also\nfor a joint venture with the Mexican Republic, and we\nmaintain that the region as a whole must enjoy the same\nbenefits that the three principal North American countries\nhave already agreed upon for themselves.\nThe Government of Honduras commends the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and fully\nsupports his efforts to reform the Organization. There is\nconsensus in Central America on the fact that United\nNations reform, including broader membership of the\nSecurity Council, is a necessity for the international\nsystem. But this expansion must be based upon equitable\ngeographic representation and the consensus of the\nregional groups and the existing subregional mechanisms.\nThe restructuring must also include a procedural review\nin order to ensure greater representation, transparency and\nefficiency.\nThe Government of Honduras supports the initiative\nof the President of the United States to establish a\nworldwide organization to fight against terrorism. We\nstrongly condemn all types of terrorism without exception\nbecause we believe it is a form of human cruelty that no\npolitical, ideological, religious or cultural cause can\njustify at this stage of our civilization.\n6\n\n\nOn the subject of controlling illegal drug trafficking,\nour Government reiterates its support for the special session\nof the General Assembly on the world drug problem.\nBecause of its strategic geographic position, Central\nAmerica is in danger of becoming a production and trade\narea for narcotic drugs and must therefore receive the\ngreatest possible international support to fight this scourge.\nWe are pleased also at the advances achieved by the\nDiplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, held in\nRome, whose goal was to create a legal forum with global\njurisdiction in order to bring to trial and convict individuals\nfor war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nThe Honduran people themselves have suffered from\nthe use of anti-personnel mines, which have taken a high\ntoll in human lives. Consequently, we are prepared to\nsupport the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction. The Government of\nHonduras is proud to announce that today it has deposited\nwith the Secretary-General its instrument of ratification of\nthe landmines Convention.\nThe countries of the Central American Region view\nwith concern and deplore the recent nuclear tests conducted\nin other geographical regions, and we advocate the\nintroduction and full implementation of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an important step towards the\ntotal elimination of these devastating weapons.\nHonduras supports the efforts of the Republic of China\non Taiwan for full membership in the United Nations and\nin the international agencies of the United Nations system.\nWe are convinced that conditions have changed\nsignificantly and that at this time in our history there can be\nno justification for the international isolation to which more\nthan 21 million people are subjected.\nAmong other noteworthy issues is the advancement of\nwomen in society. We welcome this advancement not only\nbecause women have the right to equality, but also because\nwith their help we can envision a fairer and more humane\nworld. We invite States to support the Platform for Action\nin the effective implementation of the Fourth World\nConference on Women.\nLikewise, because children and adolescents are the\nmost vulnerable members of society, we are prepared to\nlend our vigorous support to the convening of a world\nconference of ministers responsible for youth, with a view\nto the implementation of national programmes and of the\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\nand Beyond, and in order to support the institutions and\nprogrammes designed to safeguard our children and\nyoung people as the generational and spiritual reserve of\nour homeland.\nGlobalization is a subject of particular concern that\nmust be tackled in this unique forum \u2014 so vital to\nhumankind \u2014 because it gives rise to challenges of an\nunprecedented magnitude.\nIt is true that humankind has always faced singular\nchallenges throughout the millennium that is now drawing\nto a close. Major worldwide events have occurred that\nhave drastically changed the way of life of millions of\npeople: the Christian revolution, in the spiritual realm; the\nliberal revolutions of France and the United States, in the\npolitical realm; the Industrial Revolution, in the economic\nrealm; and the Russian Revolution, in the social realm.\nEach of these historic events affected in a different way\nhumankind?s self-image and the role of States in\ngoverning society.\nThus, the twentieth century \u2014 which saw great\nachievements, serious errors, titanic efforts, enormous\nupheavals and profuse bloodshed \u2014 is now drawing to a\nclose. We are about to open a new chapter for\nhumankind, one that is replete with uncertainty,\nexpectations, fears and hopes \u2014 the first century of the\napproaching third millennium.\nThe twentieth century will bequeath to future\ngenerations a legacy without parallel or comparison in the\nhistory of human development. This is the century that\ntook us to the very depth of the microcosmos through the\nsplitting of the atom and the deciphering of the genetic\ncode, allowing us to unravel the components of matter\nand discover and use an impressive number of new and\neven-made elements with the help of innovative formulas\nfor nuclear energy, light, heat and sound. It has been a\ncentury of great discoveries in all the sciences \u2014\nmathematics, physics, medicine, chemistry, optics,\ngenetics, psychology and electronics.\nThis is the century of the outer space and man?s\ndaring probes and adventures of man beyond his planet.\nThis is the century of vertiginous speeds that broke the\nsound barrier and of communications and transport that\nhave, indeed, transformed the earth into a global village.\nIt is the century of universal cybernetic information,\nwhich has connected man with his neighbour in the other\n7\n\n\nhemisphere, just as two friends used to talk in their back\nyards, separated only by a garden fence. Today, the\ncomputer performs tasks that would have taken the most\ncultivated and talented man centuries of work, or that he\nwould have never been able to perform. Races and cultures\nhave been mixed, influencing each other in an unceasing\nexchange of creations. There has been a massive spreading\nof ideas, news, customs and new developments such as man\nnever dreamed of accomplishing in the course of his long\nand trying existence on earth. This is the century of\ngeopolitical changes, as sudden as they are unimaginable,\nso huge that their very force left their own protagonists\nbehind.\nUnfortunately, it is also a century that will be\nremembered with sadness, as the century of the two great\nworldwide slaughters and many dreadful, apparently local\nand centralized, wars. It is the century of thermonuclear,\ntoxic and chemical weapons and other means of mass\ndestruction. It is the century of merciless, senseless\nterrorism, and also the century of the terrible AIDS\npandemic. It is the century, finally, of man?s greatest\ndestruction of the ecology and of the purity of his\nenvironment, seriously threatening the very existence of his\nplanet. We are concerned, and we are surely ashamed, that\nthis century will also be remembered as the century of the\ndirest poverty in an alarming majority of countries. We are\ngrieved that when there is prosperity, it is concentrated\namong the richest, but when there is a crisis, on the other\nhand, its devastation is brought down on the poorest.\nBut if there is one issue that characterizes this century\nand for ever marks it in the annals of the human race, it is\nthe desire for, the necessity of and the value of freedom.\nNever have we fought so hard and paid such a high price\nfor freedom, or for the lack thereof, as we have done in this\ncentury. Never have there been so many attempts to destroy\nfreedom through systems, ideologies, regimes and wars, and\nnever has man carried out such monumental exploits, such\nbeautiful and heroic deeds, in the defence or pursuit of\nliberty, as in the last 10 decades of this millennium. The\ngreat figures that left their mark on contemporary history\nare those who denied freedom to their nations or achieved\nit gloriously, sometimes at the cost of their own lives.\nThank God that we can say at this time, and in this\nworld forum, that freedom has triumphed and will continue\nto establish itself in every corner of the world where it is\nstill denied or crushed, whenever conditions show our\npeoples that freedom, an essential human value, is worth\nthe trouble and that to fight for it and to keep it are\nimportant for man?s physical and spiritual well-being.\nAlong with freedom, democracy is triumphing\naround the globe, but for this progress to continue to be\neffective and to last, so that we do not lose what we have\ngained and do not return to the tyrannies we defeated\nwith so much effort and suffering, certain conditions must\nbe fulfilled. This is the huge challenge of the next\nmillennium: how to keep this freedom, how to extend it\nto the farthest corner of the planet and \u2014 the final test \u2014\nhow to manage it for the benefit of all humankind.\nIt is true that, just as there are hopeful and\nencouraging expectations on which we must capitalize,\nthere is also a lot of worry, and even fear, in our nations\nconcerning these swift, radical and dizzying universal\nchanges. The world economy has progressed and\ndeveloped dramatically in the last 25 years. Economic\nglobalization has opened up opportunities and risks for all\nthe countries of the world. However, at this time it is\nquite clear that the benefits of globalization are not shared\nby all countries and that, in many cases, there is an\nincreasing disparity between developed and developing\ncountries, an inequality that produces social and political\ntensions in our countries and severely threatens the\ndemocratic advances for which we have paid so dearly.\nIn the beginning of the process of global\nliberalization, it was maintained that the reduction in the\nflows of assistance for development would be far\noutweighed by the commercial benefits and private capital\nflows to our regions. The truth is that, even though we\nsupport commercial liberalization with concrete measures,\nour products have often been faced with various kinds of\nbarriers that are hard to overcome.\nIn combination, factors such as the reduction in\ndevelopment assistance, barriers to the export of our\nproducts, the scanty movement of private capital or its\nexcessive concentration in certain areas, and the burden\nof foreign debt become formidable obstacles to the\neconomic growth and social development of our peoples.\nI believe the time is ripe to evaluate what is happening at\nthe global level in order to take measures that will\nprevent further deterioration of the living conditions of\nour population and promote a more just economic and\nsocial order.\nThis concern is especially legitimate in the light of\nfinancial developments in recent days in certain countries\nof South-East Asia and Japan. Those economies and\nsystems were held up to us as an example to follow and\nas a standard for what can be achieved with full economic\nliberalization. Russia followed that path that led to the\n8\n\n\ncrisis affecting us today, which we all hope is temporary.\nAll of this means that the economy is not everything, and\nthat a setback in maintaining the welfare level of a people?s\nwell-being because of economic and financial mechanisms\ncan rapidly deteriorate its political and social conditions,\npresenting the imminent danger of moving backwards in the\ndevelopment of democracy and imperilling once again the\nprecious gift of freedom, for which millions of men and\nwomen have given their lives in this century. Creating great\nexpectations and exaggerated hopes of well-being and\ndevelopment is dangerous, as are the disappointments that\ncan be felt by our peoples when the democratic system and\nthe new economic order are incapable of giving concrete\nanswers to the basic needs of our nations. This is the risk\nof backlash, the reversal of conquests and the return to\ninstability, rivalry, mistrust and the loss of internal, and\neven international, peace.\nUnder the pressure of globalization, modernization and\neconomic adjustments, we have surely put at stake millions\nof the planet?s inhabitants? right to better life especially in\nLatin America. At stake is the national identity of countries\nand the identity of regions faced with an increasingly rapid\nprocess of universalization and assimilation, which is not\nalways laudable. At stake is the vulnerability or resistance\nof our societies before the avalanche of influences,\nrequirements and models imposed from the outside, behind\nthe mask of structural adjustments and modernization. At\nstake is stability: we are faced with the massive\ndevelopment of violent, or simply rebellious, acts of the\npoor, the marginalized and the excluded, because they feel\npowerless before the walls that prevent their access to\nsurvival, work, education, health and safety, which are\nessential, basic rights, amply consecrated by the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we\nHondurans have celebrated with the greatest pleasure and\nwith renewed hope that such principles can actually lead us\nto fairer, happier societies.\nWe cannot hide the fear, shared by many of the\nGovernments represented here, that a new economic order\nthat is unfair, oversized and all-encompassing, and that does\nnot take into consideration the political and social realities\nof each country and the processes that led us to these\nvertiginous changes, would destroy any possibility for the\nequitable development of each person and each people, to\nthe extent that globalization generates excessive\nconcentrations of power in large and monstrous\nconsortiums, instead of solidarity in the enjoyment of the\ngoods and opportunities afforded by a new, universal\nsociety.\nWhether we are moving towards an ideal, globalized,\nfraternal and peaceful world of solidarity, or towards\nother forms of tyranny, submission and cruelty \u2014 this is\nthe question we must ask, all of us who have public\nresponsibilities in Honduras and in every corner of the\nplanet. In a world where the borders no longer divide\ncountries, but rather swell to embrace the geographic\ncontours of the planet, in a world in which the scope of\ninternational relations is limited only by human ambition\nand imagination, the question is whether we are heading\nfor the globalization of ethics or an ethics of\nglobalization. This question must be answered if we are\nto avoid the death, in the vortex of capital and market\ngrowth, of humankind?s ethical and moral values, which\nhave been the pillars that prevent the crumbling of what\nwe all call civilization.\nAt issue, in short, is the ability to govern societies,\nbut without losing the freedoms that gave birth to States,\nand without losing the ethical values that have kept them\nalive, sheltered by eternal concepts such as national\nsovereignty, basic human rights, the survival of the planet\nand the self-determination of peoples.\nAfter all, in the hierarchy of the values that define\nour highest aspirations, the supreme goal of society and\nState continues to be the human person, and the supreme\ngood we are trying to achieve is not growth, not\ndevelopment, not globalization, but happiness and well-\nbeing.\nThis is the right time, then, to seek alternatives such\nas the needed reinforcement of multilateral institutions\nwith funds on preferential terms to support development;\nincreased cooperation in order to foster better\nopportunities for those most in need and to reduce\nimbalances and close the distance between the richest and\nthe poorest; the governing of globalization so that it does\nnot demand sacrifices from most nations while\nconcentrating its benefits in a few; and the search for\nadditional, expeditious mechanisms to reduce the foreign\ndebt that is choking most of humankind. The United\nNations must become the appropriate forum to foster\nthese and other initiatives required to guarantee better\nconditions for developing countries, intelligent measures\nto ensure universal peace and harmony.\nHonduras, its people and its Government, declare\ntheir faith in the superior qualities of man and his\ncapacity for hope and faith in a better destiny for all\nhumankind. We are sure that the unity of all the peoples\nof the earth around the essential topics of peace, survival\n9\n\n\nof the planet, a worldwide economic system that is more\nbalanced and really open to all and the construction of\nsocieties that are fairer, freer, and safer will remain the\nraison d?\u00eatre of the United Nations and its most important\ntask. In this effort, the Organization can count on the\nsupport and solidarity of Honduras and other Central\nAmerican States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to congratulate you,\nMr. Opertti, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session and, at the same time, to\nwish you success in the performance of your important\nfunction.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nsuccessfully headed the fifty-second session. I am\nconvinced that, as a distinguished Latin American politician\nof great experience and energy, you will also make an\noutstanding contribution to the successful outcome of this\nsession.\nAllow me also to express our deep appreciation to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership and to\nextend to him our readiness for full cooperation.\nIt is my special pleasure to address this Assembly on\nbehalf of the Republic of Macedonia. My country managed\nto avoid the turmoil of the war on the former Yugoslav\nterritory and to achieve its independence peacefully. We\nalso managed not only to maintain our internal peace and\nstability but also to produce peace and stability in the\ntroubled and volatile region of the Balkans. Under much\nmore difficult conditions than those prevailing in the other\ncountries in transition, we managed not only to finalize the\nreforms of the political and economic systems, but also to\ndemocratize society, to build the institutions of the state\nof law and to put into full function the mechanisms of\nmarket economy. In addition, we managed to emerge\nfrom the deep financial and economic crisis resulting\nfrom the high price we had to pay for these radical\nreforms, and, above all, from the losses we suffered due\nto the war in the region and the sanctions against our\nneighbour, Yugoslavia.\nAccording to the last report of the World Bank, the\nRepublic of Macedonia, among all the countries in\ntransition, today shares first place with Estonia in the\nresults on macroeconomic plans and is in fourth place in\nthe field of structural reforms. Over a number of years,\nmy country has had a stable currency and an annual\ninflation rate of about 5 per cent, and this year has had an\nindustrial production growth rate of over 10 per cent. The\nRepublic of Macedonia, through its policy of equally\ngood relations with all its neighbours, has managed to\nestablish outstanding relations with almost all of them,\nparticularly with the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic\nof Croatia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\nRepublic of Turkey, the Hellenic Republic and the\nRepublic of Albania. It has also managed to become one\nof the most active countries in all of the regional\ninitiatives in South-Eastern Europe.\nHaving committed itself to full integration into the\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures, the Republic of\nMacedonia is investing great efforts to enhance its\nrelations with the European Union and to fully integrate\nitself into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), thus contributing to the establishment of the\nnew Euro-Atlantic security architecture and to the united\nEurope of the twenty-first century.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has achieved all of this\nin a region in which, as is well known, we cannot yet\nspeak of lasting peace and stability, due to the crisis in\nBosnia, the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo,\nthe recent events in Albania and the stalled processes of\ndemocratization in some of the neighbouring countries.\nOther factors are the threats posed by illicit drug-\ntrafficking, money-laundering, the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and small arms,\ntransnational and local terrorism and so forth.\nThese are only some of the issues that burden the\noverall situation in the region I come from, but these are\nalso issues that burden citizens worldwide. We still live\nin a period characterized by uncertainty and\n15\n\n\nunpredictability. Local wars and ethnic conflicts continue.\nThe threat of weapons of mass destruction is increasingly\nalarming. Organized crime, illicit drug-trafficking and\nterrorism trouble the whole world. Financial and economic\ncrises have become more frequent than ever, as have\nenvironmental disasters.\nThese complex issues, together with the issue of\nglobalization, which marks the end of this century and will\nprevail in the coming one, as well as the issue of the\nreform of our Organization, are the main issues of debate\nat this session. That is why my country, the Republic of\nMacedonia, attaches such enormous importance to this\nsession, with the expectation that the decisions to be\nadopted in those respects will improve our mutual\ncooperation and will strengthen the role of the United\nNations in the spirit of its Charter.\nIn the twenty-first century, our Organization will face\na lot of new challenges, which will differ from those we\nhave dealt with during the past decades. The appropriate\nresponse to these challenges requires even further\nglobalization of cooperation, through the United Nations,\nand we therefore should, in due time, do everything\npossible so that it will be prepared to tackle them.\nWe believe that the Secretary-General?s reform\nprogramme is an excellent basis for this. These reforms are\nin the interest of all Member States, and we therefore fully\nendorse them. We believe that they should bring about\nsubstantial improvement in the work of all the bodies\nwithin the United Nations family.\nIn that regard, we are in favour of the eventual\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, derived from and based\nupon real political relations among Member States.\nThe processes of globalization that have engulfed our\nplanet are irreversible. They enhance our possibilities for\nconfronting international threats jointly, but they should\nalso provide benefits for all participating countries. The\nUnited Nations is the only Organization which can define\nthe principles, norms and rules, and which can give\nguarantees that both the obligations and the benefits will be\nshared by all members of the international community.\nOnly in this way can we, all together, avoid the eventual\nnegative effects of these processes of globalization.\nAs a modest contribution in that regard, the Republic\nof Macedonia has submitted a draft resolution for this\nsession on the prevention of marginalization of small and\nweakened economies of developing countries and of\neconomies in transition.\nThe international community is witnessing many\nnew crises and conflicts, which most frequently turn into\nviolence of an unprecedented intensity and fierceness. The\nUnited Nations has all along been engaged in their\nprevention and management. The lessons learned from the\ncrisis of the region I come from have indicated that our\nOrganization, in dealing with them, needs to take the\nfollowing steps: first, concentrate on their root causes;\nsecondly, concentrate on early warning; thirdly, activate\npreventive diplomacy for peaceful settlement of these\ndisputes before violence arises; and fourthly, deploy\npreventive forces in the neighbouring regions or countries\nto prevent their eventual spillover.\nIn 1992, when the war in Bosnia was spreading,\nendangering the regions to the south, as well as my\ncountry, which was not yet a Member of the United\nNations, we requested the deployment of a preventive\nmission along our northern and western borders. The\nSecurity Council took a positive decision, and, as a result,\nthe first preventive United Nations mission, the United\nNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), was\nborn.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express the\ngratitude of my people and my country for this wise\ndecision of the Security Council, to the troop-contributing\ncountries \u2014 the United States of America, Norway,\nSweden, Finland and Denmark \u2014 and to all the other\ncountries that have contributed to the stabilization of the\nsituation along our northern and western borders.\nAs members know, the UNPREDEP mission has all\nalong also acted as a deterrent to possible conflicts in the\nregion. This most successful preventive mission has\nalways enjoyed the support of our citizens, as well as of\nmy Government. We are particularly pleased that such\npositive assessments are contained in all the reports of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan.\nWe are convinced that last year?s crisis in Albania\nand the crisis in Kosovo, which has particularly\nintensified since the beginning of this year, would have\nhad much more negative consequences on peace and\nstability in the region had the UNPREDEP mission not\nstayed in the Republic of Macedonia or had its stay been\nterminated last year, as some had proposed. Therefore, I\nwould like to express our gratitude to all the States\n16\n\n\nmembers of the Security Council that adopted the resolution\nextending its stay.\nI would also like to point to the need for the\nUNPREDEP mission to stay in the Republic of Macedonia\nuntil the situation in neighbouring Albania stabilizes and the\nKosovo crisis is peacefully settled. As an immediate\nneighbour, we are most interested in this and therefore,\nthrough our constructive policy, we are trying to make our\nown contribution to the efforts of the international\ncommunity to resolve the Kosovo crisis.\nEven though we see the solution in the framework of\nthe Republic of Serbia and within the internationally\nrecognized borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nit is well known that conditions have not yet been created\nfor a lasting settlement. Therefore, we believe that the\ninterim solution proposed by the American diplomat\nChristopher Hill and the Contact Group will lead towards\nresolving this crisis. The sooner this temporary solution is\naccepted and implemented, the sooner will conditions be\ncreated for reaching a lasting settlement of the crisis in\nKosovo, as well as for eliminating this threat to the stability\nof the region.\nShould this not happen, as an immediate neighbour we\nare most concerned by possible new waves of refugees,\nwhich could destabilize not only the countries of the region,\nbut also those beyond. For the time being, this crisis has\nnot significantly affected the peace and stability of the\nRepublic of Macedonia, in which there lives a considerable\nAlbanian minority. However, all of our citizens, regardless\nof their national or religious identity, are concerned by a\npossible deepening of the crisis.\nThough some initial steps have lately been made\ntowards settling the Kosovo crisis and broader conditions\nhave been established to that end \u2014 such as, for example,\nthe decision of the Defence Ministers of the Partnership for\nPeace and of States members of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) from South-East Europe, to establish\nthe first multinational brigade for peace support operations;\nor the positive results of such regional initiatives as the\nCentral European Initiative (CEI), the Royaumont Initiative,\nthe Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), the Initiative\nof Cooperation of South-East Europe (SECI), and the\nprocess on security, stability and cooperation in South-\nEastern Europe \u2014 recent events in Kosovo, in which a\nnumber of citizens were massacred, will very negatively\naffect the overall security situation. We condemn all such\nuncivilized acts and underline that this is not the way to\novercome the disputes or to settle them peacefully.\nTherefore, we call for the full mobilization and\nharmonization of the activities of the international\ncommunity, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union and\nNATO, as well as our Organization, the United Nations,\nsince we believe that the possibilities for a peaceful\nsolution have not yet been exhausted. In that regard, my\ncountry has invested great efforts to make a constructive\ncontribution. As is known, at previous sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly, three resolutions for the development\nof good-neighbourly relations in South-East Europe that\nwere proposed by the Republic of Macedonia were\nadopted unanimously.\nAt this session, we have submitted a proposal for the\nadoption of a new draft resolution on the prevention of\nthe violent disintegration of States. I hope that this draft\nresolution will also be adopted by acclamation. By this,\nthe Republic of Macedonia is making a concrete\ncontribution and giving strong support to the efforts of the\nUnited Nations to establish early warning of eventual\nconflicts, achieve political settlements of outstanding\ndisputes, and avoid their short-, medium- and long-term\nconsequences.\nIn the period between the main parts of the fifty-\nsecond and fifty-third sessions of the General Assembly,\nour Organization undertook a great number of activities\nto resolve the current and to prevent the outbreak of new\ncrises. The measures that could greatly contribute to\npreventing such violent conflicts certainly include the\nprosecution of war criminals and the punishment of the\ncriminal acts and atrocities they have committed.\nThe successful completion of the Conference on the\ncreation of the International Criminal Court is of\nhistorical importance. The Republic of Macedonia has\nfully supported the outcome of the Rome Conference, as\nwell as the Statute that was adopted by the majority of\nthe attending countries, including my own. Now, the\nGeneral Assembly should adopt the necessary decisions\nto allow the Court to assume its full functions.\nIn that regard, no less important is the fact, that\nwithin a very short period of time, 40 countries, including\nthe Republic of Macedonia, have ratified the Ottawa\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction. Thus, the Republic of Macedonia has\nfirmly reaffirmed its commitment to the full elimination\nof anti-personnel landmines, just as it has, by investing\nenormous efforts, made a great contribution to preventing\n17\n\n\nthe proliferation of the small arms that abounded in the\nregion following last year?s crisis in Albania.\nHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law have\nproven to be the basic preconditions for the promotion of\npeace, security and the sustainable development of States.\nSince the very first days of its independence, the Republic\nof Macedonia has committed itself to the establishment of\nthese preconditions.\nToday, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, we feel the need\nto particularly emphasize that the adoption of the\ndeclaration on the defenders of human rights will not only\ncreate new responsibilities for all the States Members of\nour Organization, but will also encourage all the activists\nwho work for the protection of human rights throughout the\nworld.\nAs a country whose Constitution abolishes the death\npenalty, we support the draft protocols to the Convention\nfor the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen and the Convention against Torture, as well as a\nbroad scope of projects and programmes in the field of\nhuman rights, the rule of law and so on.\nAllow me to conclude by reaffirming the firm\ncommitment of the Republic of Macedonia to the objectives\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. We are a\nsmall country that struggles for progress and development\nwithin a still troubled and unstable region. Perhaps that is\nwhy we so strongly feel the threats and the challenges that\nare common to the whole world. Thus, each and every\nState Member of the United Nations, regardless of size and\nhuman potential, should make its contribution to decreasing\nthe risks of these threats and should also enjoy the benefits\nof the current processes of globalization. The survival of\neach State, of each people, of the whole planet depends on\nthe common solidarity among all of us and on our common\nresponsibility for future generations that could be united\nonly here, in our common Organization, the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Singapore was delighted\nto see Mr. Didier Opertti unanimously elected as the fifty-\nthird President of the United Nations General Assembly. As\nthis century draws to a close, the world is experiencing\ndramatic changes. We live in an era of great uncertainties.\nAt this crucial juncture, we are delighted that a\ndistinguished man of letters and man of law from a fellow\nsmall State has assumed this distinguished office. We\nwould also like to place on record our gratitude to his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his able\nstewardship of the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly.\nIn the last two decades, the world has changed. The\ngrowth of international institutions, cross-border trade and\ninvestment, the opening up of markets, the advent of\ninstant communication \u2014 all these have altered the face\nof the world. From the Americas to Europe to the Middle\nEast, to Africa and to Asia, no country has been\nuntouched by the forces of globalization. The expansion\nof global economic activity has forced globalization onto\nthe agendas of United Nations Members. At one point or\nanother, we have all asked how our peoples could benefit\nfrom globalization and wondered how our nations could\nbe better plugged into the global economic grid. Keen\ninternational interest at the United Nations about\nglobalization was also evident from the active\nparticipation of many Member States in the high-level\ndialogue on the impact of globalization held last week on\nthe fringes of the General Assembly.\nAt that dialogue, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said\nthat there was no subject more important than\nglobalization. I agree. The long-term benefits deriving\nfrom the free trade of goods and services and from the\nfree flow of capital and information are generally\naccepted.\nIn the last year the desirability of a freer flow of\ncapital has been severely questioned. When the currency\ncrisis erupted in South-East Asia, some expected the crisis\nto blow over quickly. Unfortunately, this was not the\ncase. Economic problems quickly developed into full-\nscale social problems, which in turn became political\nproblems. The crisis has since spread from South-East\nAsia to North-East Asia, Russia and even Latin America.\nEven as we speak, it laps at the shores of America and\nEurope. What started out as a national problem has\nballooned into a regional problem, and it is fast\nthreatening to become a global crisis.\nThe United Nations cannot avoid coming to grips\nwith globalization. Events in East Asia over the last year\nhave caused enthusiasm for this phenomenon to give way\nto uncertainty about its value. The questions foremost in\nour minds are: is globalization good for us? How do we\nprevent ourselves from being hurt by it? We are all\ngroping for answers. The challenge for us is whether we\nare able to draw the right lessons from recent events.\nOn the whole, globalization has done a lot of good.\nThe process has enhanced the free flow of goods and\nservices, capital and information; it has spurred innovation\nand competition and has lifted hundreds of million of\npeople out of poverty. East Asia has enjoyed two decades\nof unprecedented economic growth. Our landscape has\nbeen radically transformed. Financial centres have\n14\n\n\nreplaced sleepy villages. Lifestyles which were a dream for\nour parents are a reality for us. Our cities are increasingly\nplugged into the world information superhighway. Less than\n10 years ago, letters would have taken at least a week to\ncross the globe. Today, with the advent of electronic mail,\nit takes seconds. We can now chat \u201creal-time\u201d on the\nInternet. Initially, the Internet was used mainly in developed\ncountries. Increasingly, it has spread its wings around the\nglobe.\nDialogue and cooperation between countries have\nimproved as the countries found issues of common interest\nand more areas of interdependence. Isolated economies\nhave joined hands to form regional economic groupings and\nto promote regional prosperity. Look how the globalization\nof information has helped the work of the United Nations\nitself. Today, anyone with a computer and modem can gain\nelectronic access to over 360,000 official documents of the\nUnited Nations, dating back to 1947. The complete list of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, including potential\ntraining programmes, is available on-line. More crucially,\nthe Organization\u2019s \u201cRelief Web\u201d provides situation reports\non humanitarian relief efforts in disaster areas around the\nworld, along with instant information on how individuals\nand Governments can contribute to specific humanitarian\noperations. One major force of globalization, the Internet,\nhas tied all of us together, very much like a global family.\nBut, like any man-made phenomenon, globalization\ninevitably creates some problems. Some countries have\nbeen made more vulnerable by the opening up of their\neconomies to the global market. Control has now passed\nlargely into the hands of thousands of money traders who\ncan move billions of dollars across boundaries with a single\nclick of a computer mouse. Effectively, there is now no real\nforce that can stop them.\nAs the former Chairman of Citibank, Mr. Walter\nWriston, noted in a recent article:\n\u201cWhen I started in the banking business, the total\nforeign exchange market in New York was only about\n$50 million. If the Federal Reserve called Citibank or\nChase and instructed them to sell $10 million, an\norder that size could move the markets. Today, that\nmarket is $1 trillion and Central Bank intervention in\nforeign exchange becomes an exercise in futility.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s CNN world, live images are transmitted\nfrom one end of the globe to another as events unfold.\nPerceptions can be changed, emotions stoked and\nconfidence irrecoverably shaken within minutes. This exerts\ngreater pressures on Governments, on businesses and even\non peoples to respond, rationally or otherwise.\nThe way ahead is not to turn our backs on\nglobalization. This is no longer a viable or realistic\noption. To repudiate globalization will hurt our long-term\ngrowth prospects. It is vital to remind ourselves in this\ncrisis that the tremendous economic growth that much of\nthe world has experienced since the Second World War\nhas been the result of the free trade in goods and services\nencouraged since the formation of the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade in 1947. There is an overwhelming\nconsensus among economists that we should continue to\npush ahead on this front, despite the fact that\nprotectionism has once again reared its ugly head. If we\ntry to turn the clock back and walk away from free trade,\nthe impact will not just be domestic nor will it be merely\neconomic.\nDomestic political pressures can find regional and\ninternational outlets. The prosperity resulting from open\nmarkets has provided a foundation for national stability\nand regional and global peace and security. If countries\ncannot get access to the raw materials, goods and services\nthey need through peaceful and open competition, they\nwill resort to other means. Economic rivalries can have\npolitical and military consequences. A return to global\ntensions cannot be ruled out, but we must avoid it. The\ncore interests of the United Nations \u2014 the maintenance\nof peace and security \u2014 may be endangered. The only\nway forward is to find solutions to deal with the\nvulnerabilities created by globalization.\nAt the domestic level, we must promote higher\nstandards of national government by strengthening our\nregulatory and supervisory frameworks, improving\ncorporate governance, increasing transparency and\nlessening government interference in market decisions.\nWe need to put in place sound macroeconomic policies\nand build strong regulatory structures to make our\neconomies more resilient.\nOn the international front, the United Nations can\nplay a leading role in the international effort to help\ncountries reap the benefits of globalization. We should\nencourage the developed world to assume the primary\nresponsibility for bringing the world out of this crisis.\nThere should be greater dialogue and partnership between\nthe developing and developed world to ensure that\nglobalization benefits every country. Globalization should\nbring security and confidence, not greater vulnerability, to\nour people.\n15\n\n\nUnited Nations Members have a common interest in\nrevitalizing and reforming the major multilateral\ninstitutions, including the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization\n(WTO). The United Nations, for its part, has prevented the\nscourge of another world war. The IMF, World Bank and\nWTO have overseen a great burst of economic expansion\nof a size never seen before in the history of man. Together\nwith other key United Nations agencies, they have made\nsignificant contributions to development efforts and to\npoverty alleviation. However, recent developments have\nshown that these institutions have their weaknesses. They\nshould be reformed, but not destroyed.\nSo, we at the United Nations can play a constructive\nrole in this process. As Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan\nsaid at the high-level dialogue recently, the United Nations\nhas\n\u201dA unique and indispensable role to play. Our broad\nmandate, our universal membership and our ability to\ninvolve non-State actors all make the United Nations\nuniquely well equipped to help forge a global response\nto the crisis, which is global not only in the\ngeographical sense, but also in the range of issues that\nit raises.\u201d (A/53/PV.6)\nI am glad that one clear conclusion of the high-level\ndialogue on globalization was, as the Secretary-General\nreiterated in his closing remarks, the need for the United\nNations and Bretton Woods institutions to now work\ntogether as equal members of the same team. In my view,\nwe will also have to work together to deal with the new\nchallenges which were not anticipated when the Bretton\nWoods institutions were set up in 1944.\nWe stand at a critical juncture of international\ndiscourse. As we approach the twenty-first century,\nparadigms that have brought us wealth and peace in the last\nhalf-century are now being questioned. The temptation to\ntake the easiest route \u2014 to close our doors on\nglobalization \u2014 is very great, but the quickest route is not\nnecessarily the right or best route.\nWe can begin by holding full discussions on this issue.\nA good start was made at the recent high-level dialogue.\nMany good ideas have been raised. We should continue this\nprocess in order to come up with a global understanding of\nthe challenges and to formulate a global response. I am\npleased to learn that preparations have already begun for\nthe Millennium Assembly in the year 2000. Many questions\nwill certainly be discussed then, but I dare say that no\nquestion may be more pressing than the challenge of\nglobalization.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Republic of Korea, I sincerely\ncongratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are\nfully confident that the Assembly will reap fruitful results\nunder his distinguished leadership. I would also like to pay\ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y.\nUdovenko, and to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan.\nI would like to discuss today our common future and\nthe various efforts that we will need to consider to ensure\nits betterment. With the new millennium just around the\ncorner, we must contemplate the possibilities for our future\nworld. With confidence and pride, we can look back over\nthe past five decades and note with appreciation the\ntremendous contributions the United Nations has made\ntowards international peace and prosperity. We must also\nnote that today the United Nations is confronted with\nenormous challenges and opportunities. The identification\nof these challenges, both within the United Nations itself\nand in the world with which the United Nations must\nengage, is where our discussion must begin.\nAs a world community, we face trends and challenges\nthat test our wisdom and courage. Before I discuss our\ncommon efforts, I would like to begin by addressing how\nwe are now handling our own concerns in Korea. Last\nFebruary, the Republic of Korea inaugurated the\nGovernment of President Kim Dae-jung. This Government\ncarries special significance for the Korean people because\nit marks the first time an opposition party has acceded to\npower in the 50-year constitutional history of Korea.\nThe Republic of Korea is one of the countries that\ngained independence during the last half-century; it has\nsubsequently developed into a liberal democracy within a\nrelatively short period of time. Poverty-stricken and war-\ntorn only 50 years ago, the Republic of Korea has now\ngrown to be a middle-power State.\nMy country is currently endeavouring to overcome\nenormous economic difficulties and to ensure the parallel\nand harmonious development of democracy and free\nmarket economy. We are well aware that the world is\nwatching to see if and how we can accomplish such a\ndifficult task. On 15 August 1998, on the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Government of the Republic of Korea,\nPresident Kim Dae Jung proclaimed the launching of our\n\u201cSecond Nation Building\u201d to define the nation?s efforts to\novercome the current crisis and to foster Korea?s\ndemocracy and market economy to greater maturity.\nOur immediate concerns, however, are not only\neconomic. The new Government of the Republic of Korea\nformulated the \u201cSunshine Policy\u201d, a policy of constructive\nengagement, as the cornerstone of its stance towards\nNorth Korea. Division, war and confrontation have more\noften than not characterized inter-Korean relations.\nChanging the nature of this relationship requires the\nrestoration and cultivation of mutual trust between the\ntwo parties. To achieve these goals, President Kim\nannounced the following three principles immediately\nafter his inauguration: no tolerance of any military\nprovocation by North Korea; no attempts on our part to\nabsorb the North; and the active promotion of inter-\nKorean reconciliation, exchange and cooperation.\nIn line with these principles, my Government is\nencouraging private sector initiatives to pursue exchanges\nand cooperation with the North at their own discretion,\nwhile maintaining the principle of reciprocity at the\ngovernmental level. The Republic of Korea will remain\ncommitted to actively responding to the appeals of the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations to\nassist North Korea to overcome its food shortages and\neconomic difficulties. We believe that inter-Korean\nconsultations are indispensable for North Korea?s\neconomic recovery. In this regard, we also look forward\nto the role of the United Nations system as a facilitator of\nthis process.\nIn his August speech, President Kim Dae Jung\nfurther proposed the establishment of a permanent inter-\nKorean dialogue arrangement headed by ministerial or\nvice-ministerial officials, in the hope of opening a new\n11\n\n\nera of reconciliation and cooperation between the two\nKoreas. He also made it clear that the Republic of Korea is\nwilling to send an envoy to Pyongyang to discuss this\nproposal. The main thrust of President Kim?s engagement\npolicy is to establish a workable system of peaceful\ncoexistence based on reconciliation and mutual trust.\nThe Democratic People?s Republic of Korea reacted\npassively or even negatively to these proposals. It provoked\nthe Republic of Korea by infiltrating a submarine into\nSouth Korean territorial waters in June, and again in late\nAugust by launching a rocket into the western Pacific\nOcean without any prior warning. My Government deplores\nthese acts of provocation. They pose a serious threat to our\nsecurity. But despite these acts of provocation, my\nGovernment continues to uphold the keynote of its\nengagement policy so that the two Koreas might come to\nenjoy the benefits of peaceful coexistence.\nMy Government hopes that the leadership of the\nDemocratic People?s Republic of Korea will put aside its\ndefiance and respond positively to our calls for dialogue\nand collaboration. We would like to revitalize and\nimplement the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement of 1992\nthrough South-North dialogue. My Government will try to\nease tension and create a peaceful environment on the\nKorean Peninsula through the four-party talks process. I\nwish to reiterate that our immediate objective is, first and\nforemost, peaceful coexistence. We hope that the\nDemocratic People?s Republic of Korea will respond with\nan equal display of sincerity and good faith to our policies\nof accommodation.\nI would now like to share some thoughts with you on\nthe current global economic situation. In the past decade,\nwe have witnessed deepening interdependence among\ncountries in the accelerated, market-driven process of\nglobalization. However, contrary to earlier expectations that\nthe globalization process would stimulate world economic\ngrowth and reduce the gap between developed and\ndeveloping countries, the international community is now\nbaffled by the negative repercussions of rapid globalization.\nAsian countries, which have long been a model of\neconomic development, are now struggling with serious\nfinancial crises. Other countries are also suffering economic\nunrest, and together these may lead to global economic\nturmoil.\nThe international community, amid sudden and\nunexpected economic turbulences, would be well advised to\ndevelop a common strategy to maximize potential economic\nbenefits of market liberalization and globalization. Towards\nthis end, my Government welcomes the United Nations\ninitiative to strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with\nthe Bretton Woods system. The United Nations is\nexpected to play a more active role in addressing diverse\nproblems arising from the globalization process.\nAmong the various factors that triggered our own\ndomestic economic difficulties was a loose application of\nthe rule of accountability in the corporate and financial\nsector. My Government is trying to turn the current\nfinancial crisis into an opportunity to reform and\nrevitalize its economy. We are taking bold and decisive\nsteps towards a comprehensive structural reform based on\ndemocracy and market principles. This structural reform\nis intended to ensure deregulation of economic activities,\ntransparency and accountability in the financial and\ncorporate sector, and mobility in the labour market. When\nthe ongoing structural reform is successfully completed,\nthe Republic of Korea will be a more free and more open\nsociety, contributing to the resurgence of economic\ndynamism in the Asian region. This is the goal of our\nstructural reform.\nIn spite of overall growth in the world economy, the\nleast developed countries continue to be marginalized and\nstill do not receive their fair share of the benefits of that\ngeneral trend. As a community, we should pay more\nattention to the deteriorating situation in these\nmarginalized countries and should strengthen economic\nand development cooperation for their sustainable growth.\nFor this purpose, my Government supports the\ndevelopment of the least developed countries through the\nKorea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and\ncooperates with United Nations regional economic\ncommissions, such as the Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the\nEconomic Commission for Africa (ECA). Even with the\ncurrent financial crisis, the Republic of Korea continues\nto play its due role in development cooperation, with\nKOICA as its focal point.\nWhile contributing to the strengthening of\nmultilateral cooperation, we are also participating in\nregional cooperation efforts aimed at stimulating and\nsustaining steady regional growth and balanced\ndevelopment for the Asia-Pacific region. We are\ncontributing to regional liberalization of trade and\ninvestment through active involvement in the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC). In addition, my\nGovernment is scheduled to host the third summit of the\nAsia-Europe Meeting in the year 2000. We will do our\n12\n\n\nbest to make the summit a milestone in building a\ncomprehensive partnership between Asia and Europe.\nBeyond these immediate concerns for economic\nrevitalization in Korea and the world community in general,\nwe are faced with another long-term challenge, that of\nenvironmental protection. Climate changes, for instance,\ndemand urgent attention and concrete actions by all\ncountries. Last year, we made historic progress in\ncombating global warming by adopting the Kyoto Protocol.\nI am pleased to say that my Government will accede to the\nKyoto Protocol this afternoon.\nI should like to take this opportunity to say a few\nwords about the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). My\nGovernment has hosted IVI as a part of its commitment to\ninternational efforts to prevent childhood diseases,\nespecially those in developing countries. Thirty-two\nGovernments and the World Health Organization (WHO)\nhave signed the Establishment Agreement of IVI, aimed at\ndeveloping and distributing non-commercial vaccines.\nYesterday in New York, the Government of the Republic\nof Korea and IVI signed the Headquarters Agreement. I\nlook forward to more active support and to the substantial\nparticipation of Member States in this worthy project.\nFifty years after the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and despite strenuous efforts\nby the United Nations and human rights defenders, we are\nstill witnessing, to our dismay, serious human rights\nviolations and blatant challenges to United Nations human\nrights mechanisms throughout the world. Notwithstanding\nthese grim realities, I am convinced that history is moving\ntowards universal respect for human rights and dignity. In\nthis context, my Government fully supports the Secretary-\nGeneral?s initiative to mainstream human rights in all of the\nUnited Nations activities and programmes. As an initiative\nto bolster national human rights safeguard mechanisms, my\nGovernment has begun preparations for enacting a\ncomprehensive human rights act and establishing a national\nhuman rights institution.\nMy Government welcomes the adoption of the Statute\nof the International Criminal Court in Rome last July. We\nare confident that the establishment of the Court will be a\nlandmark in strengthening the international legal system.\nWe earnestly hope that the Court will be launched as soon\nas possible.\nIn the rapidly changing international security\nenvironment of the post-cold-war era, the United Nations is\nnow faced with new challenges arising from the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\nmeans of delivery. We deeply regret the recent nuclear\ntests carried out by India and then Pakistan. These tests\nseriously undermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nWe call upon the States concerned to desist from further\nnuclear testing and weaponization, and to accede to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) without delay. We also urge the international\ncommunity to maintain vigilance to prevent the transfer\nof their nuclear weapons-related materials, equipment and\ntechnology to third countries.\nIn this context, we believe that the early entry into\nforce and the securing of the universality of the CTBT\nshould be a high priority of the disarmament agenda. My\nGovernment is proceeding with its domestic procedures\nfor the ratification of the CTBT next year. At the same\ntime, we welcome the decision made at the Conference\non Disarmament in Geneva last month to establish an ad\nhoc committee on the Fissile Material Cut-off\nConvention. We also call upon all nuclear-weapon States\nfaithfully to comply with their obligations to undertake\nnuclear disarmament pursuant to article VI of the NPT.\nWe stress once again that the Democratic People?s\nRepublic of Korea, as a State party to the NPT, should\nfully comply with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) safeguards agreement. It should also\ncarry out its obligations to freeze its nuclear activities and\neventually dismantle the related facilities in accordance\nwith the Geneva Agreed Framework. In particular, it\nshould cooperate closely with the IAEA in preserving\nnecessary information related to its past nuclear activities.\nFurthermore, we urge the Democratic People?s Republic\nof Korea to demonstrate its sincerity in upholding the\nAgreed Framework by guaranteeing full transparency with\nregard to the recently discovered underground facilities\nnear Yongbyon.\nFor its part, my Government will make continued\nefforts, together with the United States, Japan and other\nparties concerned, for smooth progress in the Korean\nPeninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)\nproject, pursuant to the Agreed Framework. As the KEDO\nproject contributes to the peace and security of the region,\nwe look forward to continued political and financial\nsupport from the international community. We also\nbelieve that both Koreas should renew their efforts to\nimplement the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization\nof the Korean Peninsula of 1992.\n13\n\n\nMy Government shares the grave concern of the\ninternational community over the launching of the rocket-\npropelled object by the Democratic People?s Republic of\nKorea on 31 August. The Democratic People?s Republic of\nKorea?s ability to develop delivery means of weapons of\nmass destruction poses a serious threat to peace and\nsecurity on the Korean Peninsula and in North-East Asia.\nThe international community should make concerted efforts\nto induce the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea to\nrefrain from conducting further missile development, testing\nand exporting.\nChemical and biological weapons are another category\nof weapons of mass destruction that requires our serious\nattention. We commend the valuable achievements of the\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over\nthe last year and a half. Regrettably, a number of countries\npresumed to possess chemical weapons, including the\nDemocratic People?s Republic of Korea, have not yet\nacceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We urge\nthose States to do so without delay. My delegation also\nhopes for an early adoption of the Verification Protocol to\nthe Biological Weapons Convention.\nIn recent years, we have seen the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations expand their activities to such\nareas as repatriation of refugees, demilitarization and\ndisbanding of armies, and the policing and monitoring of\nelections. While this trend can be viewed positively, my\ndelegation is deeply concerned about the increasing number\nof victims among civilian volunteers and United Nations\npersonnel. The Republic of Korea, while serving as a\nmember of the Security Council last year, initiated a\nCouncil open debate on protection for humanitarian\nassistance to refugees in conflict situations, which led to the\nadoption of a presidential statement. We hope that the\nSecretary-General?s report on this topic, released this week,\nwill renew the international community?s awareness of this\nissue and lead to concrete follow-up measures.\nMy delegation is deeply disturbed by the recent\nincrease in brutal international terrorist activities. The\nRepublic of Korea will not tolerate any acts of terrorism,\nand urges all Member States to cooperate in devising\neffective international measures to combat terrorism.\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, the\ninternational community is encountering an increasingly\ncomplex set of challenges to peace and security. At this\ncritical juncture, the Security Council needs to reform itself\nto adapt to the drastically changed international\nenvironment.\nThe Republic of Korea fully supports an expanded,\nmore representative and democratic Security Council.\nHowever, no Security Council reform package will be\nfeasible without universal support among Member States.\nIn this regard, we hope that the Council reform package\nwill be worked out on the broadest consensus possible,\nfar exceeding the mandatory endorsement by two thirds\nof the members of the General Assembly. In this context,\nwe note with appreciation the efforts of the Working\nGroup on Security Council reform to seek a realistic and\npractical solution which should enjoy general agreement\namong Member States.\nMy delegation welcomes the reform efforts that\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has made since taking\noffice. The Republic of Korea has consistently supported\nthe Secretary-General?s reform initiatives and will\ncontinue to do so in our common efforts to revitalize the\nOrganization in the years ahead. We hope that the\nMillennium Assembly, to be held in the year 2000, will\nserve as an opportunity to crystallize the visions and\nstrategies needed to meet the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century.\nWe look forward to the twenty-first century with\ngreat expectations. The time ahead of us will undoubtedly\npose daunting challenges. Of this, I am certain. But it also\npromises a bright future if we, together, can successfully\nrise to the occasion. The United Nations is a tool and a\nforum; it is a symbol \u2014 the best that we have \u2014 of our\njoint commitment to making the next century more\nsecure, more humane and more hopeful than the last one.\nThe Republic of Korea, together with other Member\nStates, stands ready to make its due contributions towards\nthese lofty goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "As the Prime Minister of\nIsrael, I represent a State whose creation was envisioned,\nencouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80\nyears ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. That\nextraordinary recognition by the international community\nconfirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt for\ntwo millennia: the bond between the people of Israel and\nthe land of Israel is eternal, and the rebirth of the Jewish\nState in the land of Israel is a historic imperative.\nReligious and non-religious people alike have viewed\nthis rebirth as a modern miracle, the realization of the\nvision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracle\noccurred, we have all been hoping that it would be\naccompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy:\n\u201cnation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither\nshall they learn war any more.\u201d (The Holy Bible,\nIsaiah 2:4)\nIt was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israel\nstretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in our\nDeclaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now, half\na century later, as we view with pride our nation?s\nextraordinary accomplishments and achievements, we are\ndetermined to complete the circle of peace around us. No\npeople have suffered more from war and violence than the\nJewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. I\nknow that that is not a common perception of us. I,\npersonally, am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothing\ncould be further from the truth. I have been on the fields of\nbattle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two small\nchildren at home. I want a future free of war \u2014 a future of\npeace, for them and for Palestinian children like them.\nWe want peace for us and for the Palestinian people,\nwhose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruel\nconsequences of the wars waged against us. We are willing\nto make painful compromises for peace. We hope that the\nPalestinians are ready to make those necessary\ncompromises as well. What is at stake is our life together\nin a very small land, and there is no reason that we should\nnot be able to live together. All of us are, after all, the sons\nand daughters of Abraham.\nAs we search for peace, we naturally encounter\ncrises and stalemates, frustrations and obstacles \u2014 that is\ninevitable in any negotiating process. But only\nnegotiations can solve our problems. An outcome which\nis not the result of negotiations is an invitation to\ncontinued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violence\nand threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h e\noption of violence must therefore be totally discarded and\npermanently disavowed.\nPeace will be achieved only by heeding the call\nmade by two great leaders, the late Egyptian President\nAnwar Sadat and Israel?s former Prime Minister\nMenachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared in\nJerusalem, \u201cNo more war. No more bloodshed\u201d.\nThe Treaty they hammered out at Camp David was\na historic turning point which changed the face of our\nregion. It has benefited both countries and brought hope\nto all of us, as has the peace with Jordan, which is a\nmodel peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein?s\ncontribution to this peace, his devotion to the\nadvancement of our relationship and his efforts to help\nthe peace process with the Palestinians have been\ninvaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and, I am\nsure, on behalf of all the peoples and Governments\nrepresented in the Assembly, I want to send King Hussein\nour most heartfelt wishes for a quick and complete\nrecovery.\nI believe we can achieve a successful peace\nagreement with the Palestinians as well. But for that\npeace to endure, it must be based on two principles. The\nfirst is security. A peace that cannot be defended will not\nlast. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century.\nNone of us can afford to forget this lesson, least of all the\nJewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one Jewish\nState, I must ensure Israel?s ability to defend itself,\nregardless of criticism and misunderstanding by those\nwho do not share this responsibility.\nThe second principle of a durable peace is\nreciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides can\nbe successful. The agreement between Israel and the\nPalestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: the\nPalestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in which\nthey live, and in return they prevent terrorist attacks\nagainst Israel from those territories. Israel has been\nfulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of the\nPalestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of the\nPalestinians in Judean Samaria, known as the West Bank,\nare now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the\n13\n\n\nattributes of self-government: they have their own flag,\ntheir own executive, legislative and judiciary bodies and\ntheir own police force.\nIt can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel is\noccupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives.\nBut we cannot accept a situation in which they will threaten\nour lives, and that is of paramount concern to us as we\napproach further redeployment.\nThe territory we are negotiating about is virtually\nuninhabited by Palestinians \u2014 there are only a few\nthousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land is\nthe canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history\nhave been etched. And it has powerful implications for our\nsecurity. We should remember that at its widest point Israel\nis all of 50 miles wide, and should it cede all of the West\nBank, as some so cavalierly tell us to do, that distance\nwould be reduced to the distance between this building and\nLa Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaders\nwould put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we are\nprepared to undertake careful, controlled and calculated\nrisks for peace. Nevertheless, to part with one square inch\nof this land is agonizing for us, and for me personally.\nEvery stone and every hill and valley that I have walked \u2014\nI know them intimately, as do my people \u2014 resonates with\nour forefathers? footsteps, from the cradle of Jewish\ncivilization through the biblical kings and prophets and the\nsages, scholars and poets of Israel, down to our own time.\nYet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation we\nhave agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some of\nthis hallowed land, provided that the principles of security\nand reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retain\nthe ability to defend itself, and that the Palestinians would\nfulfil their commitments, first and foremost to shun\nviolence and fight terrorism.\nUnder the Oslo and Hebron agreements, which I\nsigned, the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat\nagreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrest\nand prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collect\nand dispose of illegal weapons, imprison and hand over\nwanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to the\nnumbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has not\nbeen done to date. They also agreed to cease the vicious\ndaily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there are\nSesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds to\nbecome suicide warriors. This, I am afraid, is education for\nwar, not for peace. And they agreed that they must\ncomplete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter, which\ncan only be done by the Palestinian National Council. That\nCharter is still on the books and still on the Internet \u2014 if\nrepresentatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls for\nIsrael?s destruction thorough armed struggle, which is a\neuphemism for terrorism. So I say today to our\nPalestinian partners \u201cChoose peace. Fight for peace. You\ncannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism\u201d.\nOf course, terrorism endangers our peace, but it is\nalso a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this,\nas President Clinton made abundantly clear from this very\npodium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorism\nrooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous\nis that the terrorists invoke a distorted, twisted and fanatic\ninterpretation of Islam, which is very distant from\nenlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It is\none of the world?s great religions, and we have\nadmiration and respect for its institutions and its\nteachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religion\nbetrayed, and it not only threatens us but undermines\nArab Governments and societies. It endangers the peace\nof the world.\nFor terrorism to be defeated, terrorists must be\npunished and deterred, and the climate of support they\nenjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the only\nway that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrested\nand that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives.\nThe elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly lead\nto prosperity in our region. We envision a market-based\nregional economy between Israel, Jordan and the\nPalestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting the\nbarriers to trade, eliminating red tape and promoting joint\nbusiness ventures between the parties. Trade between\nIsrael and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in the\nlast two years because our policy is a liberal policy. If\nthings are better for them economically, things are better\nfor us. I should like to give an example relating to the\ntransfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinian\nworkers working in Israel, whose numbers have grown\nenormously in the last two years. Three years ago we\ntransferred about 700 million shekels to the Palestinian\nAuthority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel.\nThis year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That is\nalmost a threefold increase in three years. Representatives\ndo not know that; none of them knows that we have\ndramatically improved the Palestinian economy because\nwe believe that life better for them is life better for us.\nThe absence of violence will enable all of us,\nPalestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians and Israelis, and, I\nmay add, Syrians and Lebanese \u2014 this is not a far-\n14\n\n\nfetched dream; it is certainly one that I have \u2014 to reach a\nstandard of living and quality of life now considered\nunimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we will\nbegin negotiations for the final settlement \u2014 a final\nsettlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority.\nI urged starting these negotiations a year ago, but I\nregret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase is\nlong overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted, no dates\nin the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in them\nwas met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did not\nput an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are not\nabout meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reach\na peace agreement through negotiations.\nAn arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian\nState, in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo, would\nconstitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It\nwould cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly\nurge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Such\nactions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on our\npart, and that development would not be good for the\nPalestinians, not good for Israel, and not good for peace.\nWe must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously\nand tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. No\nother way will do.\nWhat would such a peace look like? I envision its\nsuccess would lie in ensuring the following balance: the\nPalestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives\nand none of the powers to threaten our lives. They will\nhave control of all aspects of their society, such as law,\nreligion and education; industry, commerce and agriculture;\ntourism, health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish.\nWhat they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have a\nright to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not become\nthe base for hostile forces, including foreign forces. We\nhave a right to ensure that it does not become a base and\nhaven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about a\nbase \u2014 in New York city terms \u2014 five blocks away, and\nwithout the East River. We are talking about something that\nis not hypothetical.\nAs I prepared this speech, I was informed of a\nterrorist attack \u2014 another one \u2014 in Jerusalem, in a bus\nstation. Happily, no one was killed today. But can we be\nsure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful, that is not\nviolent \u2014 a peace without terror, which is the only peace\nthat means anything.\nNor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons such\nas anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities and\nairfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Aviv\nairport \u2014 as many have in the past \u2014 their planes could\nbe endangered by the inability of Israel, in a permanent\npeace settlement, to control the importation of these lethal\nweapons. This is the great challenge of the permanent\nstatus negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that will\nstrike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israeli\nsecurity. This peace can be achieved by negotiation, and\nnegotiation alone. There is no other way.\nNegotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanon\nand Syria as well. As representatives know, over six\nmonths ago our Government announced an initiative to\nimplement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In our\ndecision, we said that Israel was prepared to withdraw\nfrom south Lebanon provided that one condition was met:\nthat there would be security arrangements to ensure the\nsafety of the civilian population on both sides of the\nLebanese-Israeli border.\nI can report that I find myself now in the bizarre\nposition of offering to withdraw from an Arab country\nand meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such a\nwithdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful.\nWe have not abandoned this initiative.\nPeace with Syria and Lebanon will complete the\ncircle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But the\nachievement of a lasting peace in our region requires\naddressing the ominous existential dangers which still\nthreaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iran\nand Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventional\nweapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iran\nhas just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile.\nIraq has declared that it will no longer accept\ninternational inspections of its non-conventional\nprogrammes, inspections mandated by Security Council\nresolutions.\nThese developments threaten not only Israel, but all\nthe nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of the\nrogue regimes of the Middle East, weapons of mass\ndestruction may pose a greater threat to the world, and to\nworld peace, than anything we have known in the past. I\nwant to caution members about something else: to let\nsweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inaction\nis to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What is\nrequired instead is concerted international action to\nprevent disaster.\n15\n\n\nThat, after all, is what this body was established to do.\nAnd if it is to live up to its founders? expectations, it will\nhave to be far more adept at distinguishing between\nfanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believe\nthat the United Nations can help foster a climate of peace\nand stability in our region by encouraging the reactivation\nof the multilateral committees conceived at the Madrid\nConference. By addressing such issues as regional\neconomic development, arms control, the resolution of\nrefugee problems, water and the environment, these\ncommittees can produce the important building blocks of\npeace.\nBut ultimately, as in every conflict, the crucial\ndecisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle East\nthemselves. They must decide whether the region will\ncontinue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become a\nfull participant in a peaceful, prosperous global economy.\nCooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leading\nposition in the world of the next millennium. Violence,\nterrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery.\nDeep in our hearts, we know which choice we want\nfor our children. My wife and I hope that when our two\nlittle boys grow up, the only competition they will engage\nin with Palestinian boys, and Egyptian boys, and Jordanian\nand Syrian and Lebanese boys, will be on football fields\nand in debating societies.\nIt is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope.\nIt is the name of our national anthem. It is what has made\nit possible for us, despite unparalleled persecution, despite\nthe most horrific calamities to befall any people or any\nnation, clinging to hope, to contribute as much as we have\nto human progress in the past 4,000 years. And this hope is\nreflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebrate\nthe Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from our\neternal capital Jerusalem, the city of peace, to all our\nneighbours and to all present here today: \u201cMay the year and\nits maledictions end, and a new year and its blessings\nbegin\u201d. Shana tova \u2014 may you have a good year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people\nand the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu, I wish\nto join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Didier\nOpertti on his election to this high and important post.\nHis unanimous election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session shows the esteem in\nwhich the international community holds both him\npersonally and his country, Uruguay. The Republic of\nVanuatu and its delegation are confident he will guide\nthis fifty-third session of the General Assembly to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express my\ndelegation?s sincere appreciation to his predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship\nin facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the\n24\n\n\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to commend our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise leadership and his\ndedication to the reform and restructuring of our\nOrganization. We ask the President to assure him of our\ntotal support.\nThree years ago, we all gathered here to celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization and, in particular,\nto renew our commitment to the fundamental principles that\ncreated it in 1945.\nWe also made a strong commitment to further\nstrengthen our genuine, collaborative efforts to ensure that\nthis Organization continues to promote global peace, justice\nand a healthy environment, as well as to support the\nprocess of sustainable development of its Member nations,\nin particular the small island least developed countries such\nas those in the Pacific region, including the Republic of\nVanuatu.\nThe current international political and economic\nsituation has grown ever more complex and makes\nincreasing demands on our own resources and on the\nsupport available from our development partners.\nWe are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation\nof such international crimes as drug-trafficking, money-\nlaundering, terrorism, organized crime and other similar\nactivities which have the potential to place the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of small island States at great risk.\nThe international community must show its genuine\ncollaboration in combating these criminal phenomena if the\nnew philosophy of globalization is to progress in a positive\nmanner.\nWe do not believe that the world is doing justice to its\npeople and to the fundamental principles of peace and\neconomic prosperity as enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations if we do not observe our joint call for the\ndisarmament of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\nmass destruction. International security cannot be\nguaranteed if we fail to accord priority attention and\nresources to the education and health of humankind and its\nsurvival into the next millennium.\nThe momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization, the lessons we have learned from past\nmistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us in\nour pursuit of a better world where, through this\nOrganization, a renewed sense of mutual trust and genuine\ndialogue can be achieved to ease political tensions and\neconomic crises in all regions and subregions of the planet.\nIn our part of the world, these new developments\nconstitute a real threat to the already vulnerable\nenvironment of our island economies and populations.\nConfronted with these challenges, many countries in the\nPacific region, including the Republic of Vanuatu, do not\nhave much choice, at the end of this century, but to\nembark on difficult programmes of reform both within\ntheir respective Governments and within their societies.\nLast year, my predecessor, The Honourable Serge\nVohor, advised this Assembly that Vanuatu had initiated\na comprehensive reform programme, with the support of\nboth multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and\ncountries. He also made an appeal to this Assembly,\nexplaining that in order for the reform programme to be\nsuccessful and responsive to the needs of the national\npopulation, 80 per cent of whom live from subsistence\nfarming in rural areas, Vanuatu would continue to need\nthe special support accorded to it as a least developed\ncountry.\nThe role of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko and the\nSecretary-General in subsequently facilitating a\nconstructive dialogue and a comprehensive appreciation\nof the economic hardships of Vanuatu must be\ncommended.\nIn this regard, the Government and the people of\nVanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of the\nEconomic and Social Council of the United Nations to\ndefer consideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from least\ndeveloped country status, pending full assessment of the\nusefulness of the vulnerability index and ecological\nfragility as criteria for least developed country\ndesignation. We would like to register our most sincere\nappreciation and recognition to each and every country\nand group of countries for their support.\nOne of the commitments we all made during the\nfiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was to reform our\nOrganization so that it could be effective in addressing\nthe problems and needs of its Member States, both\nindividually and as a group.\nFrom our perspective \u2014 and we have no doubt that\nothers share it \u2014 the United Nations must include in its\nreform agenda a full assessment and recognition of the\ninherent particularities of small island States such as the\nRepublic of Vanuatu, and the impact of the international\neconomic crisis on their economic performance and the\nsustainability of their political stability.\n25\n\n\nThe impact of the Asian economic situation and such\nrecurrent national disasters as tropical cyclones, tidal waves\nand global warming on our island economies has yet to be\nfully appraised. This warrants the urgent and dedicated\nattention of our Organization.\nWith particular regard to the environment, the first\nchapter of the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States\nclearly states that small island States are particularly\nvulnerable to global climate change and rising sea levels.\nWe would therefore like to suggest, in the spirit of\nreform, that the current scope of development-related\nindicators being used by the United Nations to designate the\nstatus of each Member State be thoroughly reviewed in\nclose consultation with the Member States and other\nregional and multilateral organizations, such as the South\nPacific Forum and the Commonwealth.\nThis is an important exercise at a time when we must\nadjust our national administrative structures, policy\ndirectives and legal framework to gradually accommodate\nthe requirements of globalization. It would be unfair and\nunrealistic to expect small island least developed countries\nto satisfy all the administrative, financial and legal\nrequirements of the World Trade Organization, for instance,\nwithin the same time-frame as the developed countries. An\neffective sequencing of the accession process is needed,\ntaking into account the capacity of each country?s political\nand economic system or structure to adjust without\naffecting social cohesion.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu is committed to the principle\nof global trade liberalization. The current reform\nprogramme reflects this. We are asking the international\ncommunity to recognize that we should be allowed to be\nintegrated on a gradual basis, taking into account our\ncapacity to administer the process and to adjust to the new\nenvironment.\nIt is in this same spirit that the Government of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu welcomes the decision of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly to convene the\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries in the year 2001.\nIt is still in this spirit that the Government of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu endorses the Declaration of the eighth\nannual meeting of ministers from least developed countries,\nadopted on 28 September 1998.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu is proud to be associated\nthis year with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of\nthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.\nI am pleased to advise this Assembly that the current\nreform programme of the Republic of Vanuatu has taken\nfull account of the above principles and the Government?s\ncommitment in this regard.\nAn example of this commitment is our wider\nrecognition of the rights and the role of women in our\nsociety through the establishment, within the Prime\nMinister?s portfolio, of a more systematic mechanism of\nconstructive dialogue between the Government on the one\nhand, and the National Council of Women and other non-\ngovernmental organizations on the other hand. The recent\nenactment of a first ever leadership code for Vanuatu is\nanother example in this regard. This will not only ensure\ngood governance, transparency and the rule of law, but\nwill also act as an effective deterrent to corruption and\nabuse of power by national leaders in political circles, in\npublic service and in the religious community, as well as\nin traditional society.\nThe pursuit and promotion of a free and responsible\npress and the protection of individual rights are matters\nwhich are receiving more attention under the reform\nprogramme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu today,\nbut they are challenges which we are confident that we\ncan successfully address over time with the necessary\nsupport of the international community.\nThe right to self-determination must also continue to\noccupy our agenda. The United Nations, as mandated by\nits Charter, must be seen to encourage and support\ndialogue at appropriate political levels in the regions and\ncountries where human sufferings and social disorder\ncontinue as a direct result of conflict of opinions on the\nissue of self-determination. In the Pacific region, we\nwarmly welcomed the signing earlier this year of the\nNoumea Accord between the French Government and the\nmajor political parties in New Caledonia. We believe that\nthis new agreement marks a stronger commitment by all\nparties to work together to support an irreversible trend\nfor the future political status of New Caledonia.\nAs I said earlier, the world and our Organization will\nbe going through very challenging times as we are set to\nturn the page of this century and start a new one. The\ncredibility of the United Nations in the next millennium\nwill be measured in terms of its effectiveness in\n26\n\n\nresponding to the real situations prevailing in its Member\nStates, especially in small island States. It is therefore vital\nthat we all support and supplement the process of reform\nspearheaded by the Secretary-General and aimed at\nstreamlining and strengthening the Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed my\nprivilege, on behalf of the Government and people of Saint\nKitts and Nevis, to have this opportunity once again to\naddress the General Assembly.\nI feel especially pleased to participate this year, which\ncoincides with the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nan instrument that has sought for the last 50 years to\nprotect and advance the political, social and cultural human\nrights of peoples around the world.\nThroughout this half-century, the debate on human\nrights has focused critical attention on cultural, social and\npolitical rights. Regrettably, we have failed to develop an\ninternational agenda which includes economic rights as an\nintegral part of fundamental human rights.\nConceptually, political human rights, now a critical\ncomponent of some foreign policy positions, have been\nfused imperceptibly with democracy, hence politics and\nhuman rights have become synonymous. I too am an\nadvocate of human rights protection, and I believe strongly\nthat if we insist on politics in human rights, the politics\nshould be to enhance human dignity and the human\ncondition by including all rights. The corpus of human\nrights demands innovative approaches whereby an\nindividual?s human rights are not measured only by the\nfreedom to vote but also by the right to self-development in\na holistic sense.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, I am still quite\ndissatisfied with the level of attention the world community\nis paying to the severe economic, environmental and\npotential political problems that threaten small island\ndeveloping States. These problems are not new to this\nforum; they are well established and documented facts.\nOnly last year, I spoke about the vulnerability of small\nisland States and the need to establish practical, viable\nprogrammes to help us in our own development process. I\nlamented also last year the serious and ill-conceived notion\nof graduating small States like Saint Kitts and Nevis into\nartificial categories based on gross national product per\ncapita.\nToday, I stand before the Assembly having\nwitnessed firsthand the effects of hurricane Georges,\nwhich brought all sectors of the economy of Saint Kitts\nand Nevis to a standstill and increased the possibility of\nsuffering. In a matter of a few hours, the growth and\nprogress of the last few years have been literally wiped\nfrom the landscape of our lives. Large sectors of our rural\ncommunities in particular now appear to be reverting to\na state of abject poverty.\nThis is the stark reality \u2014 the reality of small island\ndeveloping States. We have no tolerance for bureaucrats\nor financial houses telling us which levels of development\nare acceptable. Our reality after a hurricane is about\npeople living without the basic necessities that we all take\nfor granted. It is about families displaced, having to watch\ntheir dreams in ruins. It is about women and children\nmade homeless. This is about real life, not just figures\narbitrarily concocted for dubious purposes.\nIt seems that we have become a community that\nrelies heavily on figures. Therefore, let me share some of\nthese figures here. Initial estimates of the damage and\nloss in productivity caused by only one hurricane have\nbeen placed at over $400 million, far exceeding the gross\ndomestic product of Saint Kitts and Nevis. An estimated\n85 per cent of the residential housing stock suffered slight\nto major damage; of that 85 per cent, approximately 25\nper cent was destroyed. The agricultural sector, one of the\nmajor pillars on which the Saint Kitts and Nevis economy\nstands, has been devastated.\nAgricultural output \u2014 sugar and non-sugar alike \u2014\nis expected to be reduced by as much as 50 per cent next\nyear. The health sector and our ability to provide high-\nquality care have been seriously compromised. Not only\ndid the smaller rural hospitals suffer damage to property\nand equipment, but also the Federation?s main hospital,\nthe Joseph N. France General, lost a significant portion of\nits roof, and damage to equipment and stocks is\nconsiderable.\nThe scene of devastation is equally mind-boggling\nand severe in other neighbouring islands, such as Haiti,\nthe Dominican Republic, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and\nSt. Maarten. The suffering in my country is therefore not\nunique. However, the fact that we suffer the same fate\nyear after year and rebuild only to watch our progress\nwashed and blown away so easily speaks to the need to\nlook seriously at the vulnerability of small island States.\n21\n\n\nI make an urgent appeal for the international\ncommunity to come to the aid of our countries and our\npeoples. A draft resolution will shortly be introduced to the\nAssembly on countries of the north-eastern Caribbean\naffected by this year?s storm, and I urge countries to\nsupport this effort by co-sponsoring the draft. Also, I wish\nto express the gratitude of my Government to those\nagencies, persons and Governments which have responded\nso readily in lending assistance.\nI would hasten to add that the task of rebuilding will\nnot finish as soon as the eyes of the camera shift their\nfocus, nor will normalcy in its true sense return in a matter\nof weeks. We need material, technical and financial support\non an ongoing basis as we rebuild our country.\nI feel compelled to reiterate the problems of small\nStates, especially in the light of continuous attempts to\nundermine our economies. My Government does not take\nlightly the complaints brought before the World Trade\nOrganization, which are tantamount to the devastating\nhurricane winds on the small, vulnerable banana-producing\neconomies in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States.\nI also fear that, as such initiatives continue, the sugar\nindustry in my own country will suffer a similar fate. Our\nnegligible exports, in percentage terms, cannot pose any\ncredible threat to any transnational corporation or large\nproducer of bananas and sugar. However, the removal of\nthis fragile access, which we must fight to maintain, could\nwreak untold havoc in social and economic terms on the\nlives of so many poor families in the eastern Caribbean\nregion.\nThe insidious tentacles of injustice have such\ntremendous reach that international institutions such as the\nUnited Nations will be expected to devise ways to arrest its\ncorrosive character by lending considerable support to the\nefforts of small island developing countries.\nI say all this against the backdrop that most decisively,\nthe twentieth century has etched in our consciousness\nevidence of the power of the human mind in its infinite\ncreativity and potential. Now we are able to cure illnesses\nonce thought incurable, and we create technological feats\nthat boggle the mind. I therefore salute the men and women\nwho have made this century great.\nIt becomes critically important, therefore, that as\nnations we utilize these landmark developments and shared\nexperiences as the blueprints for the enormous challenges\nof poverty eradication, illicit drug trafficking, nuclear\nproliferation, warmongering, economic inequity, and\ndisaster prevention and mitigation.\nInasmuch as this century has brought exceptional\ntechnological advances, economic initiative and growth,\nthe new millennium will demand greater moral strength\nand public leadership. It will require its leaders to develop\nsimilar courage and statesmanship against powerful\nchallenges. It will dare us all to harness the moral energy\nto transcend partisan agendas in favour of a common\nglobal imperative.\nIt is impractical to alienate an individual?s human\nrights from the right to development. These are\ninseparable and paramount. My Government regards the\ngrowth of human rights in its entirety as a genuine step\ntowards strengthening democracy itself. In order for\ndemocracy to take root and the democratic process to\ndevelop in its sincerest sense, we must nurture the\ncomplete range of fundamental human rights. Then and\nonly then will the human person flourish.\nWhen we hold ourselves up as standard bearers of\ndemocracy and bastions of human rights protection, it\nbecomes essential to preserve human dignity worldwide.\nIt has been said,\n\u201cwhen the empire of man over nature can no longer\nbe easily extended, then the only way for a people\nto increase its standard of living is by redistributing\nthe sources or fruits of industry from others to\nthemselves\u201d.\nAny real hope for a more peaceful and equitable\ntwenty-first century lies in the evolution of our thinking\non human rights and other issues critical to small island\nStates. One of the most crucial challenges in the coming\ncentury will be to address the quicksand of uneven\neconomic development within the current economic\nsystem. These have direct consequences for the disparities\nin wealth and resource distribution. I raise the issue of\nvulnerability not to crave preferential treatment for our\nregion, but because the international community must be\nmindful of our peculiar circumstances.\nIt is being said that the structure and growth of the\nworld investment climate are being shaped by current\nevents such as the Asian crisis, the European monetary\nunion, along with the creation of the euro, advances in\ntechnology, liberalization of national financial markets\nand their integration into a global market. Where does this\nsituation leave small island developing States like Saint\n22\n\n\nKitts and Nevis, especially when so many critical factors\nmilitate against our development priorities?\nForeign direct investment is considered one of the\nmain vehicles of the liberalization process. Small\ndeveloping economies are being forced to liberalize and\nintegrate into the centre of a global economic system which\nhas always relegated us to the periphery. International\ncapital is steadfastly in search of new markets, yet has\ncontinued to overlook our region. Consequently, the vast\nmajority of the $4 trillion in foreign direct investment spent\nin 1997 bypassed our countries in the Caribbean region. At\nthe centre of international integrated investment flows,\n\u201care large international and transnational corporations\nand their affiliates whose global sales volume was\nestimated to have reached some $7 trillion in 1995\u201d.\nThis poses the question of how our agri-based and\nexport-oriented economies cope with or even attempt to\ncompete against giant transnational institutions in an era in\nwhich international production has now become more\nimportant than exports in terms of the delivery of goods\nand services to foreign markets.\nForeign direct investment, as I have come to\nunderstand it, integrates markets through intra-business\nactivities and the production systems of countries.\nTherefore, our economies cannot participate in this huge\nand rapidly growing production system because we have\nnot been given necessary technical, technological and\nmaterial support to move into the centre of the global\nmarket place through its main vehicle \u2014 that is,\nproduction.\nTo make matters worse, we have not been allowed\nopportunities to gain appropriate access to those critical\nmarkets, whereas foreign businesses based in those\ncountries have the access and capability to dominate and\nflood our markets with their cheap products.\nOne only needs to pay casual attention to the media to\nappreciate the tendency towards national and transnational\nmega-mergers and strategic economic business alliances\nthat are taking place around the world. Our region is fast\ndeveloping a competitive disadvantage.\nEarlier I spoke of injustice. I consider it an injustice\nwhen capital can be mobilized and deployed in such ways\nthat could easily destroy the welfare of entire nations with\nimpunity or stifle competition completely. Globalization has\nbeen touted as a great vehicle of opportunity and promise;\nbut I ask, for whom? Globalization, it is said, offers a\nhuge reservoir of resources for investment growth,\neconomic equity and social advancement. However, in my\nregion we are yet to see these promises. In the Caribbean,\nwe are much more familiar with the risks of globalization.\nIn anticipation of the changes taking place, our\ncountries have made significant reforms. Regrettably,\nhowever, the international community, including\nprominent international financial institutions, has not\nalways rallied in support of our efforts. Each year we\nbuild and we rebuild, but we are susceptible to external\nforces such as hurricanes. Our efforts, however, seem to\ngo unnoticed.\nToday, the wide rift between expectation and\nachievements continues to grow. Saint Kitts and Nevis\nlooks forward to the convening of a special session to\nreview the implementation of the Barbados Programme of\nAction, and the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme\nof Action.\nWe urge the United Nations and the international\nfinancial institutions to take a fresh look at ways to help\nsmall developing countries integrate into this emerging\nsystem. However, the rules of this system will have to be\ninformed by the special situation of vulnerable small\nisland States.\nWe welcome initiatives on resource mobilization, on\nexternal debt relief, on trade and financing for\ndevelopment and on good governance of the international\nmonetary and financial systems. Good governance should\nrefer not only to developing countries; it ought to be\nextended to include better management of the\ninternational economic system. Failure to do so would\nlead only to instability, uncivil societies and an\nungovernable global market place.\nThe socio-economic and political dilemma facing\nsmall island developing States must be addressed now;\notherwise, the human and political cost would be too high\nfor us to bear.\nMany small nations pay our assessed contributions\nregularly to the United Nations system despite our meagre\nresources and the challenges to our national survival. We\ntherefore expect more. We expect tangible benefits from\nour membership. It is incumbent on the United Nations to\nwork with small island States to ensure that they reap the\nrewards of the changing political market economy.\n23\n\n\nIn my address last June to the United Nations special\nsession on drugs, I assured this community of my\nGovernment?s commitment to fighting the illicit drug trade.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis remains resolute\nin its commitment to cooperate in the eradication of the\nnarcotics trade and associated vices.\nThis noble fight against a most nefarious and well-\nfinanced enemy carries a high financial cost. It is important\nto recognize that the role of consumption is just as\nimportant as that of supply. Therefore, we have a shared\nresponsibility and must focus on joint approaches informed\nby cooperation and by mutual respect and understanding.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis remains undaunted and relentless in\nits approach to the interdiction of illicit drugs, as we work\ntogether with all nations in the name of justice, equity and\nadvancing the human condition.\nIn the spirit of advancing the human condition, my\nGovernment urges restraint, patience and dialogue on the\ncritical issues that separate the Chinese people in both\ngeographic and political terms. It is our sincerest hope that\nthe common aspirations and expectations of the Chinese\npeople will be fulfilled in the near future in an environment\nof peace and mutual respect. We believe that the family\nbonds and historical tradition that have made the Chinese\npeople a great nation ought to be preserved. We believe\nthat the time has come for the voice of the millions of\nChinese people in the Republic of China on Taiwan to be\nheard and factored into the international agenda. We believe\nthat adequate, urgent and practical mechanisms must be\ndeveloped to allow them to participate in the work of all\nnations.\nIn a world bedeviled by so many challenges, and in\nneed of collective action and new resources, we alienate\npeople and Governments at our own peril. We have an\nobligation to work with and encourage the Chinese people\non both sides of the Taiwan Strait to support the progress\nmade to date, so that the advancement of the human\ncondition transcends politics. I urge negotiation and the\ndevelopment of confidence-building measures as a way to\nmove towards improving cross-Strait relations.\nWe also call on the Government of Iraq to abide by all\nUnited Nations resolutions and to release all Kuwaiti\nprisoners of war and detainees, as well as those from other\ncountries.\nIn conclusion, as we continue this debate I trust that\nwe will be able to move beyond the constraints of the\ndeveloped/developing country paradigm of us against them.\nTo advance the human condition for all humankind will\nrequire meaningful partnership. Instead of apportioning\nblame, I urge Member States to join with me as we\nrededicate our energies to the search for lasting solutions.\nBy working together, it becomes easier to find ways of\nattaining our national aspirations without trampling on the\nlegitimate dreams of others.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\u201cTo be or not to be.\u201d\nNever before has Shakespeare?s famous dilemma\nbeen so valid. Half the world is shuddering with the\ncollapse of the stock exchanges, from Tokyo to Rio, from\nMoscow to Buenos Aires, from London to Johannesburg,\nand even right here in New York. We, the other half, are\nalso shuddering, not because of stock exchanges and\nsecurities that we do not possess, but because the entire\nburden of the global financial crash falls mercilessly on\nus, and nobody, absolutely nobody, is safe.\nThe long-predicted Armageddon has arrived, and not\njust in a Hollywood movie. The huge global trap that our\nincreasingly distressed planet has become does not issue\nlicences for survival to countries or businesses. It does\nnot provide protection from acid rain or the impacts of El\nNi\u00f1o, nor does it abide by or believe in ideologies and\ncultures. It does not offer life jackets to speculators or\nmega-owners.\nAs in the times of slavery, human beings have\nbecome mere commodities, engrossed in buying and\nselling each other instead of learning how to enjoy and\ndefend their rights, while poisonous luxuries, the enemies\nof liberty, corrupt individuals and societies and deprive\nentire peoples of their national identity.\nThe inevitable globalization that we should have\nreached through fraternity, solidarity and cooperation has\ncome upon us in such neoliberalized form that the liberal\neconomic thinking that gave rise to it cannot even be\nrecognized in this new dogma.\n34\n\n\nThe process of globalization and neoliberal\ninternationalization of the world economy has today\nmultiplied the advantages for developed countries to the\ndetriment of the increasingly underdeveloped economies.\nThis makes them more vulnerable to external factors\nbeyond their control, such as the excruciating burden of\nforeign debt, increasingly unequal rates of exchange, the\nwidening technological gap and the persistent decline in the\nprice of commodities, in the context of a ruthless,\nspeculative and hopelessly inhuman market.\nThe inequitable trade relationship between rich and\npoor, more akin to theft or swindle than trade, is a basic\nelement that explains this. According to International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) data only 0.2 per cent annual growth\nrate has been seen in non-fuel commodities between 1989\nand 1998, while manufactured products grew at a rate of\n0.9 per cent. How could economies whose terms of trade\ndeteriorated, during that same period, at an annual rate of\n0.4 per cent and whose currencies were severely devaluated\nbe expected to grow?\nThe excruciating weight of foreign indebtedness \u2014 a\nphenomenon that has become eternal with the increase of\ninequitable trade \u2014 rose from $1.118 trillion in 1989 to\n$1.875 trillion in 1998, for an annual average increase of 6\nper cent. What counts is money and finance, not\ndevelopment or human well-being.\nNeoliberal globalization and some of its basic\ncomponents, such as the liberalization of trade and free\ncompetition, do not in themselves mean that there will be\nan acceleration of economic growth or development in\nunderdeveloped countries. At the same time, unrestrained\nderegulation and privatization have removed from the\nagenda the required protection for goods, services and\nworkers in the third world.\nUnfair equal treatment is being granted to economies\nthat by their very nature, characteristics and volume are\nunequal. Tariff barriers are being replaced with more subtle\nand politically optional methods of protectionism, while a\nclub of selected owners, transnational corporations and\nGovernments negotiate, behind the backs of the vast\nmajority, a multilateral investment agreement that gives the\ndefinitive seal of approval to subservience and exclusion.\nThere is no need for any special telescope to find the\nfamous black holes that swallow stars in outer space. The\nworst black hole of them all can be found right here on\nEarth, right before our very eyes, where there was first a\ngap and then an abyss, where the wealth of the rich grew\nin step with the poverty of the poor.\nInternational cooperation and official aid for\ndevelopment, funnelled through different organizations of\nthe United Nations system, are tending to decrease,\nconsiderably affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe system?s work in the field of development.\nEven worse, we see attempts to further condition\nsuch aid to political demands that injure national States\nand undermine the sovereignty of countries and peoples.\nFurthermore, such attempts erode the authority of\nGovernments by determining their development policies,\nwhich directly affects democratic governance. They also\nbring about the resurgence of diseases that we thought\nhad been eradicated, generating high mortality rates and\npremature aging of the world population. These are so\nillegitimate that no one should support them.\nWe, the victims, cannot be expected think as our\nvictimizers do. As Comrade Fidel Castro said only a few\nweeks ago at the twelfth Summit of the Non-Aligned\nMovement,\n\u201cit is not possible to acquiesce in a world order\nwhich embodies to the utmost the highest principles\nand purposes of a system that for centuries\ncolonized, enslaved and plundered us all\u201d.\nBecause these nations are so disunited, we have not\nbeen able to elude the ravages of neoliberal globalization,\nwhich is so alien in spirit to the groundbreaking\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and\ncontrary to the very letter of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, which in a few weeks will be 50 years\nold. Against all logic, it is in our meetings, committees\nand other forums that the prerogatives to which we are\nentitled as human beings are being reduced to mere\ncaricatures in an insane race to alter the very foundations\nof international law.\nWe are constantly asked why we so stubbornly call\nfor the genuine democratization of the United Nations and\nfor far-reaching reform of its institutions. What does it\ntake to understand that, when we are on the verge of\nbidding farewell to the second millennium, the world can\nno longer be forced to follow Bretton Woods norms,\npatterns and schemes that are consistent with a world\norder born out of a war and that are now obsolete.\n35\n\n\nThe Dow Jones average sways and plummets just a\nfew blocks away from this building. Uncertainty and\nhopelessness are rampant in the markets. Countries are\ngoing bankrupt \u2014 and so are their Governments. Hundreds\nof millions die of famine, disease, violence, terror and war.\nSome even become living dead, as they are deprived of\ntheir national identity. But we are expected to accept that\nhere in the General Assembly those who unleashed this\nmadness are destroying the only truly democratic space\nwhere we can act together.\nHow much longer are we going to allow them to\ncontinue imposing conditions, unilaterally launching\nmissiles, improving their nuclear arsenals and testing new\n\u201csmart weapons\u201d, while they demand disarmament from the\npoor and the illiterate? And further, they are preventing us\nfrom doing away with the dictatorship of a Security Council\nwhich refuses to expand or to give up or modify the power\nof veto? There can be no talk of a Security Council that\nprovides legitimacy, let alone security, so long as that body\nfails to abide by the powers conferred upon it in Article\nXXIV of the Charter; so long as it ignores the powers of\nother United Nations bodies; so long as its composition\nremains inequitable; so long as each and every member\ndoes not enjoy identical rights; so long as we in the third\nworld, the overwhelming majority of the world?s\npopulation, are not duly represented.\nFor Cuba, the one steadfast and sincere thing to do is\nto alert the world to which we belong, and to struggle for\nthe values of freedom, justice, dignity and humanitarianism\nthat we believe in and uphold. These are the values that\nshould prevail for the sake of our endangered human\nspecies. It is for this end that the resources made available\nto the United Nations by its Member States should be used.\nEnough of politicizing budgets under the pretext of\nalleged cost-effectiveness \u2014 as if the millions of African\nchildren dying of curable diseases, the millions of illiterate\npeople in Latin America, or the millions of people\ndisplaced by conflicts in Asia and the Middle East were\nbolts of cloth, raw materials or spent fuel.\nEnough of the appalling facts cited in the latest\nHuman Development Report, issued two weeks ago, which\naffirms that the barest consumption needs of over a billion\npeople are not being met at all, and that more than 4 billion\npeople lack essential health services and 2 billion suffer\nfrom anaemia, including 55 million in industrialized\ncountries.\nEnough of accepting that the indicators of human\nconsumption in 70 countries have dropped below the\nlevels of 25 years ago.\nEnough of accepting that a child born in a developed\ncountry will consume and pollute in his or her lifetime as\nmuch as 50 children born in an underdeveloped country.\nEnough of accepting that three individuals in this\nworld have amassed fortunes equivalent to the total gross\ndomestic product of 48 States.\nEnough of accepting that the most powerful and\nwealthy nation on Earth, with the highest per capita\nincome, should, according to the report, have the highest\nrates of human poverty.\nEnough of demagogy. Let us make way for ethics,\ngenerosity and humanitarianism. Let the debts be paid and\nthe current scale of assessments maintained. Let us put an\nend to special United Nations peacekeeping operations\nand to the arms market they have generated, and let us\nstrengthen the actions of the World Health Organization,\nthe United Nations Children?s Fund, the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\nand the many other agencies that have truly endeavoured\nthroughout their existence to assert the rights of every\nhuman being. That is the only really fair, responsible and\nhumane thing to do.\nIn other words, let us not allow so many children to\ndie in the next few hours, days, months and years \u2014 such\nas the 108,217 infants under five years of age, who have\ndied of preventable causes in the underdeveloped world\nsince we opened the fifty-third session last Monday,\nwithout the Assembly or the international community of\nnations being able to do anything about it.\nLet us keep the voice and mandate of the peoples\nand Governments that make up the United Nations from\nbeing drowned out by the inhumane interests of the\nmasters and their partners grouped in the \u201cWashington\nconsensus\u201d, which is how chaste, scholarly jargon\ncurrently defines the alliance of countries and\ninternational financial institutions that have dragged us all\ninto disastrous unipolar neoliberalization ruled by a\nunique and criminal way of thinking which hypocritically\nboasts of being pluralistic.\n36\n\n\nLet us prevent heinous and disgusting phenomena such\nas terrorism from being fostered in that way; both the\nterrorism that constantly takes innocent lives \u2014 which\nmany seek to compare with the fight of other peoples that\nhave employed humanitarian and worthy methods in their\nresort to weapons in order to win their rights \u2014 and the\nother much more sophisticated, computerized and\nglobalized terrorism that turns the economy, politics and\nideas into a lethal weapon to secure the interests of a\nrestricted circle of selfish people who believe it is their\nprerogative to unilaterally impose their laws and their\npunishments on others.\nWe recognize that drafting and implementing\ninternational treaties are instrumental in our struggle against\nterrorism. But if we are truly committed to achieving that\ngoal, then the power to investigate, prevent and punish\nthese acts must be assumed seriously by States as an\nobligation which may not be delegated. There must be\ngenuine cooperation to apprehend perpetrators, and States\nmust prevent by all means possible terrorist acts against\nother States being organized, encouraged, funded or\ntolerated within their territory.\nCuba, which has suffered from terrorism and to which\nnothing that is human is alien, cannot but unequivocally\ncondemn such actions, methods and practices. Above all,\nwe denounce those responsible for fomenting, supporting,\nfunding, masterminding, propagating or tolerating these\nloathsome actions, which, as recent events have illustrated,\nturn their perpetrators into heinous Saturns, capable of\ndevouring their own children.\nFor almost 40 years our homeland has had to defend\nitself from aggression and harassment of all kinds: dirty\nwar, mercenary invasions, nuclear threat, veritable hunts\norganized in attempts to murder our main leaders, pirate\nattacks, constant acts of sabotage against our industry, our\nagriculture and our economy, blowing up of airliners in\nflight \u2014 as occurred in Barbados on 6 October 1976; over\na thousand hours a week of subversive radio and television\ntransmissions which illegally invade our radio-electronic\nspace; and biological warfare. Our tourist facilities have\nendured terrorist attacks, employing Central American\nmercenaries, organized and financed from the United States,\nwith the full awareness and tolerance of the authorities of\nthat country. Furthermore, we are also currently facing\nfurther American criminal legislation aimed at intensifying\nthe dirtiest and longest economic war ever perpetrated\nagainst any country. This is why we can speak about these\nissues with absolute morality.\nI must say at least a few words about recent\naccusations by the United States of alleged Cuban\nespionage activities in Florida, which have been widely\ndisseminated by the mass media as something\nextraordinary. I am sure the Assembly understands that\nthe most ridiculous and laughable thing to occur in recent\ndays in this nation of scandals is that the world?s biggest\nspy, the United States, has accused of espionage the\nworld?s most spied upon country, Cuba.\nThe reality we live in is not recognized in the\ncurrent Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nobody\ndenies that this is a document of universal scope, the\noutcome of the most progressive thinking of its time and\nthe international culmination of certain trends and values\nthat emerged from the horrors of the Second World War.\nHowever, it should not be forgotten that when we\nembraced it in 1948 almost two thirds of humanity still\nlived under the colonial and neo-colonial yoke. All those\ncountries had been reduced to mere objects of\ninternational law. For them, the most traumatic experience\nwas not the war but underdevelopment, political exclusion\nand the new and even more catastrophic economic battles\nimposed upon them.\nWhile we uphold the values of our 50-year-old\nDeclaration, values which cannot be renounced, and reject\nattempts to cause confusion over it and give it an\nideological and political nature, we must have the courage\nand awareness to recognize its historical and conceptual\nlimitations, which illustrate that the time has come to\ndraft a new international charter of human rights capable\nof meeting the requirements of the new millennium.\nIf we do not do this now, what will be the use of all\nthe efforts made five years ago at the Vienna World\nConference on Human Rights to adopt a Declaration and\na Programme of Action? What will we tell our peoples?\nIs it not the duty of democratic Governments to be\naccountable to their voters for the discharge of their\ninternational obligations? Will we finally recognize the\nright to development as a fundamental, universal and\ninalienable human right? Will unrelenting reality persuade\nus that the universality, indivisibility and interdependence\nof all human rights requires the acknowledgment of\nnational and regional characteristics and diverse historical,\ncultural and religious heritages, as well as the need to\nstrengthen international cooperation concerning this issue\nobjectively and without selectivity?\n37\n\n\nThe establishment of the Office of the High\nCommissioner and other steps taken in this regard are just\nfig leaves that fail to conceal all the embarrassing parts.\nMany goals have yet to be reached, such as the\ndemand of the Vienna Conference that all States abstain\nfrom adopting unilateral measures contrary to international\nlaw and the Charter of the United Nations which hinder\ntrade relations and impede the full realization of the rights\nset forth in the Universal Declaration and its international\ninstruments, particularly the right of all people to living\nstandards adequate for their health and well-being \u2014\nincluding nourishment, health care, housing and basic social\nservices.\nWhat will we do to those who violate this mandate?\nDo we summon them to an international criminal tribunal?\nUnder what charges: contempt for democratic decisions;\nState terrorism; war Crimes; genocide?\nIt would seem that the disturbing words of the writer\nand humanist John Milton are true:\n\u201cThey who have put out the people?s eyes, reproach\nthem of their blindness.\u201d\nI say this because the United States Government has\nignored all those complaints in the same way as it has\ndrafted lists of presumed violators.\nIn a blatant challenge to the international community,\nthe advocates of open markets and the end of ideologies\nhave taken additional and distinctly extraterritorial actions\naimed at reinforcing their blockade. I ask the interpreters to\nbe accurate: I mean blockade and not embargo. It is an\neconomic, trade and financial blockade against Cuba that\nignores six consecutive calls by the Assembly to put an end\nto what has rightly been fairly described as the grossest,\nmost serious and systematic violation of the human rights\nof a whole people.\nOn the contrary, those concerned insist on continuing\ntheir failed policy, one of whose instruments was\nexemplarily dismantled by the international community at\nthe fifty-fourth session of the Commission on Human\nRights, when it was decided to put an end to the\nextraordinary procedure on the so-called situation of Cuba\nand to get rid of the Special Rapporteur. That was a\nconscious and considered decision, the ultimate assertion of\nthe growing rejection of a politicized resolution that should\nnever have existed in the first place. It was recognition of\nthe truth and a result of the weariness caused by calumny\nand lies. It was also the way out of a discriminatory,\nunwarranted and selective exercise targeted on Cuba that\nconsecrated the imperial will to dictate a kind of\ninternational law where the powerful and wealthy judge\nand we, the poor, are doomed to sit on the defendants?\nbench.\nNevertheless, we have amassed enough evidence to\nindicate that a new vendetta is under way. The failed\nattempts last July in the Economic and Social Council to\nimposed a so-called joint statement on the presumed\nhuman rights situation in Cuba, and subsequent initiatives\nto engage high United Nations authorities or particular\ncountries in the preposterous and unsuccessful task of the\nlate Special Rapporteur, foreshadow new and unwarranted\nconflicts that will again divert the Organization from its\nmain concerns.\nI am referring to documents and guidelines such as\nthese, which I could quote and which will be made\navailable to the press, and which have been forwarded to\nalmost all participants in this room by senior officials of\na Government that, in keeping with its imperial\nphilosophy, seems to think that they are entitled to speak\nbut not required to listen humbly and respectfully. I quote\nfrom the document:\n\u201cMultilateral efforts suffered a serious setback last\nApril when the United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights voted against a resolution on Cuba by\na margin of 19 to 16, with 18 abstentions.\u201d\n\u201cMaintaining international focus on the human rights\nsituation in Cuba is a high priority for Secretary of\nState Albright. She has asked me to speak with you\nour interest in pursuing a joint statement on Cuba at\nECOSOC.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that the most effective approach would be\na joint statement of like-minded countries. The\nstatement could call on the United Nations system to\nkeep the human rights situation in Cuba under\nreview. One mechanism for doing so could be the\nestablishment in Havana of an office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights\u201d.\nThe general thrust is clear.\nWe take full responsibility in asserting that\nreconsidering the issue will only mean opening yet\nanother, even more unacceptable chapter in the political\nmanipulation of human rights mechanisms. This would be\n38\n\n\ndetrimental to the authority of the body or the relevant\noffice, because our country would not accept the\nreimposition of any new procedure or discriminatory\ntreatment.\nEverything we do in Cuba, whether some like it or\nnot, whether agreed or not, is done for the sake of the\nhuman being. We are proud of our reality and, as we have\nsaid before, we do not believe it is perfect. We do not want\nit to be perfect. We do not want to be bored with\nperfection. We do not take it as an endorsement or export\nit as a model, and above all we do not impose it on anyone,\nso no one will attempt to impose their reality on us.\nWe do not use our agreements or disagreements with\nothers, including our differences with the very harsh,\nsilenced reality of our accusers, to humiliate or condemn\nanyone. We prefer to discuss them by means of civilized\ndialogue, which we are at all times prepared to engage in,\nbelieving that what really matters is cooperation and not the\nimposition of a dubious convergence in positions.\nCuba is among the few Members of this Organization\nthat has consistently submitted its reports systematically and\nin good time to the treaty bodies to which it belongs.\nEvidence abounds of the transparency and sincerity of our\nactions and of the strength with which we uphold\nimpartiality and objectivity in the Committees on the\nElimination of Discrimination against Women, the\nCommittee against Torture, the Committee on the Rights of\nthe Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial\nDiscrimination.\nWe have similar credentials in our systematic\ncooperation with the various mechanisms of the\nCommission on Human Rights and with the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner, since its inception. Let me mention\nalso our growing bilateral cooperation in this area with\nvarious States in an atmosphere of respect and on an equal\nfooting, each one of us with our respective virtues and\nflaws.\nFor these reasons, while we denounce these new\nintentions and forewarn the Assembly against unwarranted,\ndiversionist and fruitless exercises, we reiterate Cuba?s\nunrestricted willingness and preparedness for dialogue and\nfor multilateral and bilateral cooperation with all States.\nNo imposed solution can settle a problem. The\ninternational community should never allow a cause as\nnoble and compelling as that of human rights to be held\nhostage to petty political interests.\nCuba is confident that dialogue will prevail over\nconfrontation and recalls, as a token of its goodwill, the\ninvitations it has extended to the thematic rapporteurs on\nviolence against women, on children, on mercenary\npractices and on other matters, so they can become\nacquainted with the realities of a socialism that has never\nneeded to proclaim its intrinsic humanity. Unfortunately,\nhowever, on occasions when it has broadly disseminated\nthe required information with transparency, that\ninformation has at times been manipulated and used to\nserve the interests and objectives of our aggressors.\nSo long as Cuban children suffering from leukemia\nare denied access to Oncaspar and L-Spar to prolong their\nlives; so long as Cuban AIDS patients are denied access\nto AZT; so long as urgently needed purchases of\nrespirators for newborn babies in intensive care units are\nhampered; so long as it is forbidden to sell to Cuba a\nsingle pound of metrotrexate to test important medicines\nagainst cancer; so long as a 33 per cent drop in the\npopulation?s daily consumption of calories and a 39 per\ncent drop in the consumption of proteins is artificially and\nintentionally provoked by a ban on food exports, by\nexcessive freight costs and prices, and by the harassment\nof suppliers; so long as attempts are made to starve us to\ndeath and to kill us with diseases, while speculation and\nmanipulation is under way with feigned official aid\npresented as a humanitarian gesture, which we refuse\nbecause we believe it to be insincere; as long as letters\nsuch as the one I am holding \u2014 I feel compelled to show\nthem, and they will be made available to all \u2014\nunilaterally justify confusing, contradictory and\nthreatening understandings aimed at globalizing\nextraterritorial laws, it would be absolutely outrageous,\nimmoral and even shameful to question Cuba?s just and\nsovereign limits, legitimized by the 1948 Universal\nDeclaration itself, that our Government and people are\nforced to place on those who, wielding human rights in\nthe abstract, defame their homeland, disown their people,\nfoster division and serve the interests of a foreign Power.\nI quote from the letter from Mrs. Albright to Senator\nJesse Helms:\n\u201cThe understanding is an important step\nforward in our ongoing efforts to encourage greater\nrespect for property rights of United States citizens\nabroad.\n\u201cWe expect the full cooperation of the\nEuropeans in carrying out the understanding.\n39\n\n\n\u201cIt is important that we not miss this unique and\nhistoric opportunity to advance the goals of the\nLibertad Act and to establish broad new protections\nfor the property rights of United States citizens in\nCuba and throughout the world.\u201d\nCertainly, this is worthy of note. What Mrs. Albright\ncalls the Libertad Act in her letter is nothing but the\nregrettably notorious Act that has often been repudiated by\nthe international community: the Helms-Burton Act. I am\nclarifying this because I know that for most of the members\nof this Assembly it would be difficult to equate a juridical\ninstrument of this type with a lofty but often misused word\nsuch as \u201cfreedom\u201d.\nA self-respecting nation does not allow its dignity and\nintelligence to be offended. A people that has fought and\nendured such a barbaric onslaught will never be brought to\nits knees. A people that exists today because it has learned\nto overcome its difficulties will never be shattered, let alone\nconvinced of the urgency of any cause besides the revolt of\nthe united.\nWe the poor are so many and our poverty so great that\nif we unite, the unity of our poverty will become our\ngreatest asset. This will be our wealth, and we have more\nthan enough poverty to become immensely rich.\nLet us set aside our differences. Let us carry on our\nshoulders the salvation of humanity. Let us gather those\nwho, resourceful and wealthy though they may be, can still\nfeel in their hearts the urgent call for survival in the global\nera.\nLet the world recognize our sincere vote as poor\npeople, and if there is no other choice, let it hear our veto\nas well. Let us all unite in the struggle. As President Fidel\nCastro has said, Cuba will never tire of calling for this. Let\nus unite and globalize our opposition to every boastful act\nof hegemony.\nLet us globalize respect for our human condition,\nwhich is the first and foremost right to be claimed. Let us\nglobalize the efforts to save from ecological catastrophe a\nplanet that has been ruined by neoliberalism and\nconsumerism.\nLet us globalize ethics, culture and the spirituality of\npeoples in their immense and wonderful diversity, so that\neach of us can drink from his own spring and we can pour\nour clearest waters into the great river of human thought.\nLet us globalize, without excluding anyone, science,\ntechnology, development and cooperation between\nnations. Let the rich share their wealth. Let the poor\ngrow, the illiterate learn to read and write, the sick heal.\nLet the healthy remain healthy and the hungry have food.\nLet us globalize generosity and eradicate plundering,\nselfishness and greed.\nLet us globalize respect for the rights of others as a\nguarantee of peace for all races, ethnicities and religions,\nso that we may bid farewell to arms.\nLet us globalize human freedom as the most sacred\ntrait of our species. Let this be a responsible freedom,\nwith peace and independence, dignity and sovereignty,\nwithout humiliation or conditions, without alterations or\nrenunciations \u2014 a freedom emerging from the rebellion\nof human beings against a world that no longer meets\ntheir needs and that they are determined to change, as set\nout in the preamble and article 28 of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. We do not want these\nfreedoms ever to be politicized; we want them to remain\nentirely human.\nIn a few days it will be 40 years since the dawn of\nCuba's knowledge of that freedom that re-established the\nrights of Cubans and enshrined our humanity, because\nthat freedom was born in our own breasts and nourished\nby the blood, sweat, efforts and sacrifices of so many\ngenerations.\nThat freedom is still alive today, shielded by an all-\nenduring unity. It encourages our rebelliousness in the\nface of a world that deserves to be and can be changed\nfor the sake of all mankind. As the book of Ecclesiastes\ncommands:\n\u201cTo every thing there is a season, and a time to\nevery purpose under the heaven.\u201d (The Holy Bible,\nEcclesiastes 3:1)\nNow is the time and the exact hour that we must act.\n\n\n\n"

His vast experience and skill assure\nus that he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to\na successful end. I assure him of the full support of my\ndelegation as he carries out his important mandate.\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine, for his outstanding leadership during his tenure\nlast session.\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, deserves appreciation for his commendable efforts\nand for the effective leadership he has provided to ensure\nthe realization of the ideals of our Organization by making\nthe United Nations more effective and better able to serve\nits Members.\nThe end of the cold war, even if only briefly, raised\nhopes and expectations and sent tidings of a more peaceful,\nsafer, just and fair world safeguarded from conflict and\ntension, hunger and disease. Such hopes and expectations\nwere to be frustrated rather early as the world was plunged\nin numerous conflicts between and with States, ethnic\nviolence and hatred, terrorism, gross violations of human\nrights, racism and xenophobia, as well as mass starvation\nand an increase in the number of refugees and displaced\npersons.\nThe international community cannot dismiss or,\nmuch less, ignore this situation, which in some cases has\ncaused the commission of serious international crimes, not\nonly because it is generally the innocent and the weak \u2014\nwomen, children and the elderly \u2014 who are the first\nvictims, but also because this situation, which now seems\nto be limited to certain regions, may soon engulf wider\nareas of the world. In the face of these harsh realities, it\nis incumbent on the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to search for fresh, innovative approaches\nwith a view to eliminating the root causes of this\nsituation, in order to ensure respect for the basic\nprinciples of the Charter, to save the innocent from the\nscourge of terrorism and to protect the human and civil\nrights of ethnic minorities. If they fail to do so, it will not\nonly prolong the agony of the victims but will, in fact,\nsooner or later, threaten regional as well as international\npeace and security.\nThe founding fathers of our Organization recognized\neconomic development as one of humanity\u2019s inalienable\nrights, and set as one of the goals of the United Nations\nthe promotion of social progress and better standards of\nlife in larger freedom. I am certain that all developing\ncountries would declare in no uncertain terms that this\ngoal has so far been unattained.\nThe situation in Africa is cause for serious concern.\nIn spite of the great efforts exerted by regional and\nsubregional organizations and agencies, the situation in\nmany parts of the continent is deteriorating and becoming\nmore dangerous by the day. The tragic bloodshed and\nsuffering that Africans have witnessed in the recent past\nin various parts of the continent are too horrible to recite.\nThey must not recur and, where they continue to exist,\nthey must be stopped.\nIn the Great Lakes region, conflicts are developing\nmuch wider ramifications, in spite of their seeming\nregional containment. They pose a grave threat to peace\nand security, as they may soon involve extraregional\nPowers. It is hoped that through ongoing regional\ninitiatives it will be possible to formulate just and\nmutually acceptable solutions. In the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, Africans and the rest of the world have\nbeen forced to witness the disheartening spectacle of an\n22\n\n\nAfrican country which had barely emerged from the cruel\ndestruction of a rapacious dictatorship being once again\nravaged by multifaceted fighting. This has also divided the\nbroad African coalition which had contributed to the\npromotion of peace and security in that country. This sad\nstate of affairs must be quickly reversed on the basis of full\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and a recognition that\nthe internal political process is the sole prerogative of the\nCongolese people, and with awareness of the need for a\nregional framework of cooperation to address the security\nconcerns of the countries of the region.\nSomalia and the Sudan continue to be sources of\nanguish and sorrow for Africa, because there is still a lack\nof progress in the efforts to resolve the crises in both\ncountries. The frustration of the international community at\nthe lack of progress in peacemaking in both countries is\nunderstandable. It must be noted, however, that genuine\nefforts continue to be made by the countries of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and\nthe international community must not despair or give up,\nbut must contribute to the efforts of these countries if they\nare to be successful. In this connection, my delegation\nupholds the view that with regard to the Sudan conflict\nIGAD\u2019s Declaration of Principles and consequent\nresolutions remain the sound basis for a just and lasting\nsolution to the conflict.\nIn my statement last year I declared that Eritrea\u2019s\nforeign policy rested on two basic tenets. The first was the\ndeep conviction that where there is goodwill all disputes\ncan be resolved through peaceful negotiations and methods\nwithout recourse to violence. The second tenet was the\nunswerving devotion of Eritrea to justice and equality. I\nalso declared that these two tenets have influenced our\nsearch for friendship and cooperation with our neighbours,\nas well as with other States. This statement is as valid\ntoday as it was last year.\nThe commitment of the Government of Eritrea to\nthese two tenets has helped to defuse conflict with the\nRepublic of Yemen and to arrive at a mutual understanding\nto resolve the dispute over the Eritrean archipelago of\nHanish-Zukar in the Red Sea by peaceful means through\narbitration.\nToday, too, the Government of Eritrea insists that the\nroad to peace with Ethiopia is by a strict application and\nenforcement of the principles of the Charters of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), as\nwell as the OAU decision on colonial borders. Once again,\nEritrea calls upon the international community,\nparticularly the United Nations and the OAU, to ensure\nrespect for these principles and the decision.\nEritrea was surprised and disturbed by the eruption\nof conflict with Ethiopia because, in spite of\ndisagreements on the issue of boundaries, dating back to\nthe days of armed struggle the Eritrean Government had\nassumed and hoped that in view of the close relations\nbetween the two countries, it was possible to arrive at an\namicable and enduring solution.\nThe responsibility for the escalation of the dispute\nrests solely with the Government of Ethiopia, which has\nfor a long period of time consistently violated the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Eritrea, resulting in\nthe occupation of large tracts of Eritrean territory,\nfollowed by the forced displacement of Eritrean peasants\nand the replacement of Eritrean administrative structures\nby Ethiopian institutions. It reached a climax on 6 May\nonly as a result of the further unprovoked incursions by\nmembers of the Ethiopian armed forces, which attacked\nEritrean troops in the Badme region, in south-western\nEritrea. These incursions were premeditated and\nmeticulously planned. This is the root cause of the\ndispute.\nFor a long time Eritreans had opted for patient and\nquiet diplomacy. They had hoped against hope that the\nperiodic incursions were only the petty acts of some\nmiscreant and ill-advised regional officials. It was only at\na very late stage \u2014 and particularly after the publication\nin 1997 of an official map of the Tigray administrative\nzone incorporating additional indisputably Eritrean\nterritory and after the issuance of the new Ethiopian\ncurrency note depicting the same map \u2014 that they\nrealized the full meaning of the Ethiopian adventure. Yet,\neven in the aftermath of the fighting that was triggered by\nthe unprovoked Ethiopian incursion and attacks on\nEritrean troops, Eritrea never crossed its internationally\nrecognized border; but Ethiopia still controls other\nEritrean territory in south-western Eritrea.\nIn spite of all this evidence of its aggressive deeds,\nthe Ethiopian Government is conducting an absurd\npropaganda campaign to portray Eritrea as a\nwarmongering nation which has committed aggression\nagainst, and occupies, Ethiopian territory. Nothing could\nbe further from the truth. At no time have Eritrean troops\ncrossed Eritrea\u2019s internationally recognized borders as\neverybody can see. On the contrary, it was Ethiopian\ntroops that invaded Eritrea after Prime Minister Meles\n23\n\n\nZenawi\u2019s declaration of war on 13 May 1998. They were\nrepulsed. It is important to note that the Deputy Foreign\nMinister of Ethiopia, Dr. Tekeda Alemu, had articulated\nEthiopia\u2019s expansionist designs by publicly declaring in a\nspeech to members of the Ethiopian community in the\nUnited States that Ethiopia would occupy the Eritrean port\nof Assab within a short time. In the light of the above,\nEthiopia\u2019s claims that it is the victim of aggression and will\nnot negotiate unless Eritrea withdraws from \u201cits territory\u201d\nare obviously false and only meant to hoodwink the\ninternational community and to cover up its own acts of\naggression.\nEven today, Ethiopia is threatening war unless Eritrea\nwithdraws unconditionally from territories which are fully\nwithin its internationally recognized borders. Today\nvirtually the whole of the Ethiopian army has taken\npositions along the Eritrean border, and almost all of the\nhighest leaders of Ethiopia, including the President, the\nPrime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of\nDefence, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the\nPresident of the Tigray region and a Senior Official of the\nTPLF have publicly declared in just the past few days that\nEthiopia has finalized war preparations and will soon teach\nEritreans lessons they will never forget.\nIt is regrettable, therefore, that all the goodwill and\nefforts of the Eritrean Government, consisting of several\nconstructive proposals, to bring about a peaceful and legal\nsettlement of the present border dispute with Ethiopia, on\nthe basis of the OAU resolution on colonial borders, have\nbeen consistently rejected by the Ethiopian Government,\nwhich obdurately pursues a policy which is committed to\nthe settlement of matters by military means. The Ethiopian\nGovernment has also rejected all overtures by third parties\nfor a peaceful solution of the dispute and all calls made by\nthe international community to seek a peaceful solution.\nThis expansionist and aggressive policy is underscored\nby the use or threat of force, as well as a massive and\nmalicious propaganda campaign against Eritrea. The\npropaganda campaign accents ethnic hatred and vituperation\nagainst and slander of the Eritrean people and members of\nthe Eritrean Government. It also calls upon the Eritrean\npeople to rise up against their Government.\nAt the same time, the Ethiopian Government has been\nsystematically and wilfully violating the most sacred and\ncherished provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the two International Covenants and several other\ninternational human rights instruments, as well as the\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations and OAU\nCharters, by deporting or expelling more than 20,000\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin under\nextremely unhealthy conditions or dumping them in very\ndangerous places, and by deliberately separating family\nmembers, exposing them to inhuman, cruel and degrading\ntreatment and confiscating their property. These acts have\nbeen well documented by third parties, including members\nof United Nations agencies, heads of mission of member\nStates of the European Union and several non-\ngovernmental organizations.\nYet the Ethiopian Government, in an amazingly\nrefined application of the Orwellian principle, accuses the\nEritrean Government of precisely the outrages and\natrocities it itself has been committing against Eritreans\nand Ethiopians of Eritrean origin. The truth is that the\nEritrean Government has not detained, expelled, deported\nor otherwise violated the rights \u2014 human or otherwise \u2014\nof Ethiopians living in Eritrea. This has been verified by\nlegitimate third parties like representatives of the\nEuropean Union, United Nations agencies and the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). As\nusual, the Ethiopian Government has called all of them\nliars. We have hitherto extended an invitation to all\ninterested parties to carry out an on-the-spot verification\nof the human rights conditions in both Eritrea and\nEthiopia. We now extend this invitation to members of\nthe Assembly. We also would like them to receive a\nsimilar invitation from the Ethiopian Government.\nThis dispute is about borders, pure and simple. Any\neffort to transmute it into anything else must be viewed\nas only a vain and brazen attempt by the Ethiopian\nGovernment to camouflage its aggression and its\nexpansionist policies. In this connection, it must be made\nclear that it was the Ethiopian Government which wilfully\nviolated Eritrea\u2019s colonial boundaries and forcefully\noccupied those areas that it had incorporated into its new\nmap of Tigray. It was the Ethiopian Government which\nsubverted all Eritrean efforts to defuse the crisis and to\nfind a peaceful bilateral solution through their Joint\nBorder Commission by unleashing unprovoked military\nattacks on Eritrea from 6 to 12 May. It was the Ethiopian\nGovernment which declared war on Eritrea by a\nresolution of its Parliament on 13 May. It was the\nGovernment of Ethiopia which invaded Eritrea along\nseveral points on their common border. It was the\nGovernment of Ethiopia which launched an air strike on\nAsmara, the Eritrean capital, on 5 June 1998. It was the\nEthiopian Government which imposed an air and sea\nblockade by threatening indiscriminate air bombing of\nEritrea.\n24\n\n\nYet Ethiopia has falsely portrayed Eritrea as an\naggressor country by claiming that Eritrean forces invaded\nEthiopian territory on 12 May. However, it is not claims\nand counter-claims that matter. There is incontrovertible\nmaterial evidence which establishes that Ethiopia has\ndeliberately used force and carried out military incursions\nin Eritrea since July 1997 with a view to covertly changing\nthe reality on the ground. In this connection, I wish to bring\nto the Assembly\u2019s attention that the Eritrean Government\nhas repeatedly called for an independent investigation of the\nincidents that triggered the conflict.\nThis border dispute should not have existed in the first\nplace, considering that boundaries between the two States\nare some of the most clearly defined in Africa and were\nmade by explicit and detailed provisions of international\ntreaties. They were then confirmed by the United Nations\nwhen it created the ill-fated Eritrean-Ethiopian federation,\nand again clearly defined in the Constitution that the United\nNations gave to Eritrea.\nTrue, the borders may not have been demarcated; but\nthey are not the only undemarcated borders in Africa, and\nthe non-demarcation of boundaries has not prevented most\nAfrican \u2014 and indeed other \u2014 States from living in peace\nwith their neighbours and from solving their problems\npeacefully.\nEritrea is committed to a peaceful and legal solution\nof this dispute on the basis of the principles of sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of States which are enshrined in the\ncharters of both the United Nations and the OAU as well as\nthe decisions and declarations of the OAU and the Non-\nAligned Movement. Since before the onset of the crisis,\nEritrea has been attempting to initiate numerous bilateral\ndiscussions with Ethiopia with a view to addressing all\noutstanding issues related to their common borders. In this\nconnection, the following must be mentioned.\nFirst, the Eritrean Cabinet and National Assembly\nissued orders, on 14 and 20 May 1998 and again on 18\nJune 1998, respectively, for the temporary demilitarization\nof the areas of dispute.\nSecondly, the Eritrean President sent two letters to the\nPrime Minister of Ethiopia requesting him to join him in\ndefusing the dispute and settling the border issue peacefully\nand legally on a bilateral basis.\nThirdly, the Eritrean Government presented to the\nOAU Committee of Ambassadors a proposal containing the\nprinciples of respect of colonial boundaries and non-\nviolation of these borders; respect of the charters of the\nOAU and the United Nations; commitment not to use\nforce to impose a solution; commitment to peaceful and\nlegal means to solve the dispute; readiness to stop all\nhostilities; and readiness to enter into direct talks without\npreconditions.\nUnfortunately, all our efforts failed because of\nnegative responses from Ethiopia. On the other hand,\nEthiopia has yet to offer a single plan or peace proposal.\nIt has only threatened war unless Eritrea withdraws from\nterritories which are within the internationally recognized\nborders of Eritrea. In this connection, it must be\nmentioned that the Eritrean Government has time and\nagain requested the Ethiopian Government to publicly\nannounce to the peoples of Eritrea, Ethiopia and the\ninternational community the territories that it claims and\nto designate them on a political map with clear\ngeographical coordinates.\nIt is for these reasons that the Government of Eritrea\nyet again offers the following as a basis for the solution\nof the dispute.\nFirst, the comprehensive solution of the problem\nthrough a technical demarcation on the basis of the\nestablished colonial treaties that clearly define the\nboundary between the two countries.\nSecondly, a possible resort to arbitration on the basis\nof the sanctity of colonial borders in the event that this is\ndemanded by the other party.\nPending a lasting, legal solution, an immediate\ncessation of all hostilities and a ceasefire to be monitored\nby an observer force under the auspices of the United\nNations.\nIt is a matter of satisfaction to the people and\nGovernment of Eritrea that numerous governmental\ninstitutions, international and regional organizations and\nnon-governmental organizations, including the House of\nRepresentatives of the United States Congress, the\nEuropean Union and the Non-Aligned Movement, have,\nin welcoming the Eritrean initiative, called upon both\nEritrea and Ethiopia to avoid the use of force at all costs\nand to resolve their disputes peacefully.\nI wish to declare here and now, in loud and clear\nterms, that the Government of Eritrea welcomes, and is\nready to undertake to implement, a decision by the\nAssembly which provides without any preconditions for\nthe cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire agreement and a\n25\n\n\npeaceful resolution of the dispute by any method as the\nonly acceptable solution.\nIn Africa, conflicts such as the present Eritrean-\nEthiopian border dispute have taken place several times in\nthe past. Each one of these conflicts was addressed on the\nbasis of the hallowed principles and decisions of the OAU,\nincluding in particular respect for colonial borders, the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the non-\nuse of force or threat of force.\nAs the OAU prepares itself to enter the twenty-first\ncentury, it is imperative that its member States rededicate\nthemselves to the sublime principles and resolutions that\nhave hitherto served our continent. These principles and\ndecisions, which have successfully fostered peace and\nstability, solved conflicts and defused tension in our\ncontinent in the past, will be as valid in the future as they\nhave been since they were first articulated. Only through\ntheir proper application will it be possible to defuse\ntension and eliminate conflict.\nEritrea reiterates its commitment to peace, harmony\nand the rule of law in international relations, however\npainful this tragedy may be. Eritrea seeks peace for itself\nand for all of its neighbours. Eritrea will continue to seek\ngood relations with all its neighbours.\nEritrea is in a race against the clock of development\nand cannot afford to lose the time, energy and resources\nwhich must be used in the war against underdevelopment.\nTo date, Eritrea has restrained itself against extreme\nprovocation, and it will continue to do so unless it is\nforced to defend itself. If aggression is committed against\ntheir country, however, Eritreans will have no choice but\nto defend their hard-won independence and sovereignty as\nwell as every inch of their territory with whatever is at\ntheir disposal."

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to\ncongratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. His election to that\nhigh office demonstrates not only the support that\nUruguay enjoys in the international arena, but also the\nconfidence and trust that the members of the Assembly\nhave in his ability to guide the work of this session to a\nsuccessful conclusion. Allow me also to record my\ndelegation\u2019s profound gratitude and appreciation to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, for the\nexemplary manner in which he steered the work of the\nGeneral Assembly throughout the past year.\nI would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf\nof my delegation, to express our sincere thanks and\nadmiration to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring work and dedication in\npromoting the cause of this Organization. The Secretary-\nGeneral deserves every assistance and cooperation from\nall the States Members of the Organization in his\nendeavours to fulfil the enormous responsibilities that we\nhave placed upon his shoulders in achieving the goals of\nthe United Nations in a world full of political unrest,\nethnic conflicts and natural disasters.\nFrom the forest fires in South-East Asia, Europe and\nNorth America to the horrendous floods and droughts in\nAsia, Africa and the Americas, we have been witnessing\na drastic increase in the number of natural disasters\noccurring in various regions of the world with immense\nloss to human life and property. The excessive effects of\nthe environmental phenomena known as El Ni\u00f1o and La\nNi\u00f1a are sweeping across four continents with deadly\nconsequences. Record-breaking temperatures around the\nglobe have spared no country. My country also\nexperienced record high temperatures early this year,\nbleaching and killing coral reefs and causing enormous\n6\n\n\nimbalance in the ever so fragile ecosystem that surrounds\nour tiny islands.\nThe Maldives may be situated outside the cyclone belt;\nwe may have no rivers to flood, volcanoes to erupt or large\nforests to burn. But my country is as vulnerable to natural\ndisasters as any other. Indeed, for the past decade we have\nlived with the fear of being slowly engulfed by the rising\nwaters of the mighty Indian Ocean that surrounds us. Our\nfears have become more alarming since we have seen the\ndeath and destruction caused by the tsunami in Papua New\nGuinea and the devastating floods in Bangladesh. We have\nbeen forced to wonder what would happen if such a\ndisaster struck our tiny, low-lying country.\nWhen my President addressed this Assembly on the\nimpending dangers of global warming and sea level rise\nover a decade ago, the extent of the threat posed by climate\nchange was not yet widely known or accepted. Today we\nnote that the realities of global warming are being\nacknowledged by scientists and politicians all over the\nworld. However, mere acknowledgement of the danger is\nnot enough. As we have stated repeatedly over the years, if\nwe are to arrest and reverse this lurking threat, we need the\nunwavering commitment and cooperation of the entire\ninternational community. It is important that we fully and\nurgently implement the commitments that we ourselves\nhave undertaken at various international conferences. In this\nregard, I urge the international community, and especially\nthe industrialized countries, to honour their commitments\nwithout any further delay. My delegation believes that full\nand unconditional implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States is essential for the\ncontinued development of those countries. My country, for\nits part, has done and will continue to do everything that is\nrequired of it to contribute to this goal, and we hope that\nthe other Members of this Organization will fulfil their\ncommitments.\nAlthough we were happy with some of the agreements\nreached at the Kyoto Conference of the Parties to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nlast year, I regret to say that we were not fully satisfied\nwith the achievements there. We accepted the Kyoto\nProtocol because we felt that it contained some important\nelements that deserved recognition and implementation, and\nbecause it is the best negotiated agreement available at\npresent. In order to demonstrate our firm commitment to\nthe climate change negotiations, we went one step further\nand signed the Kyoto Protocol as the first signatory State.\nWe call upon all States to become parties to the Protocol\nand implement the targets specified in it.\nIn our small island States, the environment and the\neconomy are intertwined very closely. Tourism and\nfishing are the two dominant economic sectors in the\nMaldives, and in a number of other small island States as\nwell. For the Maldives, the tourism sector has been the\nmain source of foreign exchange earnings and has\naccounted for more than 40 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct. Effects of global warming such as sea level rise,\nbeach erosion, coral bleaching, increasing stress on\ncoastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater aquifers and\ndamage to infrastructure from tropical storms are,\nhowever, threatening to jeopardize the viability and the\nlong-term sustainability of our tourist industry. Given the\nlimited availability of resources, many small island\ndeveloping States, including the Maldives, are not in a\nposition to carry the burden of the high cost of\nenvironmental protection on their own. Therefore, we are\nfully convinced that without adequate, new and additional\nfinancial resources, transfer of environmentally sound\ntechnology on concessional and preferential terms, and\nprovision for human resources development, even the\nmere survival of our countries will be impossible.\nThe vulnerability to external factors of the\neconomies of small island developing States, especially\nthe least developed countries among them, is a well-\nknown fact. Globalization, coupled with the ecological\nfragility of small island developing States, has\nmarginalized those countries from the present multilateral\ntrading system. Exports from least developed countries\nhave grown far more slowly than world trade over the\npast two decades, resulting in a continued decline in their\nshare of world trade. Market access for least developed\ncountries is becoming narrower. Poverty still remains a\nstumbling-block in their quest for achieving sustainable\nsocial and economic development. Therefore, we would\nlike to take this opportunity to call upon the major players\nin the world economy and upon our development partners\nto pay special attention to assisting small island States\nand other least developed countries in their efforts to\nbecome integrated into the world economy.\nWhen gross domestic product is used as an indicator\nto determine the developmental status of a country, the\nsmall island developing States may appear to be more\nprosperous than they really are. We believe that the\ncriteria now used by the Committee for Development\nPolicy in identifying least developed countries do not take\n7\n\n\ninto consideration the special circumstances of the small\nisland developing States and their vulnerability.\nThe Committee has already recommended the\ngraduation of four small island developing States from the\nlist of least developed countries. The Maldives is,\nunfortunately, one of them. The irony of this is that the\neconomies of these countries are heavily dependent on one\nor two industries, which may be extremely vulnerable to\nglobal economic and environmental changes and other\nexternal factors. Moreover, while the Committee itself has\nidentified the obstacles to integration into the global\neconomy and has called for continued official development\nassistance for least developed countries for at least another\n10 years, some of the countries most in need of such\nassistance have been earmarked for graduation by the year\n2000. My delegation feels that it would be grossly unfair to\ngraduate countries from least developed country status\nunless they are able to sustain the momentum of growth\nthat they have been able to achieve. Furthermore, the\ncriteria which were adopted in 1991 need to be reviewed in\nthe context of the increased pace of globalization during the\n1990s. Until such time as a vulnerability index is\ndeveloped, it would be very imprudent to graduate any\nsmall island States.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, a major milestone\nin the promotion and protection of human rights, providing\nan essential basis for democracy, freedom and justice.\nHuman rights apply without regard to race, gender, creed,\nage, colour or economic status. But everywhere we look \u2014\nnorth, south, east or west \u2014 the reality often falls short of\nthe ideal. Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to\npromote and protect human rights the world over.\nThe Maldives remains firmly committed to the cause\nof promotion and protection of human rights. I am happy\nto report that this year a new Constitution has come into\nforce in the Maldives, providing stronger safeguards for\ncivil liberties and the fundamental rights of the people, and\nstrengthening the foundations and processes of our\ndemocracy. We have also been able to achieve remarkable\nprogress in the realization of social, economic and cultural\nrights of the people through continued economic\ndevelopment and social progress. We believe that\ndemocracy, development and peace are essential for the\nrealization of human rights.\nThe question of reform of the Organization has been\non the agenda of the General Assembly for quite some\ntime. Although the process of reform has proved to be a\ndifficult one, my delegation does not wish to see it\nprolonged, for we believe that its momentum cannot be\nmaintained indefinitely. However, it is important that we\nremain focused on the central issue of making this\nOrganization ready and capable of delivering the promise\nof peace, justice and prosperity for all human beings,\nirrespective of their colour, race, gender or belief, and the\npromise of providing the means to protect our\nenvironment and enjoy our fundamental freedoms. This\nmeans that reform should cover the United Nations\nsystem in its entirety.\nOn the specific question of the reform of the\nSecurity Council, my delegation appreciates the efforts of\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\nRelated to the Security Council. However, we remain\nconcerned about the lack of progress in its proceedings,\nand are worried about the prevailing difficulties which are\npreventing an early agreement on this important issue. We\nremain convinced of the importance of the early and\nsuccessful conclusion of the efforts to make the Security\nCouncil more responsive to and representative of the\ncurrent world realities in order to make it more effective.\nThe commitment of the Maldives to arms control,\ndisarmament and international peace and security remains\nunwavering. We are parties to all major multilateral\ninstruments relating to arms control and disarmament.\nSince its inception, we have been faithfully and regularly\ncontributing to the international Register of Conventional\nArms. We signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) last year and are presently going through\nthe process of ratifying it. This morning we have signed\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction.\nMy delegation is happy to note the considerable\nprogress the international community has made in the\nfield of arms control and disarmament, and commends the\nbilateral initiatives that have been proved to be so\nsuccessful. We believe that both bilateral and multilateral\napproaches must reinforce and complement each other if\nwe are to successfully achieve complete disarmament.\nIn my delegation\u2019s view, the establishment of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various\nregions of the world is a positive step towards achieving\nnuclear disarmament. At this juncture, we particularly\nstress the importance of the establishment of the proposed\n8\n\n\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, and take this\nopportunity to call upon all countries in South Asia to\nexercise maximum restraint and contribute to the realization\nof this noble objective.\nIn our quest to make the world a safer place we must\nnot think only of the big Powers and the big bangs.\nSecurity is indivisible, whether in terms of geography or\nrange of threat. The continuing scourge of terrorism, which\nrears its ugly and murderous head all too frequently, is as\nmuch the bane of international security today as is the\nspread of nuclear and other dangerous weapons. That\nterrorist groups may gain access to such weapons is an\nalarming thought. For small States the threats posed by\nterrorists are allied with and magnified by the activities of\ndrug-traffickers, money-launderers and other manifestations\nof organized crime. That is why we have acceded to many\ninternational conventions against terrorism and are actively\nconsidering acceding to the remaining conventions.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to repeat the\nappeal made by my President at the historic fiftieth\nanniversary commemorative session of this body for the\nsignature and early ratification of the International\nConvention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and\nTraining of Mercenaries in order to expedite its entry in to\nforce. My delegation believes that in the face of these\nthreats it is in the interest of the international community to\nprovide adequate safeguards for small States, which are in\nreality the front-line States against most of these evil deeds.\nWe are happy to see the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court. Those who perpetrate war\ncrimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity must\nnot be allowed to cross a border to safety or anonymity.\nThis is why an international court that can systematically\nprosecute major war criminals wherever they are has to be\nestablished. This need has become more urgent in this post-\ncold-war period, which is characterized by the proliferation\nof conflicts of unprecedented ferocity. The horrifying\ncrimes against humanity committed in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and elsewhere cannot\nbe allowed to recur at any time or at any place. The\nperpetrators of those crimes should be brought to justice.\nMy delegation strongly believes that the ultimate legal\nguarantee of peace and justice in the world lies in the\nstrength and resolve of the international community and not\nin the strength and resolve of a single country.\nIn conclusion, I once again would like to stress the\nvulnerability of small island developing States. My\ndelegation believes that urgent and immediate action is\nabsolutely necessary to alleviate the difficulties faced by\nthese countries due to environmental degradation. If the\npresent-day predictions for climate change were to come\ntrue, the Maldives and many other small island countries\nwould have to face the frightful reality of extinction.\nTime is running out. Let us do something immediately.\nOtherwise, we will be no more.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by\ncongratulating the President on his unanimous election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. I am confident that under his able leadership and\nwith his vast diplomatic experience, we shall have fruitful\ndeliberations and a successful session.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for the skill and sensitivity he\ndisplayed while presiding over the work of the General\nAssembly during its fifty-second session.\nMay I also take this opportunity to commend the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring\nefforts to build a prosperous United Nations through the\nongoing reforms to better meet the challenges of the next\nmillennium. Although adjustment and reorientation can\nsometimes be painful, I am confident that under\nMr. Annan's leadership the United Nations will continue\nto flourish. Kenya supports the Secretary-General in these\nefforts.\nThe General Assembly provides Member States with\nan opportunity to discuss and gain useful insights and\nperceptions on key global issues of common concern to\nthe international community, such as securing a stable,\n32\n\n\npeaceful and equitable world order. In this context, we\ncontinue to witness the presence of the United Nations in\npeacekeeping and peace-building, development programmes\nand humanitarian assistance in Africa, Europe, Asia and the\nAmericas.\nIn our own region, for example, I wish to mention the\ngood work of the Nairobi-based Great Lakes Programme,\nwhich operates under the auspices of the United Nations\nGreat Lakes Task Force on Relief, Reconstruction and\nDevelopment. This Programme is funded by the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and contributes\nimmensely to identifying the development priorities of the\nGreat Lakes countries as they endeavour to make a\ntransition from conflict to development. Furthermore,\nKenya appreciates the timely response by the United\nNations Disaster Management Team to drought and the\nfloods caused by El Ni\u00f1o. In addition, the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), with the support of the World Food Programme\n(WFP), continues to look after the needs of refugees in our\ncountry. All these efforts by United Nations agencies are\ncommendable and need to be encouraged and sustained.\nIn the last 10 years, we have witnessed significant\nadvances in democracy, respect for human rights and\ninternational cooperation. Unfortunately, this was also a\nperiod in which an estimated 4 million people were killed\nin armed conflicts. A majority of these conflicts, which\nnow threaten international peace and security, are of an\nintra-State rather than inter-State nature. Currently, there are\nup to 30 civil wars and a much larger number of lower-\nintensity conflicts being fought around the world. This new\npattern of conflicts comes with new problems and new\nchallenges for conflict resolution. There is a need, therefore,\nto review the existing conflict resolution mechanisms so as\nto meet these new challenges. As the Secretary-General?s\nSpecial Representative for Children and Armed Conflict\npointed out to the Security Council in June this year,\n\u201cBoth international and national actors need to take\npolitical, economic and social measures that can\ngenerate within communities a sense of hope in place\nof despair, a sense of inclusion and participation\ninstead of exclusion, a sense of belonging instead of\nalienation\u201d. (S/PV.3896, p. 5)\nThe credibility of the international community is\nanchored in its ability to dispense just and sometimes\nradical solutions to important questions. I have in mind the\ncommendable resolve of the world community to punish the\nperpetrators of war crimes and other violations of\ninternational humanitarian law. In this connection, Kenya\nwelcomes the work of the International Criminal\nTribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, as well\nas the International Criminal Court, which shall soon\nbecome a reality. The international community must\ndemonstrate its resolve to pursue such criminal elements\nwhoever and wherever they are.\nKenya supports the legitimization and strengthening\nof regional bodies in peacekeeping. The Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), under the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) in West Africa, stand out as examples of regional\norganizations that have contributed immensely to\npeacekeeping in conflict situations. I should also underline\nthe commendable role played by the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States and the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe in the conflicts in Croatia; Bosnia\nand Herzegovina; Albania; Abkhazia, Georgia; and\ncurrently in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia.\nIn Africa, the forces of the ECOWAS Monitoring\nGroup (ECOMOG) reinstalled the democratically elected\nGovernment of President Kabbah of Sierra Leone and\nrestored constitutional order in Liberia. The superb\nperformance of the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB) in\nthe Central African Republic also deserves\ncommendation. In the Eastern African region, the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\ncontinues to promote political dialogue between the\nwarring factions in the Sudan and Somalia. In southern\nAfrica, the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) has embarked on initiatives to address, inter alia,\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThese regional organizations have made significant\nprogress in conflict resolution and should be given due\nrecognition and the necessary support. However, I would\nlike to emphasize that the responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security remains\nprimarily with the United Nations Security Council.\nThe holding of special meetings on the causes of\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa underscored the need\nfor a concerted international effort to promote peace and\nsecurity in our continent. During the special meeting on\nAfrica held in September 1997 and the follow-up meeting\nof 24 September 1998, the Security Council observed\nthat, despite the progress achieved by some African\n33\n\n\nStates, the number and intensity of armed conflicts on the\ncontinent remained a matter of grave concern. We share the\nview of the Secretary-General that durable peace and\neconomic development go hand in hand. Kenya welcomes\nthe challenge posed by the Secretary-General in the three\nbroad areas he emphasized in his report: the necessity for\nAfrica to rely on political rather than military responses to\nproblems; the need to summon the political will to seriously\npromote good governance, human rights and democracy;\nand, finally, the necessity to undertake and adhere to\nvarious reforms necessary to promote political stability and\neconomic growth.\nWhile the general tendency is to seek ways of\ndeepening political cooperation and economic integration,\nthe unity and stability of some States, especially on the\nAfrican continent, is being threatened by ethnic, social and\nother intra-State conflicts. In particular, conflicts in the\nGreat Lakes region, Somalia and southern Sudan \u2014 and,\nmore recently, the inter-State conflict between Ethiopia and\nEritrea \u2014 are of major concern to us. Kenya has been and\nwill continue to be involved in efforts aimed at reducing\ntension in Africa and, indeed, beyond.\nIn 1996 and 1997, Kenya hosted the various Nairobi\nsummits on the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and, indeed, the conflict in the southern Sudan,\nunder the auspices of IGAD. More recently, President Moi\nmet separately with the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea in\nan effort to secure their commitment to pursuing\nnegotiations rather than war in their border dispute. These\nefforts have helped to complement the important initiatives\nof the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity\nand others and have, in our view, contributed to ensuring\nthe avoidance of a full-scale war between Ethiopia and\nEritrea. I trust the necessary goodwill exists for a negotiated\nfinal settlement in this conflict.\nRegarding Somalia, we are concerned about the lack\nof progress in the efforts to restore normalcy and statehood\nto that country. Both the IGAD and the Cairo initiatives\nhave stalled. However, the cessation of hostilities; the\nagreement by the warring factions in Mogadishu to have a\njoint administration for the hitherto divided city; and the\nreopening of the harbour and airport are encouraging. It is\nour hope that the parties concerned will resume serious\ndialogue sooner rather than later.\nIn June this year, the Security Council held an open\ndebate on children and armed conflict. This is a matter of\nparticular interest to Africa, where there are horrifying\naccounts of atrocities to which children are subject or in\nwhich they participate. We are painfully aware of the\ndisturbing new phenomenon of \u201carmed labour\u201d in some\nparts of Africa and are therefore concerned about the\npossibility that children could be involved in these\nactivities. There is the added dimension of the easy\navailability of illegal small arms which, as pointed out\nlast week by Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen of the\nNetherlands, have the potential of destabilizing the whole\nregion.\nChildren are our future and all should continue to\nsupport the work of the Secretary-General and his Special\nRepresentative to safeguard and protect them in areas of\narmed conflict. To that end, my delegation reiterates the\nneed for strict compliance by all Member States with the\nrelevant provisions of international law.\nKenya believes that the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a crucial\nstep in the fulfilment of one of the main objectives in the\nimplementation of relevant obligations under the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We believe\nthat our common objective should lead to complete\nnuclear disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States.\nIt is regrettable that the perceived lack of serious\ncommitment by nuclear-weapon States to moving rapidly\ntowards genuine disarmament recently provided an excuse\nfor others to conduct nuclear tests. There is therefore a\nneed for security assurances from non-nuclear-weapon\nStates and, even more importantly, for urgent measures\nand renewed efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.\nWe expect the nuclear-weapon States to take their\nresponsibilities seriously by seizing the initiative towards\nthe total elimination of nuclear weapons from our planet.\nThe process of development during the past decade\nhas been uneven. A number of developing countries\nrecorded high rates of growth and have been able to\naccelerate development. However, many of the developing\ncountries, especially those in Africa, have made modest\nprogress. The disparities in economic growth among\ndeveloping countries have largely widened. These\nconditions have taken place against a backdrop of rapid\nchanges in the world economy, characterized by the twin\nprocesses of globalization and liberalization, which have\nbecome the hallmark of global economic policy. The\npreferential treatment enjoyed by a large number of\ndeveloping countries under the Generalized System of\nPreferences and other preferential trading arrangements,\nsuch as the Lom\u00e9 Convention, continues to be eroded.\n34\n\n\nIt is imperative for the international community to\nstrengthen commodity-dependent countries by means of\nexpanded market access for their products, as well as\nsupport in the development of their technical and human\ncapacities so that they may actively participate in the\nmultilateral trading system. In this regard, my delegation\nwould like to urge the effective implementation of the\nUruguay Round results, especially with regard to market\naccess for goods and services of export interest to\ndeveloping countries.\nDeveloping countries, especially those in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, have, during the past decade, undertaken many\nefforts aimed at attracting foreign direct investment.\nUnfortunately, these efforts have not yielded any significant\ninflows. International capital flows play an important role\nin the process of development. Kenya reiterates the need for\nincreased access to international financial markets for the\nacquisition of finance on concessionary terms by developing\ncountries. In this context, Kenya attaches great importance\nto the convening of an international conference on financing\nfor development under the auspices of the United Nations.\nThe liberalization of financial transactions and the\nincreasing freedom of capital mobility have become\nimportant policy objectives for many countries. The\nresultant need to grapple with massive international capital\nflows, coupled with the experiences of financial turbulence\nand turmoil in some Asian economies, has highlighted the\nneed to reform the international financial system. On the\nAsian financial crisis, my delegation wishes to advocate\nmeasures aimed at the restoration of stability in the affected\ncountries to avoid serious negative consequences around the\nglobe.\nThe external debt problem of low-income developing\ncountries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, remains\nunresolved. The international community is called upon to\ntake actions aimed at finding lasting solutions to the debt\nproblem. On official bilateral debt, while we are gratified\nat the adoption of the Naples terms by the Paris Club, the\nslow pace of their implementation continues to be of\nconcern. Kenya wishes to urge the Paris Club of creditor\ncountries to revise the eligibility criteria so as to allow for\nthe inclusion of all low-income developing countries. The\nproblem of multilateral debt also needs to be accorded\nserious attention, taking into account issues such as\nincreased concessional finance, debt cancellation, debt\nreduction and debt relief.\nMy delegation would like to express concern over the\ndeclining trend in real terms of official development\nassistance over the years. In this regard, Kenya wishes to\ncall for the expeditious reversal of this trend by donor\ncountries in line with their commitments in various\nUnited Nations resolutions and with the aim of meeting\nthe internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product. The interdependence of the global\neconomy makes it necessary for those of us in the\ndeveloping world to call upon the international\ncommunity, including the United Nations agencies,\ninternational financial institutions and multilateral and\nbilateral donors, to support the implementation of\nstrategies for the development of the developing countries\nand to give priority to financing for development and\nexpansion of trade in those countries through mobilization\nof new and additional resources.\nKenya welcomes the appointment of Mr. Klaus\nT\u00f6pfer as Director-General of the United Nations Office\nat Nairobi and the elevation of the Nairobi centre to the\nlevel of other United Nations centres at Vienna and\nGeneva. As the United Nations proceeds with reform\nmeasures to ensure the efficient use of resources, it is\nimperative for the Organization to ensure maximal and\nrational use of existing facilities within the system to\nminimize waste. As host to the only United Nations\ncentre in the developing world, we are concerned that\nfacilities at the Nairobi Office continue to be\nunderutilized. Kenya would appreciate seeing maximal\nutilization of facilities at the headquarters of the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United\nNations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT) to try\nand reach the capacity-utilization levels of Geneva and\nVienna. In this regard, we wish to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for the various measures he has taken, aimed at\nimproving this situation. Kenya, however, still urges that\nthe various General Assembly resolutions on this matter\nbe adhered to.\nWe also note that both UNEP and HABITAT need\nto be strengthened by streamlining their administrative\nand financial management. In this connection. Kenya\nwelcomes the establishment of the Task Force on\nEnvironment and Human Settlements, whose task is to\nprovide recommendations for new measures to strengthen\nand restructure those two organizations on the basis of\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 2997 (XXVII) and 32/162,\nwhile taking into account decisions and recommendations\nof the Governing Council of UNEP and the Commission\non Human Settlements. The report of the Task Force\ncaptures the challenges we continue to face in this area.\nIt states that human demands on the global life-support\nsystem continue to mount as poverty and affluence spread\n35\n\n\nin parallel around the globe. Despite all the efforts made\nsince the United Nations Conference on the Human\nEnvironment, held at Stockholm, the environment continues\nto deteriorate in many parts of the world. Certain social,\neconomic and technological trends are exacerbating these\nproblems. Against this background, it is imperative that\nUNEP be strengthened through the provision of adequate\nand predictable financial resources to better execute its\nmandate, and that more vigorous and coordinated action be\ntaken to respond effectively to these problems. In line with\nresolution 52/220, Kenya urges that energetic steps be taken\non the funding from the regular budget of the United\nNations Office at Nairobi in order to enable it to discharge\nits mandate.\nMy delegation welcomes this opportunity to express its\noutrage at and condemnation of the criminal and unjustified\nterrorist bombings which occurred simultaneously in\nNairobi and in Dar-es-Salaam on 7 August 1998. Terrorist\nacts are by design ruthlessly indiscriminate, and the bomb\nblast in Nairobi, which occurred at one of the busiest\nlocations in the city in terms of human traffic and\ncommercial activities, was no exception. It has so far\nclaimed 250 lives, and the death toll continues to rise.\nDamage estimated at over $500 million was caused by the\nbomb blast.\nThe bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam brought\nmayhem and terror of an untold magnitude to our two\ncountries, which had hitherto considered themselves secure\nand far removed from the threats and dangers posed by acts\nof international terrorism. These two incidents not only\nmake it abundantly clear that nobody is safe or unaffected\nby such heinous acts, but also exemplify the expanding\nreach and growing menace of the perpetrators of terrorist\nacts.\nLet me take this opportunity on behalf of the\nGovernment of Kenya to express gratitude for the generous\nassistance and support promptly made available in the\nrescue efforts by Governments and international\norganizations, and by volunteers who came from far and\nwide.\nKenya welcomes the General Assembly?s adoption\nearlier this year of the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings. In this regard, we wish\nto underscore the importance of enhancing international\ncooperation to combat terrorism in accordance with the\nrelevant international instruments. We support the proposal\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries calling for the\nconvening of an international conference under the auspices\nof the United Nations to formulate an organized and\nconcerted response by the international community to\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that Kenya will\ncontinue to participate actively in the work of the\nOrganization and to bear its rightful share of\nresponsibilities and obligations under the Charter. As we\nenter the new millennium, we should all contribute to the\neffort to chart a new course for a reinvigorated United\nNations in a manner that fulfils the vision of its founders\nand meets the challenge of our generation and of\ngenerations to come.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I speak to this Assembly with a sense of deference\nand humility. Deference, because I realize that I am\nspeaking to the greatest multilateral organization of all time\nand from a rostrum where have stood almost all the great\nstatesmen since the Second World War.\nHumility because I was appointed just two months ago\nto the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs, and so I am a\nnewcomer for most of the delegates. However, this is no\nway detracts from the pride that I feel regarding my\ncountry?s long commitment to the United Nations system\nand the support that this Organization has enjoyed in the\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\nI would also like to add that I feel reassured to realize\nthat most of what I was going to say to the Assembly has\nalready been said in the statement made by the Austrian\nMinister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the European\nUnion.\n(spoke in English)\nArticle 23 of the United Nations Charter says that the\nGeneral Assembly shall elect 10 non-permanent members\nof the Security Council. More to the point, the Article goes\non to say that the Assembly, in doing so, must pay due\nregard\n\u201cin the first instance to the contribution of Members\nof the United Nations to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and to the other\npurposes of the Organization\u201d.\nWell, my country at present is up for election to the\nSecurity Council. In fact, elections are due to be held in\nthis very Hall in a few weeks time. And so it seems only\nfair for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as a candidate\nfor the Council, to explain where it stands: where it\nstands on some of the core issues now faced by the\nUnited Nations family, where its stands on the state of\naffairs in the Organization and where it stands on the\nOrganization?s future. In other words, what is the\nelectorate looking at?\nWhat the electorate is looking at is what I would\ndescribe as a nation responding. Throughout the Kingdom\npeople hear the wants of the world, the needs of our\nneighbours and of people in peril. It is in keeping with\nthe Dutch character to be penny-pinching but generous to\nthose in distress, to be demanding but tough on ourselves\nas well, to hold strong views but carry a big heart \u2014\neasily critical, prone to compassion.\nIn much the same manner we look at this\nOrganization. We look at the Charter as a true monument\nof modern times. We feel a strong commitment to\nmultilateralism, for reasons of principle and for reasons of\nnecessity. We seek to promote the institutions of\nworldwide cooperation, with the United Nations at the\ncore. Together, they span the entire range of human\nactivity. We shall go on to give it the best we can offer\nin the form of ideas and in the form of resources.\nI would like to demonstrate how seriously we take\nour Charter obligations by showing how, over the years,\nwe have pursued the purposes of the United Nations, as\nspelled out by the Charter in Article 1. First, peace and\nsecurity. It is perhaps the most thankless responsibility the\nUnited Nations carries. Indeed, the odds are\noverwhelming. Since 1945, the number of violent\nconflicts outstanding has risen from 4 to about 40. Their\naverage length has grown from about two months to an\naverage of 14.5 months in 1995. Peace and security is\nwhere we have learned our lessons the hard way, and\nmore mistakes are bound to be made. We, the Member\nStates, need to shape up.\nMeanwhile, the Dutch commitment to United\nNations peacekeeping is borne out by our record. The\nNetherlands has taken part in 20 peacekeeping operations\nso far, is currently engaged in three of them and is getting\nready to join a fourth one. Most recently, some 100 Dutch\ntroops were stationed in Cyprus, where they are\ncommitted to keeping the two Cypriot communities at\npeace. All in all, some 1,650 Dutch troops are engaged in\npeacekeeping and multinational supervision. In fact,\npeacekeeping operations continue to form one of the\n25\n\n\nprincipal tasks of our armed forces, and we remain ready to\nparticipate in up to four different peacekeeping efforts\nsimultaneously at the level of a battalion.\nPeacekeeping does not stand by itself. There should be\na comprehensive response to the need for conflict\nmanagement. We believe in a continuum between\nprevention, on the one hand, and reconstruction and\ndevelopment on the other hand. After all, many of the\nconflicts raging today take place in the developing world.\nAffluent societies cannot in good conscience walk away\nfrom a conflict once the smoke has cleared. Donor\ncountries cannot turn their backs to the ravages of war and\nconcentrate on the next CNN headlines. We believe that\nemergency aid and political initiatives should be teamed\nwith longer-term development planning, reconstruction and\nreconciliation. We believe in building a bridge between\nconflict and development.\nAnother pillar of Dutch foreign policy is our strong\ndesire to ban weapons of mass destruction. Our objective\nremains strengthening the non-proliferation regime,\nsupporting real progress in negotiations on the reduction of\nnuclear weapons, and making existing conventions on other\nmega-weapons effective and more reliable.\nStill, we are not talking only about mega-weapons.\nThe transfer of small arms is a matter of concern for us as\nwell. They are piling up fast, most of them illicit. In many\ncountries they constitute a serious threat to the population\nand to national and regional security and even contribute to\nthe destabilization of States.\nLandmines are the plague of modern warfare, leaving\na disgraceful legacy of the present century to the next one.\nOnce in the ground, they keep. To this day people are\nmaimed or killed in Ypres, Belgium, by landmines put in\nplace during the first strategic use of them, over 80 years\nago. Mine clearance and banning anti-personnel landmines\nhave been pursued with renewed vigour in recent years, and\nwith due reason.\nI now turn to the second of the purposes of the United\nNations: developing friendly relations among nations. Let\nme point to the manner and measure in which the\nNetherlands has contributed towards this.\nBy geographical necessity, the Netherlands has always\nbeen a seafaring nation, a nation of traders. Besides making\nus the eighth largest trading nation in the world, it has\nmade us an outward-looking people, internationally\noriented. Also, it has made us a multicultural society. Over\n20 per cent of our population have their origins abroad \u2014\nin Africa, in Asia, in the Arab world and in the Americas.\nOver time, we have built up strong relations with\ncountries of all regions. Two constituent parts of our\nKingdom, that is to say the Netherlands Antilles and\nAruba, are located in the Americas. Our Caribbean\nKingdom partners have important political and economic\nrelations with their regional friends. They are engaged in\nthe Economic Commission for Latin America and the\nCaribbean (ECLAC), in the Organization of American\nStates (OAS) and in the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM).\nRightfully, Africa is high on the Netherlands?\npolitical and development agendas. We encourage and\nsupport African countries in establishing peace, stability\nand democracy. We assist African nations in building up\ntheir mechanism for conflict prevention, management and\nresolution. We help Africa in strengthening its place in\nthe world economy \u2014 for instance, through the World\nTrade Organization. Dutch aid flows to all countries of\nAfrica \u2014 last year over $600 million worth.\nTurning now to Asia, the relations between the\nNetherlands and a large number of Asian countries go\nback to the sixteenth century. We are an original member\nof the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP). Naturally, therefore, we have assisted\nAsian countries that have been hit by the financial crisis\nand its economic and social effects. We do so through\nmultilateral channels and through joint European and\nAsian initiatives. Overcoming the crisis is important, too,\nfor political stability in the region.\nAs regards Central and Eastern Europe, the\nNetherlands is heavily engaged in assisting countries of\nthat region in their transition to market economy and\ndemocracy. Our involvement is a central feature in our\nrelations with all candidates for accession to the European\nUnion. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are at present the\nthird most important donor, and we contribute to the\nStabilization Force and to various organizations engaged\nin the region.\nThe Netherlands and the Arab world have long-\nstanding economic and cultural ties. The University of\nLeyden has traditionally been a leading centre for the\nstudy of Islam and Arab culture. We have a growing\nArab community in the Netherlands. We continue to give\nsubstantial support to the Palestinian people and are a\n26\n\n\nmajor donor to the United Nations Relief and Works\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\nThe third purpose of the United Nations, as spelt out\nin Article 1 of the Charter, is by far the most complex. Its\nbinding element is the promotion of international\ncooperation, but cooperation in fields that, taken together,\ncover a wide range of human interaction. I would like to\nhighlight some of them, without, of course, meaning to\ndiminish any of the others. Notably, I will touch on\ndevelopment cooperation, human rights, and international\nlaw.\nPoverty eradication has been the primary focus of\nDutch development aid policy for over a quarter of a\ncentury. The Netherlands, whose aid programme last year\nran close to $3 billion, has actively tried to strike a balance\nin its aid policy between the economy, the environment and\nthe people. We are pursuing development that is\nsustainable \u2014 sustainable not purely in terms of ecology\nbut in a wider sense: development that addresses basic\nhuman needs, that respects human rights, that builds human\ncapacities, that is socially responsible and that does not\nmortgage the choices of future generations.\nFor many years, my country has been more than\nfaithful to the international target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product for development. The Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development average hovers\naround 0.25 per cent. The Netherlands stands at a self-\nimposed 0.8 per cent. In percentage terms, it takes third\nplace among the major donors. In absolute terms, in money\nspent, it has made us the sixth largest donor country\nworldwide for 1997.\nAll in all, $750 million from Dutch resources flowed\nto the United Nations system and to the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions in 1997. The new Netherlands Government is a\nstrong believer in multilateral development cooperation. In\nits first major policy statement, it pledged that multilateral\naid flows, including those to the United Nations system, are\ngoing to be expanded over the next several years.\nAs the Charter says explicitly, international\ncooperation applies also to promoting and encouraging\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We\nhave made no secret of our attachment to the cause of\nhuman rights in the past; nor do we intend to hide it in the\nyears to come. The Netherlands has been an active player\nin the Commission on Human Rights since at least 1980,\nhas seen several of its countrymen serve in prominent\nhuman rights positions, has either drafted or supported\ncountless resolutions and has strongly advocated standard-\nsetting and monitoring. It is a topic that enjoys solid\nsupport in Dutch society and has constituted a clear\npolitical imperative for a quarter of a century. Member\nStates can count on our toeing the line in the future.\nPromoting respect for the rule of law at the\ninternational level has been recognized as part of our\nheritage ever since Hugo Grotius, in the early 1600s. In\nmodern times, the Netherlands has sought to contribute to\nthe advancement of international law. Areas where we\nhave made contributions include human rights, legal\ncooperation, crime prevention, criminal justice and so\nforth. Much of the groundwork for the International\nCriminal Court was done under Dutch chairmanship.\nIf indeed we are to serve on the Security Council,\nwhat will be our aims in the next two years? Our aim is\nthe primacy of international law. Our aim is building\nbridges. Our aim is addressing all issues before the\nCouncil. Our aim is more contact between non-members\nand the Council. And our aim is openness and\ntransparency. In a nutshell, we will be driven by idealism,\nbut guided by realism. It is in that spirit that we approach\nour membership in the Council and, indeed, the future of\nthis Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your country, Uruguay, has given\nconsistent and strong support to the United Nations, and\nyour own expertise and contribution to the development of\ninternational law in particular is widely recognized. We\nknow that we are in good hands, just as we were last year\nwith your predecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko. Like him, you\nmay count on Australia\u00e2s support as you carry out your\nresponsibilities and work to guide us towards constructive\nand worthwhile outcomes.\nAs was very clear from the range of issues addressed\non the first day and again this morning in the general\ndebate, you take up the presidency, Sir, at a time when the\nagenda before the United Nations is more challenging than\nit has ever been. Australia is very concerned about many of\nthose challenges and issues. But today I want to focus\nparticularly on the subject of non-proliferation and\ndisarmament, where recent events have brought us to a\ncrossroads in our attempts to steer the world away from the\nthreat of weapons of mass destruction.\nAlthough we heard some pessimistic perspectives\nyesterday, in Australia\u00e2s view the progress that the\ninternational community has made in the field of arms\ncontrol and disarmament over recent decades has, in fact,\nbeen remarkable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a trend to which the end of the cold\nwar lent added impetus. Many bilateral, regional and\ninternational agreements have been concluded, all making\na contribution to making our world more secure. Those\nachievements were driven by the realization that we must\nwork with determination towards a situation where the right\nto self-defence of all nations, which is, after all, enshrined\nin the United Nations Charter, must be ensured at the\nlowest possible level of conventional armament and without\nrecourse at all to weapons of mass destruction. Events\nwhich have moved against the tide of this progress have\nbeen relatively rare, but when they have occurred they have\nstood in stark contrast to the preferred direction of the\ninternational community.\nA survey of the progress made to date in the field of\narms control and disarmament points to two key\nconclusions. The first is self-evident: there is more work to\nbe done. The second is perhaps easier to overlook. In the\nface of periodic setbacks and challenges, it is vitally\nimportant, and in the security interests of all countries, that\nwe stay the course on arms control and disarmament, that\nwe not underestimate or take for granted the value of what\nhas been achieved to date, and that we maintain the broad-\nbased political commitment to the norms and institutions\nthat we have put in place or have yet to build.\nA stock-take of progress in arms control and\ndisarmament over recent decades leaves no doubt about\nthe positive direction in which the community is moving\nin building a global security architecture. In addition to\nagreements on conventional arms limitation and\ntransparency measures, the balance sheet for weapons of\nmass destruction is particularly impressive.\nA Treaty banning an entire category of weapons of\nmass destruction \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Chemical Weapons\nConvention \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was successfully negotiated and has\nattracted widespread support, and efforts are under way to\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention.\nA milestone Treaty now exists \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\nwhich bans all nuclear-weapon test explosions and all\nother nuclear explosions.\nLong called-for by political leaders from across all\nregions, hard-negotiated in the Conference on\nDisarmament and finally adopted by the Assembly by an\noverwhelming majority two years ago, the CTBT has now\nattracted the adherence of over 150 States, and its\ninstitutional fabric is being steadily established.\nThe cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation\nregime \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has been extended indefinitely and\nhas achieved near-universal membership, and agreement\nhas been reached to commence negotiations to ban the\nproduction of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons.\nIn another area, under the strategic arms reductions\nprocess, or START, and consistent with article VI of the\nNPT, deep cuts have been made in the cold-war arsenals\nof the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons, bringing\ncloser the day when plurilateral and multilateral phases of\nnuclear disarmament can realistically be envisaged.\nWith START I almost fully implemented, the United\nStates and the Russian Federation, from which we have\njust heard, have more than halved their holdings of\nstrategic nuclear warheads over the past decade. START\nIII will bring those same arsenals down to some 80 per\ncent below cold-war peaks. It is clearly very important for\nSTART II to enter into force quickly so that planning for\nimplementation can begin, ensuring there is no\ninterruption to the nuclear disarmament process.\nThe international nuclear safeguards systems have\nalso been strengthened, enhancing international confidence\nin the integrity of this regime and its ability to detect and\n24\n\n\ndeter non-compliance with non-proliferation obligations.\nAnd finally, a treaty banning landmines \u00e2\u20ac\u201d what some have\ncalled weapons of mass destruction in slow motion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has\nbeen concluded.\nOn the other side of the ledger, the non-proliferation\nand disarmament regimes have had to withstand serious\nchallenges from the Democratic People\u00e2s Republic of Korea\nand from Iraq, and the progress towards a universal no-\nnuclear-testing norm has been seriously jolted by sporadic\noutbreaks of testing, most recently by India and Pakistan.\nUnresolved regional tensions in South Asia and the Middle\nEast continue to bedevil and to thwart the attainment of the\ngoal of universal membership of the NPT. While being\njustifiably dismayed at the disdain of the few for the clearly\nexpressed will of the international community, we can also\ndraw encouragement from the strength of our national and\ncollective responses to these challenges and the resilience\nof the regimes when so challenged.\nIt is vitally important that we stay the course, that we\nensure that such events amount to no more than temporary\ndeviations from the near-universally accepted norm against\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We\nbelieve that this is in Australia\u00e2s national interest and in the\ninterest of international and regional security to uphold the\nnuclear and other non-proliferation regimes and to continue\nto do our utmost to pursue effective measures to reduce and\neliminate the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.\nIn a strange way, the periodic setbacks to these efforts\nserve to underscore the value of the progress made to date.\nThe very existence of the NPT, and its near-universal\nmembership, highlights the unacceptability of embarking\nupon a nuclear-weapon programme in today\u00e2s world.\nSimilarly, it is the very existence of the CTBT, and the\nnear-universal point of view it represents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d namely, that\nnuclear testing should be a thing of the past \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that\nrendered more powerful the widespread disapproval of the\nspate of nuclear tests earlier this year. The new ratifications\nwhich the CTBT attracted following the South Asian\nnuclear tests were eloquent testimony to the confidence of\nthe international community in and its commitment to the\nno-testing norm.\nAustralia would like to take this public opportunity to\ncongratulate Brazil and to welcome it as the most recent\nmember of the family of NPT nations. We call on that\nhandful of States remaining outside the NPT to reflect on\nthe possibility that the 187 countries which have decided\nthat the NPT provides greater security than the nuclear-\nweapons option might be right, and that they \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the\noutsiders \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might be wrong. Australia also calls on them\nto consider how much more seriously their national\nsecurity interests would be degraded in a world where the\noverwhelming majority of States had not embraced the\nnuclear non-proliferation norm.\nMy country, as I think is well known, has long been\na very firm supporter of universal adherence to treaties on\ninternational weapons of mass destruction. We have\nsigned all 13 multilateral arms control and disarmament\ntreaties and ratified all of these bar one; ratification of the\nOttawa Convention on landmines, I am happy to say, is\nin progress. Only four other countries can match this\nrecord. We remain committed to making a difference\nwhere and when we can in building consensus on the way\nforward, and we will continue to be as diligent and as\ncreative as possible across the full range of arms-control\nand disarmament issues.\nOur focus, for those who know us well, is always on\nresults rather than rhetoric and on making pragmatic\ncontributions where we can, illustrated by the sort of\ncontributions that we have made to helping to negotiate\nthe key Conventions to which I have referred and by our\nsupport for building and strengthening the institutions\nwhich work in various ways to support international arms-\ncontrol and disarmament goals \u00e2\u20ac\u201d institutions such as the\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the\nKorean Peninsula Energy Development Organization\n(KEDO), the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) Regional Forum and the nuclear safeguards\nsystem.\nExperience has shown that these regimes cannot be\ntaken for granted. The existing regimes need continual\ncare, maintenance and vigilance to ensure that they\nremain effective and that political and financial\ncommitment to them remains strong.\nIn the NPT area, for example, further work is needed\nto maintain the strength of the Treaty and to go on to\nachieve its full implementation and universality. The sixth\nReview Conference, in the year 2000, following on the\nrecent serious challenges to the non-proliferation norm, to\nwhich I have referred, will be one of the most significant\nin the history of the Treaty. But even if we have a\ndistance to go in terms of the Treaty\u00e2s value, surely no\none would argue that the world would be a safer place\nwithout it. Nor could it be argued that the negotiation of\nthe Treaty back in the late 1960s, and the maintenance\nand strengthening of the Treaty ever since, has not been\nworth the effort.\n25\n\n\nAnd to those few who persist with the tired refrain\nthat the NPT is a discriminatory Treaty, we say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, it is\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\nand for one excellent reason: the NPT allows a temporary\nstate of discrimination between the nuclear-weapon States\nand the rest of us because, quite simply, the alternative was,\nand still is, too horrible to contemplate. We might lament\nthat because of the cold war the state of discrimination\nlasted far too long, but we surely cannot argue that the\nalternative scenario would have made the world a safer\nplace than it is today. For it was a commonplace of\npolitical forecasts in the 1960s, when nuclear weapons were\na legitimate security option for any State, that over 20\nStates, including my own, Australia, would likely choose to\nexercise that option.\nAnd it is surely perverse, when the titanic arsenals of\nnuclear weapons accumulated during the cold war are at\nlast being drastically cut, to act against the tide of\ndisarmament by pursuing the nuclear option.\nSimilarly, no one could argue that we would be better\noff without a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Its\nconclusion, its signature by the five nuclear-weapon States\nand its ratification to date by two are major\nachievements \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all the more reason to press ahead with\nthe establishment of the Treaty\u00e2s implementation and\nverification structures.\nA strong start has been made in implementing the\nChemical Weapons Convention. Its effectiveness is already\namply demonstrated, but we need continued political will\nand financial commitment, as well as the additional\nratifications and accessions, for the full security benefits of\nthe Convention to be realized.\nSimilarly, the Biological Weapons Convention is\nweakened by its lack of verification and compliance\nprovisions. Work is now under way in the Ad Hoc Group\nnegotiations to rectify this deficiency. We strongly support\nthis Ad Hoc Group and are working together with others to\nproduce an effective and workable protocol to strengthen\nthe Biological Weapons Convention.\nOne of the things that we have been doing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and\npeople may have seen the reference to a meeting about this\nin today\u00e2s Journal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has been to work collaboratively with\nmany other countries to convene an informal meeting of\nForeign Ministers. This informal meeting is going to be\nheld tomorrow, here in New York, and it represents the\ndetermination of many countries, at high political levels, to\nwork together to bring us closer to the goal of an early\nconclusion of an effective protocol to strengthen the\nBiological Weapons Convention.\nIn conjunction with the international community\u00e2s\nefforts to achieve full implementation and universality of\nexisting regimes, we also need new, reinforcing and\ncomplementary steps to achieve our overall arms control\nand disarmament goals.\nCommencement of negotiations for a fissile material\ncut-off treaty is an excellent example of how we should\nbe moving forward in this respect. We see it as the next\nlogical step after the CTBT, and it is one to which we\nhope the Assembly will lend unequivocal support and\nencouragement. The recent agreement in the Conference\non Disarmament in Geneva to commence negotiations on\na cut-off treaty demonstrates, we believe, the resilience of\nthe non-proliferation regime under pressure. It gives the\nlie to those who recently pronounced it dead. It is a sign\nof the international community reaffirming its faith in the\nnon-proliferation principle to which it has been committed\nfor the past 30 years.\nI want to refer very briefly to three more subjects:\nUnited Nations reform, human rights and peacekeeping.\nLike most other Member States, we want this\nOrganization to work better. Some progress has been\nmade. We welcomed the agreement reached on key\nelements of the Secretary-General\u00e2s reform package.\nIndeed, we worked hard and quietly to help bring this\nabout. But it is now very important to ensure that what\nhas been agreed is effectively implemented \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that the\ntask force and the reviews of specific aspects of United\nNations organizations all actually produce concrete\noutcomes and that real change does in fact occur.\nCritical to the achievement of real reform will be the\nresolution of the ongoing problem of non-payment of\narrears in financial contributions. The failure of many\nMember States, including the major contributor, to\naddress this situation hinders all our efforts to strengthen\nthis Organization.\nAlso, much of the reform process to us appears to\nhave been focused on rationalizing and refining structures\nand mechanisms and on administrative measures. We\nthink that the next phase of the reform process has to give\nmuch more structured thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and I believe that this\nis what the Secretary-General has in mind in his\npresentations to date on the Millennium Assembly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to\nthe kind of United Nations we expect and want in the\ndecades to come. A thorough review of priorities is\noverdue. Although the lofty ideals enshrined in the United\nNations Charter remain as valid as ever, we need to give\nserious thought to modernizing the ways in which we\n26\n\n\ngive effect to those objectives in terms of operational\nactivities.\nAustralia is concerned, like so many others who have\nspoken in the general debate to date, that the debate on\nSecurity Council reform has stalled. We have had an\nexhaustive \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but, regrettably, inconclusive \u00e2\u20ac\u201d discussion\nover the last year. It is time now to move beyond general\ndiscussion to serious negotiation of a reform package, one\nwhich will usher in a remodelled Council that is more\nrepresentative, transparent and suited to the new\nmillennium. This will require serious engagement and\nflexibility from all involved. My Government remains\ncommitted to finding ways to move the debate forward.\nThose of you who were here at last year\u00e2s session of\nthe General Assembly may recall that Foreign Minister\nDowner raised the issue of electoral groups. We continue\nto assert that this is an important element in the reform\ndebate. It is over 30 years since the last significant change\nwas made to the regional groups. The drawbacks of the\npresent configuration are becoming more and more obvious:\nsubstantial disparities in the size of the various groups and\nan inadequate level of representation available to many\nsubregions, including Australia\u00e2s own geographical area of\nEast Asia and the Pacific. We have noted that there is\ngathering interest among Member States in this subject, and\nwe think it is time that we recognized it as an element of\nreform which needs to be addressed. Changing the groups\nto reflect better contemporary realities and the interests of\nthe current membership will, we recognize, require careful\nthought and patient discussion, and it is simply far too early\nto put forward any particular formula. But we suggest we\ncould begin by discussing the principles on which a new\nsystem could be built and by exchanging views in a\nthoughtful and non-acrimonious way on how we might take\nthe process forward.\nThe year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and also 50 years\nof United Nations peacekeeping. Australia\u00e2s commitment to\nupholding the fundamental human rights enshrined in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights remains as strong\nnow as it was in 1948, when the Declaration was\nproclaimed. Members may not know that Australia was one\nof the eight countries tasked with the drafting of the\nDeclaration and that we also played an important role in\nensuring that human rights provisions were included in the\nUnited Nations Charter. Fifty years ago, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights represented a common\nstatement of goals and aspirations, a vision of the world as\nthe international community would want it to become.\nWe still believe in that vision and we see the fiftieth\nanniversary as a time for the international community to\nreaffirm its commitment to this powerful document.\nSimilarly, the 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping\ngives us an opportunity to recognize how far the\ninstitution of peacekeeping has come, to take stock of the\nlessons we have learnt from the past and, perhaps most\nimportantly, to pay tribute to over 1,500 peacekeepers\nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice for a safer and\nmore peaceful world.\nWhether we are talking of old problems or new\nones, whether we are analysing setbacks or successes, or\nmarking anniversaries, the annual stocktake which this\ngeneral debate represents offers the opportunity not for a\nseries of set speeches unrelated to each other and ticking\noff a lot of subjects, but rather a chance to remind\nourselves of what the United Nations stands for, to\nrecognize what has been achieved to date, and to\nrecommit ourselves for the future to protecting and\nadvancing those achievements.\nI have focused today on disarmament not only as an\narea of the utmost priority for Australia and Australians,\nbut also as one where we believe we can add value. But\nthe parallels and lessons of disarmament and non-\nproliferation hold good for other areas of the United\nNations activities.\nI said at the very outset that the international\ncommunity was at a crossroads in our attempts to build\nan international dispensation in which the threat of mass\ndestruction had no place. The achievements of the last 30\nyears in setting in place treaties, institutions and norms to\nensure that we move in that direction are impressive. But\nthey are not invulnerable. Inadequate verification, non-\ncompliance, aberrant behaviour, budget fatigue, reform\nfatigue failure of political will \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all of these things have\nthe potential to unravel and to undermine what we have\nbuilt together. Effective arms control, disarmament and\nnon-proliferation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d like all the other subjects that are\nbeing addressed from this rostrum \u00e2\u20ac\u201d require large\ninvestments of political and economic capital. It might be\nnatural at times, particularly challenging and worrying\ntimes such as we are currently experiencing, to wonder if\nit is worth the cost. Brief consideration of the alternatives\nis surely enough to convince us that the answer is\nundoubtedly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nTo do otherwise would be to betray not only the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights which we are\ncommemorating, but also the very principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir, let me\nextend to Mr. Opertti the felicitations of my delegation on\nhis unanimous election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. We are confident that\nunder his experienced leadership we will be able to achieve\nsubstantive progress in the deliberations of this Assembly.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a\nwell-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, who presided over one of the most eventful\nsessions of the General Assembly. In particular, I would\nlike to express our gratitude for his skilful stewardship of\nour deliberations on the reform package of the Secretary-\nGeneral, which led to the successful completion of an\nimportant phase in the United Nations reform process.\nLast year the Secretary-General presented us with his\nmost comprehensive and far-reaching proposals for the\nstrengthening and reinvigoration of this Organization. We\nwere also able to adopt two landmark resolutions, 52/12\nA and 52/12 B, during the substantive part of the fifty-\nsecond session to enable us to reform this Organization\nand to introduce new mechanisms, including the Office of\nDeputy Secretary-General, to improve its performance.\nWith these new mechanisms, the Organization has been\nable to renew the emphasis on economic, social and\ndevelopment activities. We are pleased that we have Ms.\nFr\u00e9chette, an outstanding person with vast experience, as\nthe first Deputy Secretary-General of the Organization.\nEarly this year we were able to take further steps to\nmove forward the reform process, a process that is still\ncontinuing. We would like to thank the Secretary-General\nfor his timely submission of reports and additional\nexplanations in response to resolution 52/12 B. We hope\nthat the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General will push\nforward the ongoing process.\nAs a developing nation, we hope that the reform\nprocess will strengthen the ability of the United Nations\nto fulfil its role and functions in the field of development\nand to respond effectively to the development needs of\nthe developing countries. In this respect, the establishment\nof a Development Account under the reform process is a\nwelcome step.\nForward movement in the overall reform of the\nUnited Nations is not matched by similar progress in the\nreform of the Security Council. We are somewhat\ndisheartened over the lack of tangible results on the core\nissues in the deliberations of the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council. I am\nsure that every State Member of this Organization shares\nthe view that the reform of the Security Council is one of\nthe most crucial aspects of the entire United Nations\nreform process. This process will be considered by the\nworld community as seriously inadequate, and much less\ngenuine, if we fail to produce a Security Council that is\ntruly representative of the present membership of this\nOrganization and can effectively respond to future\nchallenges. We do not believe that a body that is not\ndemocratic and representative can really look after the\ninterests of the broad membership in its cardinal task of\nmaintaining international peace and security.\n11\n\n\nWe all have been engaged in in-depth and intensive\ndiscussions of the various aspects of the Security Council\nreform for almost five years now. Although we had had\nhigh hopes that the latest rounds of discussions of the\nWorking Group would produce general agreement on the\nmore contentious issues related to the Security Council, the\ndesired goal remains elusive. We nevertheless are gratified\nto note that the Working Group has made encouraging\nheadway in its deliberations on measures conducive to\nimproving the working methods and transparency of the\nCouncil?s activities. We believe that expansion of the\nSecurity Council in a balanced manner is one of the main\nelements of Security Council reform. We are discouraged\nby the fact that it is on this core element that substantive\ndifferences among the delegations still remain. These\nfundamental differences have proved to be a major obstacle\nto our forward movement towards a general agreement on\na common package.\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we in\ngeneral subscribe to the common position of the Movement\non Security Council reform. However, we wish to make\nsome observations on certain core issues on which we feel\nwe should register our position.\nFirst of all, my delegation wishes to emphasize that\nthe objective of the entire process of Security Council\nreform is not the mere addition of a couple of countries to\nits permanent membership. Although it has been accepted\nin principle that three permanent seats should be allotted to\ndeveloping countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America,\nthe mode of their identification and selection, despite\nvarious suggestions and concepts on the table, seems\nintractable at this juncture and remains unsettled. Myanmar\nwould view with concern any move or measure biased\ntowards particular candidates. Myanmar believes that\ncountries which are capable of contributing to international\npeace and security should be permanent members in the\nexpanded Council. We also favour the expansion of the\nSecurity Council in both permanent and non-permanent\nmemberships.\nWe are now being provided with an historic\nopportunity to devise ways of selecting new permanent\nmembers for the Security Council.\nAlthough there has been noticeably strong support for\nexpansion of the Security Council in its permanent\ncategory, we have not been able to translate various ideas\non this question into a viable formula acceptable to all. In\nthis connection, the idea of rotating new permanent\nmembers, which the Organization of African Unity has\ndecided to apply to the African countries, is a very\nsignificant concept. There appear to be a growing number\nof States attracted to it, and Myanmar is one of those\ncountries. This is a concept submitted by a particular\nregion for itself and not meant for export to other regions.\nNevertheless, we should not rule out the concept as one\nof the possible options applicable to other regions such as\nAsia, in the event that other modalities of selection or\noptions fail to command enough support. It is vitally\nimportant that expansion of the Security Council in both\ncategories of membership take place simultaneously for\nall regions.\nMyanmar is one of the 74 members of the\nOrganization which has never been a member of the\nSecurity Council. However deficient in its present\nstructure and undemocratic in its practice the Security\nCouncil may be, its role in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the contribution made\nby its members are highly appreciated by the Union of\nMyanmar. Myanmar has therefore always given serious\nattention to the annual election of five non-permanent\nmembers of the Security Council.\nAt the same time, to enhance the role of non-\npermanent members, now generally looked upon as\nperipheral, we could seek a solution by improving the\nworking methods of the Security Council.\nInextricably linked to the expansion of the\npermanent membership of the Security Council is the\nveto. Debate on this question has been continuing both\noutside and inside the Organization since before the\nfounding of the United Nations. Nevertheless, little has\nbeen done in the years since then to rectify its injustice.\nGiven the present state of the discussions, the question\npromises to haunt us in the future, regardless of how\nstrongly we may feel about the practice. While a large\nmajority of Member States are demanding its curtailment\nand eventual elimination, permanent members continue to\nbe entrenched in their position that they cannot accept any\ndiminution of their rights and prerogatives, including the\nveto.\nIn the context of extending the veto to new\npermanent members, two main views have emerged. One\nview argues for its extension to new permanent members.\nIn their opinion, the new members will be inferior\nwithout the veto. The other view states that the enjoyment\nof the veto, as now constituted, by the new permanent\nmembers would entail setbacks. Therefore, to limit the\nveto in scope and application for the moment with a view\n12\n\n\nto its eventual abolishment is, in their view, necessary. In\nthis connection, there have been many sensible suggestions\nto curtail the veto?s scope and application. They are very\ninteresting indeed. The most sensible of them, in our view,\nis the idea of curtailing its application to issues that fall\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In fact,\nthe provisions of Chapter VII are the rationale of the\nSecurity Council.\nMyanmar has consistently held the view that the veto\nis unjust and anachronistic and that its ultimate elimination\nis the most logical conclusion. However, we accept that it\nis unrealistic to eliminate the veto at present. We therefore\nconsider it unfair and discriminatory to deny the veto to\nnew permanent members until we can seal the fate of this\nunwanted relic of the past. We strongly feel that new\nmembers should be endowed with the same rights and\nprerogatives now enjoyed by the current permanent\nmembers.\nI have dealt at some length with the United Nations\nreform process. I have done so because the effective\nfunctioning of the United Nations in fulfilling its role and\nobjectives is of critical importance to developing countries\nlike mine. It is here at the United Nations that developing\ncountries have sovereign equality with big and powerful\ncountries. It is here at the United Nations that we have to\nmaintain and safeguard time-bound principles such as\nsettling international disputes by peaceful means; refraining\nin international relations from the threat or use of force\nagainst the territorial integrity or political independence of\nany State; and refraining from intervention in matters which\nare essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.\nThese are principles that are of the utmost importance\nto developing countries like Myanmar so that they can have\nindependence not only in name but also in reality. Only a\nUnited Nations that is genuinely democratic will ensure that\nthese principles are neither diluted nor made flexible to\nserve the domestic political needs of big and powerful\nnations. In the age of a single super-Power, we are\nwitnessing too often attempts to use the United Nations as\na political tool of the big and powerful nations.\nToo often we are seeing the will of the international\ncommunity become synonymous with that of the single\nmost powerful nation or a group of powerful nations. Only\na United Nations that is genuinely representative can look\nafter not only the interest of big and powerful nations but\nalso the interest of the whole United Nations membership,\nincluding the weakest among them. That is why we place\nso much importance on the United Nations reform process.\nWe had high hopes that the end of the cold war\nwould usher in a new international order. We had high\nhopes that resources used for the arms race could be\ndiverted to development activities. We had hoped for\npeace and tranquillity to prevail worldwide. Instead we\nsee instability and conflict in most regions of the\nworld \u2014 the crisis in the Middle East, the tragedy in\nBosnia, in Kosovo, in Angola, in the Sudan and in\nAfghanistan, to cite just a few. In many of these\nsituations, the United Nations had to spend millions and\nmillions of dollars in its peacekeeping efforts. This has\ncaused a serious drain on the resources of the\nOrganization, whose finances were already in dire\ncircumstances mainly because of a single Member that\nhad withheld its contributions for domestic political\nreasons.\nIt would be a truism to say that the United Nations\nand its operations are overstretched. Much of its resources\nhave been diverted from development activities,\nexpenditures that could be put to more useful purposes for\nthe promotion of the economic and social advancement of\nall peoples.\nIn spite of this situation, there are those who would\nlike to use the United Nations to interfere in matters\nwhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of\nMyanmar. The present Government assumed State\nresponsibility to restore stability and normalcy to the\ncountry when it was in a state of chaos and anarchy. In\nthe last few years the Government has restored stability\nto the country. The insurgency, which has burdened the\ncountry for the last 50 years, is now almost a thing of the\npast. Peace and tranquillity prevail throughout nearly the\nwhole country. These are hard-earned achievements,\nespecially for a multi-ethnic nation such as Myanmar.\nWe have attained stability in Myanmar through our\nown endeavours. We have not imposed any burden on the\ninternational community. We are therefore very much\ndistressed that there are those who would like to use the\nUnited Nations to intervene in matters that are essentially\nwithin our domestic jurisdiction. It was the General\nAssembly itself which adopted numerous resolutions,\nincluding the resolution on the Charter of Economic\nRights and Duties of States, which reaffirms the sovereign\nand inalienable right of each and every State to choose its\neconomic and political systems. We in Myanmar have\nchosen the path of democracy.\nIt is also an irony that at a time when Myanmar has\nopenly and repeatedly declared that it is now in the\n13\n\n\nprocess of building a genuine democratic State with a\nmarket-oriented economic system, political pressure has\nbeen put on us by those who not only would like us to\nadopt democracy but would also like to transplant a\ndemocracy according to their own mould. It is unfortunate\nthat these proponents of a particular type of democracy\nwould like to use the United Nations to interfere in our\ndomestic political process. We in Myanmar strongly believe\nthat the path we have chosen is the right one and is the\nmost suitable to our tradition, to our culture, to our national\nethos and, most importantly, to the aspirations of our\npeople. We shall resolutely continue our endeavours to\nbuild a modern, democratic, peaceful and prosperous nation\nin Myanmar.\nNevertheless, there are some who entertain concerns\nthat difficulties relating to human rights practices in one\ncountry could create economic problems in another. In fact,\nsuch transborder human movements occurred among\nneighbouring countries in the past for various reasons. The\nimportant aspect is that there must be the will to resolve\nand overcome such difficulties through mutual\nunderstanding and respect. The idea of relying on others to\nresolve our own domestic problems should be discouraged.\nWe still live in an unsettled post-cold-war period\nwhere pockets of rising tensions still exist. We are also\nconfronted with a vast array of major problems awaiting\nsolutions. Since we last met, we have witnessed\ndevelopments that give cause for hope as well as for deep\nconcern. As the only multilateral forum to deal with the\nproblems of peace and development, the enhanced role of\nthe United Nations is now more necessary than ever. We all\nhave trust in the Organization?s capability to avert\ncatastrophes of all kinds and to find global solutions to the\nmajor problems of the world. We also have trust in our\ncapacity to work together. It is imperative to redouble our\nconcerted efforts if we are to be successful in the creation\nof a peaceful and prosperous world order. In this common\ntask, Myanmar pledges, as a responsible Member of the\nUnited Nations, to continue its strong support for the\nendeavours of the Organization to promote the economic\nand social advancement of mankind and reaffirms its\ncommitments to the purposes and principles of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, on behalf of the people of Togo and\nPresident Eyadema and his Government, to join in the\ncongratulations extended to you, Sir, since the beginning of\nour work on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-third session.\nWe would also like to congratulate his your illustrious\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on the effective\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second\nsession.\nI would furthermore like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his colleagues for\ntheir continuous efforts to champion the noble ideals of\npeace, justice, progress and solidarity embodied by the\nUnited Nations.\nBy way of analysing the situation in Africa, I would\nlike to present Togo?s perspective of the world?s problems\nin the context of improved international cooperation.\nAfrica is democratizing, but it needs peace and\nsecurity if it is to succeed. Africa is the continent most\naffected by the great scourges of the planet, but its\ndevelopment is also part of a dynamic of progress. The\nscourges hampering its development are well known:\nendemic disease, drought, poverty, political instability,\nethnic conflicts, civil wars and regional conflicts. These\nscourges have a tendency to eclipse the successes.\nSince the signing of the Abuja Treaty in 1991, Africa\nhas set itself a timetable for integration in the framework of\nthe African Economic Community, on the basis of\nstrengthening regional groupings of western, northern,\ncentral, eastern and southern Africa. These groups are\nthemselves actively engaged in seeking joint solutions to\nthe challenges confronting its member States.\nThe rate of economic growth of certain African States\ncontinues to make progress thanks to good management\npolicies.\nA vast democratic movement has begun throughout\nour continent to build States based on the rule of law.\nThis movement is being followed up by the adoption of\nnew constitutions and the establishment of independent\nbodies to implement them. Numerous heads of State and\nof Government have had their mandates challenged in\nperiodic elections. The majority and the opposition\nrepresentatives of the people have seats in the new\nrepresentative bodies \u2014 parliaments and national\nassemblies. The success of the functioning of these new\nconstitutional bodies is ensured by independent legal\nbodies. The press is now free, as are labour unions in\nmost of our States.\nI am emphasizing these institutional aspects of\nbuilding a new Africa because the respect and support of\nthe international community for these institutions is a\nfactor in favour of peace within the particular States, and\ntherefore for peace in our regions.\nExperience has shown us that a domestic conflict, by\ngiving rise to an exodus of people to neighbouring\ncountries, also has a rapid and serious effect on the latter.\nI repeat, as the current situation in the Great Lakes region\ndemonstrates, such domestic conflicts can lead to regional\ncrises.\nTogo is among the States that voluntarily established\ninstitutions that safeguard the rule of law and that can\narbitrate disputes that may arise in the new context of\ndemocratization. It is in this framework that the\nConstitutional Court of Togo declared the results of the\npresidential election of 21 June 1998 after having\narbitrated the disputes that resulted from the election.\nTogo?s respect for institutions is the very foundation\nof democracy and peace. On behalf of my Government,\nI would like to invite all of our partners at the United\nNations to support without distinction the efforts of all the\ncountries of Africa that commit themselves to the difficult\nbut rewarding path of building a State of law. This is the\nprice of peace in Africa.\nWhile we can be gratified at the end of certain\nconflicts \u2014 particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2014\nand while solutions are in sight to relieve the tensions in\nGuinea-Bissau, we cannot fail to express our concern over\nthe crisis in the Great Lakes region, the resumption of\nhostilities in Angola, the continuation of the crisis in\nSomalia and, finally, the armed confrontation between\nEthiopia and Eritrea.\n7\n\n\nWe cannot stress enough the advantages of dialogue\nand negotiation as the best paths to follow for settling\ndisputes between States on the basis of respect for their\nterritorial integrity.\nIn that connection, the international community must\nput an end to the embargo imposed on Libya by\nimplementing the jurisdictional solution accepted by that\ncountry and by ensuring a fair trial for the suspects in the\nLockerbie bombing. Togo firmly supports the efforts of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to settle this dispute\nand end the suffering of the Libyan people.\nMy country takes this opportunity to repeat its\nsteadfast condemnation of terrorism in all of its forms and\nto emphasize the need for urgent and concerted action to\ncombat this scourge effectively.\nAs we are aware, the proliferation of conflict\nsituations in Africa remains a real cause of concern for the\ninternational community. I would like to note in this regard\nthe important report (A/52/871) presented by the Secretary-\nGeneral last February at the request of the Security Council\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\npeace and sustainable development in Africa. That report\ncontains specific recommendations on means of preventing\nsuch conflicts and putting an end to them, as well as on\nmeasures to be taken to create conditions for lasting peace\nand economic growth. We hope that the implementation of\nhis recommendations by the Security Council, by the\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations system and by the\nBretton Woods institutions will result in the effective\nprevention of conflicts and put Africa on the road to\nprogress, stability and sustainable development.\nElsewhere in the world, we were relieved to see the\nsigning of an agreement between the Government of Iraq\nand the United Nations, which made it possible at the last\nmoment to avoid a new confrontation in the Gulf.\nIn the same region, my Government deplores the\npresent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\nWe remain convinced that only the resumption of direct\nnegotiations between the principals will make it possible to\nusher in an era of peace, security and prosperity in that\nregion. We were relieved to see the contacts that have taken\nplace between Mr. Yasser Arafat and Mr. Benjamin\nNetanyahu through the mediation of the American\nGovernment. Togo strongly supports this initiative.\nWith regard to the other crises that assail the world\nand jeopardize the lives of so many millions of people \u2014\nparticularly in Afghanistan and Kosovo \u2014 my country\nhopes that through firm political will backed by candid\nand sincere negotiations, the parties to the conflicts will\nfind appropriate solutions that are acceptable to all.\nThe world?s concerns at the dawn of the third\nmillennium are not linked solely to the effects of the\nphenomenon of globalization. The preservation of peace,\nsecurity and stability for States and peoples continues to\nbe an important priority. In that context, Togo is gratified\nto note that the United Nations is continuing to discharge\nits mission of peacemaking and peacekeeping. In this\nregard, I welcome the upcoming commemoration on 6\nOctober of 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations, and I would like to pay tribute to the memory\nof all the men and women who have given their lives in\nthe service of the Organization.\nMy country, which firmly supports the ongoing quest\nfor peace and security for all, would like to emphasize the\nneed to strengthen cooperation in this area, in a spirit of\ncomplementarity, between the United Nations and\nsubregional and regional organizations, in accordance with\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. The\nappropriate regional machinery necessary to give concrete\nform to this shared desire for collective maintenance of\npeace and security should be established.\nIt is in that spirit that Togo \u2014 together with other\ncountries of the West African subregion and in the\nframework of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) \u2014 is working to establish a viable and\npermanent mechanism for the prevention, management\nand settlement of conflicts and the maintenance of peace.\nIt is also within this framework that we welcome the\nfourth extraordinary summit of ECOWAS, held in Lom\u00e9\nfrom 16 to 17 December 1997, and the holding of the\njoint military manoeuvres named \u201cCohesion Kompienga\n?98\u201d, held from 16 to 21 April 1998, in which the armed\nforces of Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d?Ivoire, Ghana, the\nNiger, Nigeria, Chad and Togo participated.\nAmong the goals of the United Nations are vigilance\nover the maintenance of peace and security, the\nestablishment of conditions for harmonious economic\ndevelopment to ensure the well-being of our populations\nand working for a just world in which the rights of\nindividuals and peoples are not only recognized and\nconsecrated, but above all respected.\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to\nhail the holding of the United Nation Diplomatic\n8\n\n\nConference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court, which led to the adoption of\nthe Statute of the court which was held in Rome from\n15 June to 17 July.\nTogo believes that peace is impossible without justice.\nThe struggle for peace and the struggle for greater justice\nmust be viewed as two complementary aspects of one and\nthe same struggle for the realization of the deepest\naspirations of all the peoples of the world. The positive\noutcome of the negotiations at the Conference resulted in\nthe adoption of the Statute of the court, illustrating anew\nthe vigour and ability of our Organization in dealing with\nthe present and preparing States to face the issues of\ntomorrow.\nIt is for that reason that my delegation favours all\nefforts to reform the Organization that aim to make it more\neffective, more concerned with the problems of mankind\nand more democratic, so that the views of all are better\nreflected and taken into account in all of its bodies.\nTogo would therefore like to see the rapid conclusion\nof discussions to allow for the permanent representation of\nAfrica in the Security Council, in accordance with the\nresolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\nThe democracy we are advocating at the national level must\nalso be reflected in international organizations.\nThe United Nations has always played an important\nrole in the advancement of economic and social\ndevelopment and, when necessary, in providing the men,\nwomen and children of the entire world with the assistance\non which their survival often depends. We are nevertheless\nobliged to recognize that despite the efforts made, the\nimprovement of standards of living, full employment and\nthe conditions for progress and economic and social\ndevelopment have not been realized. This is particularly the\ncase in Africa, where continued inequality and poverty,\namong other things, dangerously imperil the stability of\nStates.\nIt is true that African economies have performed\nremarkably well in the last three years; but it is also true\nthat the consolidation of these gains still depends on the\ninternational economic environment. Global economic\nstructural constraints \u2014 including the continuing burden of\ndebt, the reduction in the flow of official development\nassistance, currency fluctuations, the inequality of\ninvestment flows, weak commodity prices and market\nprotectionism practised by developed countries \u2014 still\nremain the major obstacles to the economic development\nof African countries.\nWith regard to the debt burden in particular, my\ncountry highly values the declaration of the eighth\nconsultative meeting of the Organization of African Unity,\nthe African Development Bank and the Economic\nCommission for Africa, which was held in Abidjan in\nJanuary 1998. We believe that the efforts to alleviate the\ndebt burden must be continued in conjunction with\nAfrica?s partners in order to find appropriate solutions to\nthis thorny problem.\nIn this context, Togo would like to reaffirm the\nimperative need to hold an international conference on\nAfrica?s foreign debt, and it requests the support of the\ninternational community to translate that proposal into\nreality.\nRegrettably, at this time of economic globalization,\nthe marginalization of Africa in terms of international\ntrade is accelerating, even though today the development\nof trade appears to be the most effective means of\nmanaging the resources necessary for self-sufficiency.\nIndeed, the development and economic growth of African\nStates requires as a basic condition sufficient currency\ninflows from the export of their commodities. Thus, in the\nview of my delegation, an open world system operating\nunder just and equitable regulations should be established\nin order to ensure the active participation of African\nStates in international trade. To that end, more liberal\nmeasures will be required in order to promote the\ntransformation and diversification of their products as\nwell as to attract and channel investments towards them.\nThe industrialized countries are attempting to join\nforces. This shows clearly that today no country,\nregardless of how powerful it is, can alone provide for its\nown economic growth and cope with increasingly\naggressive international competition. Given this state of\naffairs, the African countries have in recent years\nreaffirmed their will to pool their potential by establishing\nand strengthening subregional units. It is clear that the\ndevelopment policy of our countries must be considered\nwithin this framework, for this is the only way that Africa\ncan become a fully fledged and reliable partner in the\nworld of the twenty-first century.\nIn this respect, the entry into force of the Treaty\nestablishing the African Economic Community serves as\na good illustration of the will of African States to unite\ntheir efforts to ensure their own progress.\n9\n\n\nTogo, which is firmly committed to the policy of\neconomic integration of the continent, wishes to take this\nopportunity to once again urge the international community\nto support the efforts of the African countries to achieve the\ngoals of sustainable development which alone can promote\nprosperity and the well-being of their peoples.\nI should like here to underscore an emerging trend in\nAfrica: inter-African parliamentary control of the activities\nof our regional and subregional organizations. It is in this\nframework that an inter-parliamentary committee of the\nWest African Economic and Monetary Union was created\nrecently in Bamako; its work is already under way. Also in\nthis framework, a parliamentary assembly was established\nin the countries of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC), in southern Africa. This shows that\nwhile, generally speaking, people tend to despair of the\nfuture of Africa, we young Africans have faith that Africa\nis on the right path as long as we have the unswerving\nsupport of the international community.\nHere I should like once again to welcome the\ncommitment of the Japanese Government to Africa through\nthe Tokyo Conference on the Development of Africa\n(TICAD), aimed at seeking solutions to the continent?s\ndevelopment problems. My delegation would like here once\nagain to thank the Japanese Government for all of its\nefforts to strengthen cooperation between Africa and Asia,\nand congratulates it on the convening of TICAD II next\nOctober in Tokyo.\nMoreover, Togo believes that the combination of\nTICAD with other initiatives \u2014 in particular that of the\nUnited States on equitable partnership, known as 20/20\nVision; that of the European Union, within the framework\nof the Lom\u00e9 Convention; and that of the francophone\nworld, within the framework of the Hanoi Plan of\nAction \u2014 will help safeguard and consolidate the spirit of\nsolidarity, which Africa wishes to see ever more active and\never more purposeful.\nMy country is convinced of the need for solidarity\namong the Members of our Organization and is deeply\ncommitted to the noble ideals of peace, freedom and justice\nand of economic, social and cultural progress, which the\nUnited Nations has contributed to advancing. During this\nyear of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, Togo fervently hopes to witness the\nrealization, for the benefit of all humankind, of the\nprofound aspirations of peoples to greater freedom and to\na world of peace in which the struggle against poverty,\nfamine and illness grows is daily strengthened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me to offer, on\nbehalf of President Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the\nGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone, our warm\nfelicitations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession, and to express our delegation?s confidence that\nunder his able guidance our session will be a successful\none. We are in no doubt that his distinguished public record\nadequately equips him for the position he has been called\nupon to assume, and we have already seen evidence of this\nin the last two weeks. We must also express gratitude to his\npredecessor, Mr. Udovenko of Ukraine, for a job well done.\nOur gratitude also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-\nGeneral, and to the entire staff of the United Nations\ncommon system for their relentless efforts in helping the\npeople of Sierra Leone in the mammoth task of\nreconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement of hundreds\nof thousands of our compatriots who were the unfortunate\nvictims of nine months of junta misrule. Mr. Annan has\nput the international ship of state on the right course, and\nmy delegation wishes him continued success.\nThis time last year, my President addressed the\nAssembly on the subject of the situation in Sierra Leone.\nI am sure most members will remember the picture he\npainted of the tragic events and the turmoil that followed\nwhen a democratically elected Government was\noverthrown by a bunch of military adventurists, aided and\nabetted by some civilian opportunists who became their\nactive collaborators. Thanks to the resilience of the whole\nof civil society, encouraged and backed by the\ninternational community, I am here today representing the\nlegitimate, reinstated Government of Sierra Leone.\nAgainst all odds, our people defied the violent and\nmisguided gun-toting anarchists who appeared to have\none objective, and one only: the total destruction of the\ncivil society of Sierra Leone. Mercifully, that nightmare\nis now behind us.\nIn February this year, the forces of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG), under the then ECOWAS\nChairman, the late General Sani Abacha of Nigeria, led\nby Nigeria and with the support of our Civil Defence\nUnit, removed the junta. This was preceded by several\nattempts to arrive at a negotiated settlement. The\ninternational community was to learn that the junta and\ntheir allies, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), always\nnegotiated in bad faith and were not to be trusted.\nThe atrocities committed by the junta during their\nnine-month reign, especially after they retreated to the\neastern and northern parts of the country, had to be seen\nto be believed. Rape, murder, mutilation, vandalism and\nthe burning down of whole villages were the order of the\nday. Unarmed civilians, particularly women and children,\nwere their unfortunate victims.\nBecause of the wanton destruction perpetrated by the\njunta and, much earlier, by the RUF, there is a great need\nto revamp the economy and for reconstruction. In a report\nto the General Assembly, the Secretary-General referred\nto the Special Conference on Sierra Leone, which he\nconvened here at United Nations Headquarters on 30 July\nthis year. The international community was invited to\nfocus on the situation in Sierra Leone.\n21\n\n\nWe were very much encouraged, not only by the\ndeliberations and results of that conference, but also by the\ndeliberations of the second ministerial-level Security\nCouncil meeting on Africa, held last week, in which Sierra\nLeone featured prominently.\nThe humanitarian crisis is immense: there are many\nrefugees and displaced persons. The disarmament and\ndemobilization exercise and the resettlement, rehabilitation\nand reconstruction processes require many resources. Some\nof the pledges that were made are now being fulfilled, but\nmuch remains to be done.\nAllow me to echo the appeal of the Secretary-General\nto those who have yet to pledge, and to others who have\nyet to deliver, to do all they can to help us. In the\nmeantime, I would like to express profound gratitude to all\nmembers, and especially to the members of the contact\ngroup to be coordinated by the United Kingdom, for what\nhas been achieved so far.\nAs soon as the legitimate Government was\noverthrown, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), at\nits meeting in Harare in June 1997, unanimously\ncondemned the takeover and called on the junta to return\npower and constitutionality to the elected Government and\nto the country respectively. The prompt action of\nECOWAS, the resultant peace in Liberia and now the\nreturn of democracy to Sierra Leone, clearly demonstrate\nwhat a regional organization can achieve if the\ndetermination and the leadership are there. ECOMOG has\nthe capacity to deliver, but it needs the tools, which only\nthe international community can provide.\nMy country is fully aware that even though the Armed\nForces Revolutionary Council (AFRC)/RUF junta has been\nousted, the peace and security that were achieved with\nenormous sacrifice by the people of Sierra Leone have yet\nto be consolidated. It is therefore in the interests of the\npeople that the international community in general and the\nforces of the subregion in particular, maintain their presence\nin Sierra Leone until we can create a new national army. In\nthis regard, the Federal Republic of Nigeria has agreed to\nthe secondment of Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe,\nCommander of the ECOMOG Force in Sierra Leone, as our\nChief of Defence Staff. He is already working on the\nmodalities for forming a well-trained and dedicated army\nwhich will be alive to its responsibility as defender of our\nConstitution. I have every reason to believe that that\nassignment will be carried out with the same\nprofessionalism that has been the hallmark of ECOMOG\noperations in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nAt this juncture, I would like to state that the\nGovernment of the Republic of Sierra Leone is committed\nto the demobilization, disarmament and integration of all\nex-combatants, as provided for in both the Abidjan Peace\nAccord and the Conakry peace plan, despite the lack of\ngood faith that has been demonstrated by both the RUF\nand the junta. This programme is at the top of our post-\nconflict agenda, and the Disarmament Committee itself is\nunder the chairmanship of no less a person than our\nPresident.\nBecause of its overwhelming desire to uphold the\nprinciples of democracy and good governance, the\nGovernment lays much emphasis on the rule of law,\nhuman rights and freedom of expression. There are over\n48 newspaper publications in a country with 80 per cent\nilliteracy. Despite propaganda to the contrary, no\njournalists have been prosecuted, let alone convicted, for\npractising their profession \u2014 not even when the headlines\nof a few have sometimes bordered on libel. Of the 16\npeople recently convicted of treason, after a trial that was\ndeclared transparent and fair, five were journalists; but\nthey were not charged for the practice of journalism.\nPresident Kabbah and the ECOMOG Force\nCommander informed the Special Conference on Sierra\nLeone that more than 90 per cent of the country was\nsecure and safe. Remnants of the junta and the RUF are,\nhowever, perched in small areas in the east and north-east\nand operate only because they continue to have a safe\nhaven in a neighbouring country, while one other country\nrenders its support to them from outside Sierra Leone.\nThat notwithstanding, every effort is now being made by\nboth ECOMOG and the Civil Defence Unit to flush them\nout and to finally put this whole tragic affair behind us.\nThe treason trials of both civilians and former junta\nmembers are still in progress, under laws which have\nbeen in existence since independence. Soon after sentence\nwas passed on the first group, some misguided\norganizations began unfairly pressurizing the President to\nintervene; they even mounted a vicious propaganda\ncampaign in the name of human rights.\nMy country is governed by the rule of law. Under\nour constitution there is separation of powers between the\nexecutive, the legislature and the judiciary. While the due\nprocess of law is in progress, the President cannot and\nwill not interfere with it. At the end of the exercise those\nwho lose their final appeals to the Supreme Court can\napply to the Prerogative of Mercy Committee. Then, and\n22\n\n\nonly then, will the President step in, and he has already\ngiven that assurance.\nOur President has not only gone the extra mile, but is\nseen to be bending over backwards to bring together all the\nmain political groups into the mainstream of the post-\nconflict nation-building exercise, so as to secure permanent\npeace and security. There have been no instances of human\nrights violations since President Kabbah assumed office.\nWith regard to the armed rebellion in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and the rebel wars in Angola, Sudan\nand elsewhere, we appeal to the parties in those conflicts to\nlay down their arms, to refrain from further provocative\nactivities that ignite tempers and to give peace a chance.\nOur Government welcomes the successful outcome of\nthe United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, which\ntook place in Rome, Italy, in June 1998. Sierra Leone is\nfirmly committed to the early establishment of a permanent\ninternational court, and my Government has already signed\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. We urge\nevery nation to sign and ratify the Statute. It will be not\nonly testimony to the common desire to overcome long\nneglected failures of national legal systems, but a unique\nchance to contribute to international stability deterrence\nand, hopefully, the prevention of atrocious crimes.\nSecurity Council reform is one of the most difficult\nissues which have to be tackled during this session. While\nprogress has been made in some areas, and new ideas and\nproposals have emerged, the Working Group has not\npresented recommendations to the General Assembly. Sierra\nLeone agrees with the position of the Non-Aligned\nMovement on the curtailment, limitation and subsequent\nelimination of the veto. Sierra Leone fully endorses the\ndecision of the Assembly of the Heads of State or\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity for two\npermanent seats to be allocated to our continent.\nAs for the expansion of the Security Council, Sierra\nLeone supports the position taken by the Non-Aligned\nMovement, that, in order to enhance its credibility, the new\nCouncil should reflect the universal character of the world\nand correct existing imbalances in its composition.\nMy country cannot talk of conflicts and peace without\nreferring to nuclear arms. When negotiations were being\nconducted in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a\nfew years ago, the Republic of Sierra Leone was one of\nthose countries which prayed silently for its success. We\nare relieved and thankful that the Treaty has been signed\nby a large number of countries. We continue to call on all\nnations to sign the test-ban treaty and refrain from further\ntests, with their attendant danger to the future of mankind.\nIn the same way as we oppose all future nuclear\ntests, we must with all the emphasis at our disposal\ncondemn all forms of terrorism, both domestic and\ninternational. We refer particularly to the recent bombings\nwhich claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent people,\nnot to mention the loss of property worth millions of\ndollars in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam, Cape Town and\nNorthern Ireland. We call on the international community\nto coordinate its efforts to fight this menace. Those who\ninsist on using this method to achieve their aims should\nbe tracked down and brought to justice. In this regard, my\ncountry wholeheartedly supports the signing and\nratification of all the Conventions on terrorism and\nappeals to the entire international community to adhere to\nthe Conventions in order to make the world a safer place\nfor our children?s children.\nMy Government noted with great delight the\nconference convened last year in South Africa to focus\nthe world?s attention on the dangers posed to human life\nby landmines. We revive the memory of the late Princess\nDiana, who did so much to focus the attention of the\ninternational community on the horrors of landmines. In\nour own country, too, landmines were strewn around with\ncarefree abandon by the AFRC/RUF junta, resulting in\nthe maiming and death of innocent civilians, especially\nchildren.\nMany African and other third world countries,\nincluding my own, are today still grappling with severe\neconomic problems. The effects of the debt burden, the\nunfavourable balances of trade and payment, and the\nunpredictability of the prices of their products on the\nworld market have all contributed to the deteriorating\neconomic conditions they are facing. In addition to these\nexternal factors, misguided policies and political\ninstability caused by various kinds of civil strife have\ncaused their economies to sink further. Globalization and\ntrade liberalization have become inevitable phases in\nworld trade. It has, however, become obvious that our\ncountries have fared badly and will continue to be at a\ndisadvantage unless there is a change of attitude and even\nprocedure on the part of developed, industrialized\ncountries. The resultant imbalances can be overcome if\nevery effort is made to create a level playing field by\nremoving the debt burden of our countries and opening up\nmarkets to African and third world products. Some\n23\n\n\ncountries have already done so; we hope that others will\nfollow soon.\nI have already mentioned the refugee situation in my\nown country. It is grim, and yet the situation is the same in\nother parts of the world, especially Africa, which has the\nlargest refugee populations. This situation has continued to\nexert tremendous pressure on the already weak economies\nof the host countries, which are forced to spend part of\ntheir meagre resources on the welfare of refugees. Having\ngone through this experience both as recipient and exporter\nof refugees, we must commend the donor community and\nespecially the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Much is being done\nfor us, but even the Office acknowledges that the situation\nof our refugees in neighbouring countries is desperate. I\nwould like to appeal to the donor community to shed its\ndonor fatigue syndrome and continue to respond positively\nto the needs of a people who are the innocent victims of\nevents not of their own making. A very urgent need now is\nfor the repatriation of our people from neighbouring\ncountries, where life in camps is now a nightmare.\nSierra Leone is one of the countries in our subregion\nthat still have the remnants of what were once the Upper\nGuinea rain forest, which stretches from Sierra Leone down\nto the Cameroons. The reserve supports the largest number\nof animal species in Sierra Leone: a total of 46 mammal\nspecies, including Western chimpanzees, red colobus\nmonkeys, Diana monkeys, duickers, leopards and forest\nelephants. Two hundred and seventy four species of birds\nare to be found in the Gola rain forest. These include 10\nglobally threatened species \u2014 8 restricted to the Upper\nGuinea forest block \u2014 and 169 forest-dependent species.\nThere is a very rich diversity of interesting invertebrates,\nincluding two species of dragonfly, endemic only to parts\nof the Upper Guinea forest, as well as the rare African\nswallow-tailed butterfly, which has Sierra Leone as the\nwesternmost limit of its range in Africa.\nUnfortunately, the Gola rain forest, like most other\nforest areas on the continent, is under considerable pressure.\nMuch of the forest cover is lost annually from logging and\nfrom brush burning as well as shifting cultivation carried\nout by an ever-increasing population. Conservation of these\nforests in Sierra Leone, as in other parts of Africa, is linked\nwith poverty. The Forestry Division of our Ministry of\nAgriculture and the Environment has a Gola Rain Forest\nConservation Programme. The programme is being operated\nin collaboration with a local non-governmental organization,\nthe Conservation Society of Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone\npartner of Birdlife International, which sponsors the\nprogramme.\nNotwithstanding this valuable work, pressure on\nforests in the third world will not be reduced unless we\nenhance food production from the same piece of land year\nafter year, as happens in the industrialized countries. This\ncan only be achieved by a transfer of food production\ntechnology to our own countries.\nI have made frequent references to the role of the\ninternational community in the restoration of democracy\nto my country and to the reinstatement of President\nKabbah. I have mentioned the United Nations, the OAU,\nECOWAS and the Commonwealth. I would like to make\nspecial reference to the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP).\nThe restoration of constitutional order and the\nvarious efforts of the Government to effect durable peace\nand to rebuild the country provide us with an opportunity\nto regain donor confidence and ensure the completion of\nvarious initiatives and programmes interrupted by the\nevents of the coup of 25 May 1997.\nAs lead agency in the partnership between the\nGovernment and the donor community, the UNDP, prior\nto the coup, had spearheaded the following: preparation\nof a national poverty-eradication programme; facilitating\nthe establishment of a coordination mechanism for relief\nassistance by the humanitarian community; and\nfacilitating the peace process through the provision of\ndiplomatic, logistic, technical and administrative support\nto the peace negotiations and the preparation of the\ndemobilization programme. Since the return of the elected\nGovernment in March 1998, the UNDP has spent\nconsiderable amounts of money in the development of\nvarious other programmes as well. I urge the international\ncommunity to continue its support for these programmes\nand to help us in our task of rehabilitation.\nLet me close by referring again to the report of the\nSecretary-General, whom I have already thanked. I shall\nrefer once more to the special conference he convened,\nfor which I thank the Secretary-General.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Opertti on\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. I would also like to commend the\nefforts of his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nwhom we recently welcomed to our country.\nI should also like to place on record our appreciation\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. He has been\nworking tirelessly to promote the authority of the United\nNations, advocating respect for the international\nlegitimacy for which it stands, especially in the area of\nfinding peaceful solutions to the explosive conflicts that\nare raging in some parts of the world. The international\ncommunity has recognized his great achievement when he\nsucceeded a few months ago in defusing an ominous\nmilitary confrontation in the Arab Gulf region. We hope\nthat this will be followed by similar successes in other\nvolatile situations plaguing different parts of the world.\nThe hopes that are pinned on the United Nations\nassume a special meaning at this session, which coincides\nwith the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, an instrument which Lebanon\nparticipated in framing. Today, human rights are a major\npillar of the new world order. Respect for human rights\nhas become the yardstick by which the democracy\npractised in countries is judged. Compliance with the\nprovisions of the Declaration under all circumstances and\nconditions guarantees not only the peace, security and\nstability of societies but also the establishment of relations\nof cooperation and understanding among States.\nThe United Nations is duty-bound to enhance its\nindependence since it was liberated from the impact of\nthe cold war and of the bipolarity which held sway over\ninternational relations in the post-Second World War era.\nToday, it is called upon to reactivate its role in making\nand consolidating peace. This task can be achieved\nprimarily by addressing the root causes of conflicts,\nthrough preventive diplomacy and through various\n18\n\n\ntechnical and development assistance programmes in\nvarious fields.\nIt is important here to refer to the fact that\ninternational institutions have an important role to play in\nproviding the developing countries with the necessary\ntechnical assistance. Such assistance will enable them to\ntake advantage of the accelerated pace of globalization in\nthe field of trade and finance. It will also give these\ncountries sufficient time to adapt and get ready to face the\nnew challenges. This will help many developing countries\navoid the negative effects of surging globalization, given\nthe inadequacy of their production capabilities and the\nabsence of a competitive edge. In this regard, Lebanon is\neffectively contributing to the establishment of a free trade\nzone specifically in the Arab region while continuing its\ncommitment to the establishment of trade liberalization\nworldwide.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, the United\nNations role requires it to fulfil the tasks of reform and\nstreamlining so that it can keep up with the fast pace of\ninternational relations. Thus the reform measures initiated\nby the Secretary-General must be completed. Furthermore,\nthe reform of the working methods and streamlining of the\nSecurity Council to increase its membership and make it\nmore representative should also be completed. Once\nreformed, different States, particularly small States, will be\nenabled to participate in the decision-making process\nrelevant to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nWe commend the efforts that went into the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court whose\nStatute was recently adopted in Rome. Lebanon supports\nthe establishment of the Court and is determined to study\nits Statute positively.\nMore than ever before, the international community is\ncalled upon to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nespecially in extremely sensitive regions of the world. We\nneed also to address the root causes of the problems and\nthereby to defuse the crises before they turn into full-scale\nconflagrations.\nThe time has come to solve pending problems,\nparticularly those of the Middle East region. For instance,\na settlement must be found to the question of the three\nislands in the Gulf disputed by the United Arab Emirates\nand Iran. Such a settlement should restore the disputed\nislands to their rightful owners and thus promote peace and\nstability among the States and the peoples of the region.\nIf we are truly interested in the promotion of\nregional and international peace and security, we must\nwork in all seriousness to build a world free from\nweapons of mass destruction. In this context, we aspire\nand call for the establishment of a zone free from nuclear\nand other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle\nEast.\nFive years ago, I was privileged to stand here before\nthe General Assembly to speak about Lebanon and about\nits commitment to a just and comprehensive peace. From\nthis very rostrum, I declared that Lebanon is committed\nto the principles of democracy, liberty and human rights,\nand that it has succeeded in safeguarding these principles\neven through its darkest moments.\nIn this context, reference should be made to\nLebanon?s firm position of condemning terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations including political, cultural and\neconomic. We condemn terrorism whether sponsored by\nStates or by individuals. Lebanon condemns attacks\nagainst civilians, embassies and diplomatic missions,\nplane hijacking and any other act that jeopardizes the\nlives and property of civilians. However, we must stress\nthe importance of distinguishing between terrorism and\npeoples? rights to resist the forces of foreign occupation\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and\nin its successive resolutions adopted by the international\nOrganization and other fora, especially the Declaration of\nthe Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\nNations.\nLebanon is fully committed to the role of the United\nNations and is keen on furthering this role and on\nsafeguarding the equilibrium and integrity of international\nrelations. We therefore believe that it is important for all\nStates, large and small, to commit to the principles of\ninternational legitimacy and refrain from undertaking\nunilateral measures that are driven solely by narrow\ninterests and dictated by expediency.\nToday, as we reiterate these constant positions of\nprinciple, we can point with confidence to the originality\nof our experience in coexistence, which is based on\nmoderation and tolerance, and our firm belief in both\ndeserves to be a living model that should be emulated\nwhenever solutions are sought to the problems of societies\nafflicted with wars, racial or factional strife all over the\nworld. This is particularly true of societies that are trying\nto restore civil peace as part of their post-conflict peace-\nbuilding efforts.\n19\n\n\nLebanon, with an open and creative society, a society\nthat is Arab by identity and orientation, has remained united\nin territory, population and institutions; Lebanon has\nremained a vibrant oasis of goodwill and beneficial\ninteraction.\nAs is well known, Lebanon has for the past few years\nembarked on a reconstruction plan following a protracted\ndevastating war. It has been tirelessly working to regain the\nprominent cultural and economic position it once held in its\nregion and in the world, depending on God Almighty, then\non the will and resourcefulness of its own citizens and on\nthe support of its brothers and the contributions of its\nfriends all over the world.\nThroughout this period of reconstruction, Lebanon\nfaced difficult circumstances caused first and foremost by\nthe continued Israeli occupation of parts of its territories\nand by the continuity of its devastating attacks against its\nvillages and peaceful citizens. These attacks have claimed\nthe lives of many innocent civilians, men, women and\nchildren, and wounded many many more. I am confident\nthat the international community still remembers very well\nthe Qana massacre perpetrated by Israel in 1996.\nLebanon has faced a critical stage of its history\nthrough the past few years while implementing the\nreconstruction plans. The only parallel to the intensity of\nthis stage is the determination of the Lebanese people to\nface the various challenges on more than one front.\nLebanon has succeeded in regaining the world?s confidence\nin its ability to play once more a distinguished and shining\nrole in the cultural, economic, commercial and financial\nfields. Beirut is back to its position as the crossroads of\nvarious cultures and civilizations, a fact attested to by the\nmany conferences and the regional and international\nmeetings that were convened there. The United Nations\nbuilding that Lebanon has recently completed as the focal\npoint for United Nations activities in Lebanon and in the\nregion is proof, if any was needed, of Lebanon?s keen\ninterest in the return of international organizations to Beirut.\nAs an indication of international confidence in our\nperformance, the world financial markets traded in treasury\nbonds issued by the Lebanese Government and institutions\nof the private sector. This was made possible by the\ncooperation between the Lebanese financial institutions and\ntheir international counterparts. It is a demonstration of the\nconfidence that the world has in the present and future of\nthe national economy and of the confidence of the Lebanese\nthemselves in their country and its future.\nBut to date, Israel has not wanted to meet its\ncommitments; it has not done what it promised to the\nPalestinians and to the international community; it does\nnot want to resume the negotiations with Lebanon and\nwith Syria from the point at which they left off.\nWe invite the institutions of the international\ncommunity to play a more effective role in securing\ncompliance with the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy. They must bring the necessary pressure to\nbear on the aggressor to remove the causes of this conflict\nand lay the foundations of a just and comprehensive\npeace.\nIsrael cannot merely pay lip service to peace and\nexpect to be considered a truly peace-loving State.\nTalking about peace is one thing; Israel?s actions on the\nground are another. Israel?s claim that it is a weak\ncountry surrounded by hostile neighbours is one thing;\nIsrael?s military might, based on weapons of mass\ndestruction, nuclear weapons and state-of-the-art Western\nweaponry, is another. Israel has all those weapons and is\nthe mightiest Power in the Middle East. But it does not\nwant to implement or respect the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy.\nWe went to the Madrid Peace Conference with the\nother Arab parties sincerely hoping to achieve a just,\npermanent and comprehensive peace that would end the\ncontinued cycle of violence that has engulfed our region\nover the past 50 years. The negotiations on the Palestinian\ntrack remain in a vicious circle, and the repercussions of\nIsraeli intransigence could very well shatter our hopes for\npeace; the negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks\nhave come to a complete standstill as a result of the\nintransigent position of the Israeli Government.\nWe reaffirm our permanent commitment to the noble\nobjective of achieving peace. We have previously\ndeclared that the accomplishment of this goal lies in the\nfull, immediate and unconditional implementation of\nUnited Nations resolutions. On this occasion, we reiterate\nour total rejection of any settlement of Palestinian\nrefugees in Lebanon. We call upon the international\ncommunity to increase its voluntary contributions to the\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) pending the\nimplementation of international resolutions relative to\nrefugees, particularly resolution 194 (III).\nAs we repeat our commitment to a just,\ncomprehensive and permanent peace, we declare that we\n20\n\n\nin Lebanon and in Syria are ready to resume the\nnegotiations from where they were stopped. We are ready\nto sign a peace treaty with Israel within three months, on\nthe condition that it withdraws from the South, from the\nWest Beqaa, and from the Syrian Golan to the lines of 4\nJune 1967. Peace negotiations aimed at achieving a just and\ncomprehensive peace \u2014 the peace that we always\nproclaimed our desire to achieve \u2014 can only be\naccomplished on the basis of the Madrid terms of reference,\nin accordance with the principle of land for peace. These\nshould be pursued on two parallel, inseparable tracks with\nIsrael: the Lebanese negotiation track and the Syrian\nnegotiation track.\nThe interdependence of the twin tracks was a strategic\ndecision dictated by the supreme interests of both Lebanon\nand Syria. This interdependence enhances the prospects of\na just, permanent and comprehensive peace. We have\npreviously declared, and we repeat today before this\nassembly of nations, that neither Lebanon nor Syria will\nsign a separate peace agreement with Israel. Lebanon and\nSyria are committed to the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy. We continue to be committed to peace as a\nstrategic choice.\nPeace as we see it is a peace built on justice, a peace\nthat will restore usurped rights to their rightful owners fully\nand without diminution. Any initiatives that ignore these\nprinciples and bases are nothing more than manoeuvres\npredestined to failure. They will only prolong the conflict\nwith all that this implies in terms of squandering the human\nand economic resources of all concerned. They will further\npostpone the permanent, just and comprehensive peace\nwhich we still uphold and aspire to. To us, this will always\nbe the only viable means to achieve the prosperity and\nprogress of our people and of the other peoples of the\nregion.\nThe voices that were recently raised calling for the\nestablishment of military alliances in the region on the\npretext of confronting certain trends of thought can only be\nseen as attempts to bring the region back to the atmosphere\nof alliances and confrontation. Time and again, history has\nproven these to be harmful to the interests of peoples. They\ncan only lead to negative results that will obstruct the peace\nprocess.\nSo long as the Israeli occupation and assaults against\nour people continue, we shall continue to uphold our right\nto resist occupation and to use all legitimate means to\nwhich peoples who have had to endure the injustices and\nevils of occupation have resorted previously. The Lebanese\nresistance in southern Lebanon and the West Beqaa is in\npursuit of a legitimate right supported and endorsed by\nthe entire Lebanese people. The Lebanese people who,\nlike other peoples whose lands have been occupied, have\nbeen resisting occupation, and appeal to the international\ncommunity to spare no effort in helping to secure the\nrelease of its citizens who are incarcerated in Israeli\nprisons and in detention camps under Israeli control in the\noccupied Lebanese territories. Hundreds of our sons have\nbeen languishing in Israeli jails and detention camps for\nyears. Some have already served the prison sentences\nhanded down by Israeli courts, yet are still in custody for\nreasons unknown to anyone. Others have been in custody\nfor years but have not yet been arraigned. Their\nincarceration continues under an arbitrary measure that\nIsrael calls \u201cadministrative detention\u201d.\nWe have been trying to secure the release of all\nLebanese detainees from Israeli jails with the assistance\nof friendly and brotherly States and with the active\ninvolvement of the International Committee of the Red\nCross. We appeal to the United Nations and to other\ninternational humanitarian agencies to give this matter\ntheir utmost attention. We also call upon them to plead\nwith Israel to improve the living conditions of these\nprisoners, who live in unbearable, inhumane\ncircumstances that run counter to international laws and\nconventions.\nLebanon finds itself today twice victimized. On the\none hand, it has to endure continued devastating attacks\nby Israel, attacks that can be justified only under one\nrubric: Israel?s stubborn clinging to its occupation and to\nthe flimsy pretext of security. On the other hand, Lebanon\nsees how the international community is incapable of\ndoing what it takes to restore its legitimate rights through\ncompliance with the just resolutions adopted by this\ninternational Organization, in particular Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978), which calls for unconditional\nIsraeli withdrawal from the Lebanese territories. Lebanon,\nwhich for 50 years has dearly paid for the establishment\nof Israel, suffers from the double standards which have so\nfar obstructed the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978).\nThe United Nations, which has made continuous\nefforts, and whose peacekeeping forces have made the\nultimate sacrifice, in the South, remains the best witness\nto the indiscriminate nature and ferocity of the Israeli\nattacks against the Lebanese. The United Nations\npeacekeeping forces have repeatedly been the direct target\nof Israeli bombardment, including the 1996 shelling of the\n21\n\n\nheadquarters of a battalion of the United Nations Interim\nForce in Lebanon, in Qana, which was the scene of a\nheinous massacre in which scores of Lebanese lost their\nlives. Here we would like to pay tribute to the fallen\nsoldiers of the United Nations who have died in Lebanon,\nvictims of Israeli acts of aggression. Lebanon considers\nthem to be its martyrs too. From this rostrum, we honour\ntheir memory. We salute each and every member of the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping Force stationed in Lebanon.\nWe express special thanks and appreciation to the friendly\nStates that have contributed troops to that Force. On the\noccasion of the departure of the Norwegian battalion that\nhas worked in Lebanon for over two decades, allow me to\nexpress, on behalf of the people and the Government of\nLebanon, our thanks and gratitude to the Norwegian people\nand Government for their enduring commitment to and\nparticipation in the Force. Many members of the Norwegian\nbattalion sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.\nLebanon has the right to demand that the international\ncommunity and the United Nations, which represents\ninternational legitimacy, should make every effort to secure\nIsrael?s compliance with international resolutions and its\nwithdrawal from its territories.\nLebanon, which believes in peace, will work with its\nbrothers to consolidate this peace and make it a foundation\nfor a new life in the Middle East region. Achieving this\nnoble objective will not only translate just resolutions into\ntangible action, but it will also further the confidence of\nsmall States and nations in an authority that will guarantee\ntheir rights, their very existence and their future.\nIn conclusion, I would like to address the Israeli\npeople to tell them that the Arabs, specifically Lebanon and\nSyria, have taken a strategic decision, namely the peace\noption, which is the difficult choice. This is the strategic\noption which we uphold and for which we work in the\ninterest of the future of our nation and that of our children.\nFor peace to be realized, Israel also has to follow suit for\nthe sake of the future of its children. Peace requires courage\nand a broad vision of the future. Lebanon and Syria have\nmade their choice. Will Israel make the same choice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on\nhis election to the important post of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. This is a testimony to the\nwidespread recognition of the country that he represents. I\nam convinced that his rich experience and diplomatic skill\nwill allow him to successfully conduct this session of the\nAssembly and deal with the important tasks before it.\nI would also like to express my sincere thanks to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine,\nMr. Udovenko, for his fruitful work over the past year.\nIt would be difficult to underestimate the importance\nof the United Nations in the fields of peace and security,\ndevelopment, human rights, ecology and economic\ncooperation. Kyrgyzstan wishes deeply to see the\nOrganization successfully reformed. The SecretaryGeneral\u2019s \u201cquiet revolution\u201d of institutional reforms, begun\na year ago, has given new strength to the United Nations\nmechanism.\nThe first, most important steps towards making this\nrevolution a success have already been taken, but a great\ndeal remains to be done. As the previous session showed,\nthe process of reforming the Organization so that it is\nprepared to respond to the challenges of the coming\nmillennium will require more time and more work than\nexpected.\nThe reforms of the United Nations will be\nincomplete if they do not apply to all of its organs,\nincluding the Security Council. We judge the Council by\nits effectiveness. In that connection, we support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal to expand the role of the\nCouncil. We share his view that the Council should deal\nwith economic and social processes, which have an\nimpact on peace and security, just as energetically as it\nworks to resolve political issues. We also believe it\nessential not only to improve the working methods of the\nCouncil, but also to expand its membership. In our\nopinion, the quantitative expansion of the Council should\ntake place in both categories of membership and provide\nfor equitable geographic representation. Further, the new\npermanent members of the Council should have all the\nprivileges appropriate to their status.\nThe difficult reform process that all aspects of\nKyrgyz society have been undergoing during the seven\nyears of our independence has yielded certain results. The\nmain result has been the preservation of political stability,\nfurther democratization of the society and the extension\nof economic reforms.\nLacking access to the sea, Kyrgyzstan is seeking\nnew transport routes, which are essential for facilitating\nthe movement of goods, capital and services into the\nregion. It is acquiring new information technology and\nelectronic communications, which will help the country\nmodernize. Kyrgyzstan wishes to develop regional\ncooperation within the framework of the Central Asian\neconomic community and the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States. It also believes in the necessity of\ncooperation with other regions.\nIn that connection, I would like to mention the\ntimeliness and importance of President A. Akayev\u2019s\ndoctrine of \u201cSilk Road Diplomacy\u201d. A revival of the idea\nof the great Silk Road presupposes the transformation of\nthe area along the road into a zone of stability, security,\ncooperation and equitable partnership. The idea of\nreviving this road also represents a commitment to\ncreating favourable conditions for increased international\ncooperation so that we can take joint action to solve the\nglobal problems that confront mankind at the threshold of\nthe third millennium.\nThe national strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic\nhighlights sustainable development as the basis for stable\nand secure human development as we enter the new\nmillennium. The implementation of the decisions adopted\nat the World Summit for Social Development are of\n29\n\n\nimmense importance for the Kyrgyz Republic. For countries\nwith economies in transition \u2014 countries seeking to find\ntheir way to sustainable growth \u2014 it is especially important\nthat there be coordination and joint action within a\nrevitalized United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions\nand regional organizations in order to accelerate the\nintegration of these countries into the world economy.\nA priority for Kyrgyz development is solving the\nthree-headed problem of modern times: how to promote the\neconomy, ecology and social development. I should point\nout that ecology is the cornerstore of sustainable\ndevelopment for Kyrgyzstan. The harmony of man and\nnature is at the heart of the sustainable development\nprogramme adopted by the Government of Kyrgyzstan last\nyear.\nKyrgyzstan is a mountainous country; most of its\nterritory \u2014 95 per cent \u2014 is covered by mountains.\nMountains, as is well known, are an important source of\nfresh water, biological diversity, mineral resources and\nenergy, as well as being extremely important for tourism.\nAt the same time, however, mountains means surprises and\ndangers. Earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, floods \u2014 all\nthreaten human lives and require enormous financial and\nmaterial expenditures. In that connection, Kyrgyzstan is\ndeeply grateful to United Nations Member States for their\nsupport of its initiative to declare the year 2002 an\ninternational year of mountains, and we request them to\ncontinue to support the initiative at this session of the\nAssembly.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s policy of peace, which is\nfocused on the new trend towards a multipolar global\nsystem, presupposes, inter alia, a safe, non-nuclear future.\nThe specific steps Kyrgyzstan has taken in the area of\nnuclear disarmament and in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime confirm its commitment to this policy.\nAppropriately, the Central Asian countries\u2019 initiative\nto create a nuclear-weapon-free zone was on the agenda of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. During\nthat session a resolution on the establishment of such a\nzone in Central Asia was adopted by consensus.\nToday it is a pleasure for me to state that the\nconsultative meeting of experts of Central Asian countries,\nnuclear-weapon States and the United Nations, which took\nplace on 9 and 10 July in Bishkek, laid the legal foundation\nfor the Central Asian initiative. This is a new stage in the\ncreation of the zone. In this connection, we believe it useful\nto continue regular meetings between experts of the\nregional working group and those of the nuclear-weapon\nStates, with the participation of representatives of the\nUnited Nations and the International Atomic Energy\nAgency.\nThis year\u2019s session coincides with the fiftieth\nanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nKyrgyzstan completely supports the peacekeeping efforts\nthe Organization has undertaken in various global hot\nspots. At the same time, we believe that, along with\npeacekeeping operations, more attention should be paid to\nthe early prevention of conflicts \u2014 so-called preventive\nor quiet diplomacy aimed at preventing disputes from\nturning into conflicts.\nKyrgyzstan is seriously concerned by the armed\nconflict that has lasted for almost two decades in\nAfghanistan. We are also seriously alarmed at the military\nconfrontation and the grave humanitarian situation in\nKosovo, the situation in Africa and the absence of\nprogress in the Middle East, Cyprus and the Korean\npeninsula.\nHowever, we are equally concerned about the\nfinancial crises in South-East Asia, Russia and Latin\nAmerica and the nuclear- weapons tests conducted by\nIndia and Pakistan. For, as history shows, the sources of\nconflict, despite being very different, are at the same time\nvery similar. Armed conflicts are accompanied by\nviolence, mass exodus of refugees, illegal trafficking in\ndrugs and weapons and flagrant disregard for and\nviolations of human rights. The territory of countries\nexperiencing armed conflicts is often utilized to train\nprofessional mercenaries and terrorists.\nTerrorism long ago crossed national borders and\nbecame international in nature. Thousands of innocent\npeople have become its victims, including children,\nwomen and elderly people. Particular phenomena of the\npast century have been terrorist bombings and nuclear\nterrorism. We support the proposals for accelerating work\non a draft convention to combat acts of nuclear terrorism.\nKyrgyzstan firmly opposes any form or type of terrorism\nand calls on the international community to pool its\nefforts against this global threat.\nKyrgyzstan\u2019s six years as a Member of the United\nNations have been a good training ground for\nparticipation in the United Nations family. Together with\nother countries, we have striven to establish a world of\ngreater justice, to achieve social progress in the interest of\n\nhumankind and to assert human dignity and equal rights for\nall.\nAs the twenty-first century draws closer, what the\nworld becomes will depend primarily on our joint efforts \u2014\nthe efforts of all United Nations Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I start, Sir, by\ncongratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of\nthis great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides\nits deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country,\nUruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth\nand hospitality on that occasion.\nI would also like to express our thanks to his\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with\nconsiderable commitment, presided over the introduction\nof many important reform measures during the past\nsession.\nEach year this debate provides an opportunity to take\na longer perspective on the United Nations \u2014 to look\nback and, of course, to look ahead. We have\nachievements to acknowledge and challenges for the\nfuture to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by\npresent-day conditions. We are living in very difficult\ntimes. The economic events that have unfolded over the\nlast year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a\nglobal impact. They will affect developed and developing\ncountries alike across most regions of the world. The\nproblems that face us demand a calm and steady response\nif financial troubles are not to spill over into wider\ninstability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and\na test of the component parts of the multilateral system.\nThis year we mark 50-year milestones in two major\nareas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish\nthis half-century from earlier times: international\npeacekeeping and the development of international human\nrights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the\nchallenges of the present day. Both typify the unique\ncontribution of the United Nations system. It is in this\nglobal setting that universal international norms can be\nestablished. The international rule of law gives us a\nframework with which to deal confidently with the\n7\n\n\nproblems that confront us. And it is through collective\nsecurity that the countries of the world can work together\nto promote and reinforce peace and stability.\nNew Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset\nvalued the opportunities for global debate and collective\naction provided by the United Nations. We are committed\nto the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective\noperation is essential to the well-being of our world.\nWe are, of course, as many are, conscious of the\ncriticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in\nrecent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was\nvery high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding\na new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces\nwere awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the\ndecade there was talk of a new world order.\nBut the world community?s expectations of what could\nbe achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? own\npolitical will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery,\nwhich had grown and expanded to meet world expectations,\nproved too cumbersome \u2014 and often very costly \u2014 to\nrespond effectively.\nEuphoria about the United Nations began to give way\nto cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the\nUnited Nations as \u201ca busted flush\u201d. But when we take a\nlonger view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is\nthe appropriate reaction.\nSince the end of the cold war the United Nations\npeacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.\nThere have been some marked successes and, regrettably,\nsome failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping\nmandates must reflect the lessons learned.\nThe need for the United Nations to be able to carry\nout its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to\nwhat it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the\nblue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive\ntimely reimbursement.\nThe largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping and\nthe regular budget cast a long shadow over the\nOrganization. Dues outstanding at present have reached\nalarming proportions. This affects all \u2014 large nations and\nsmall nations.\nWe cannot afford to have the capacity of the United\nNations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.\nIn my own area of the South Pacific we developed\na regional response to a regional problem. I am referring\nto the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an\nisland which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but\nhas enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the\nGovernments of the region that set out to help the\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea and representatives of\nthe Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.\nThe contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon\nIslands and my own country have played a valuable and\nsignificant role, and there is now growing hope and\nconfidence on Bougainville \u2014 rare commodities for\nalmost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in\nChristchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing\nthe ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations\nparticipation. We welcomed the United Nations decision\nto set up a small political office on the island. This\ncommitment by the United Nations will help strengthen\nthe peace process there.\nToday the world faces uncertainty caused by the\nfinancial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the\nRussian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin\nAmerica under pressure and is now touching just about\neverybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and\nthe reversal of developing markets? short capital flows has\ndramatically changed economic and social prospects.\nWorld economic growth this year will be significantly\nreduced.\nThis most serious economic situation in many years\nhas the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must\ncooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national\nlevel we must take the actions required, not just for our\nown sakes but in the interests of the broader international\ncommunity. This includes refraining from protectionist\nreactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing\nahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.\nA serious challenge is to ensure that economic\ninsecurity does not threaten political and social stability.\nWe must resist pressures to take political actions that we\nwould normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is\nthrough a collective approach to the problems that\nconfront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in\nthe United Nations system and elsewhere and build\nconfidence in our joint ability to work through difficult\ntimes.\nI was particularly struck by the comments of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in\nhis statement on Monday. His characterization of the\n8\n\n\ncrisis \u2014 that it is not just financial or economic or social\nor political, but all of these things at once \u2014 is exactly\nright. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?s\nconclusion that we must address the crisis on all these\nfronts.\nAs a forum for debate, and as a body capable of\ntaking global action, the United Nations, together with its\nspecialized agencies, has an important role to play in\nbuilding capacity and providing social support where it is\nneeded. Much of what the United Nations has achieved\nprovides the norms and mechanisms to help us through\ndifficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The\nchallenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle\nthe problems that have the potential to undermine our\nsecurity, problems that have their greatest impact on\nordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the\ntime to go backwards.\nRecent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam\nhave underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from\nover. The response to terrorism must be decisive and\nunequivocal. The international community has a duty to\nensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.\nUniversal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist\ninstruments must be a fundamental objective of all\nMembers of this Organization.\nWar crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a\nresurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New\nZealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes\nTribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not\nenough. New Zealand has long called for an international\ncriminal court that would have jurisdiction over such\ncrimes. We commend the effort of those who, through\nmuch hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the\nStatute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.\nIt is our expectation that, with the support of the\ninternational community, the Court will prove an effective\ntool in the fight against those who carry out appalling\natrocities.\nNowhere is the need for multilateral action more\nclearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental\ndegradation and promote sustainable development.\nNew Zealand is honoured to have our own\nEnvironment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh\nsession. It is our strong hope that this session will see us\nadvance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards\nachieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years\nago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of\nthe Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans and\nseas and the review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States in preparation for next year?s special\nsession of the General Assembly.\nThe Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change adopted last\nDecember was a positive first step in dealing with this\nquintessentially global problem. There remain some\nimportant implementation issues to be resolved. The\nFourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will\nprovide an opportunity to make further progress.\nThanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General,\nwe now have an Organization that is efficient and\neffective. There is more to be done if this great\nOrganization is to meet the challenges of the present day:\nchanges that make it possible to redirect efforts from the\nadministration of the Organization to its front-line work\nin development and confronting global problems.\nNew Zealand looks forward to continuing the\ndialogue on financing for development. Through our\ncurrent membership of the Economic and Social Council\nwe have followed closely the evolving debate on this very\nimportant issue. We very much welcome the initiatives\ntaken by the Organization towards closer linkages with\nthe Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are\nthemselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the\npresent economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge\nthey have ever had. However, we must decide whether in\ntheir present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThis Organization, too, like any other, needs to\nrespond to changing circumstances, and be flexible\nenough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world\nof today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.\nThe East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need\nto address anew the divide between North and South. The\nUnited Nations development role is crucial. Once again I\nbelieve the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head\nwhen he described in his statement on Monday the need\nto restore development to its proper place in global\neconomic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up\ntrade and investment flows, and promote access to\ninformation and technology. All of these are tools with\nwhich to fight the economic downturn which is\nconfronting us.\n9\n\n\nThe United Nations clearly has the leading role to play\nin development. Other international institutions play a\ncomplementary part. I am personally conscious of the\nparticular contribution made by the Commonwealth through\nthe recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That\nMission highlighted the special vulnerability of small\nStates, which has led to the establishment of the\nCommonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which\nwill have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social\nCouncil and the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.\nWithin the United Nations we need to correct the\nNorth-South imbalance to which I referred through reform\nof the Security Council. More equitable representation on\nthe Council would better reflect the world as it is and\ntoday?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex\nissue, but there has been some good progress this year in\nthe equally important area of reforming the Council?s\nworking methods. Altogether, these are matters which\nrequire careful consideration and negotiation. Setting\nartificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform\npackage would not be helpful and could in fact prove\ndamaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the\nsupport of the greatest possible number of Member States.\nI should add that regional groups in the United\nNations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly\nopen to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to\ncreate a more equitable distribution of electoral\nopportunities and to recognize modern-day political and\neconomic linkages.\nIn the field of disarmament and arms control, it is\ntimely to consider how far we have come and what we\nhave achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end\nof nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm\nwas shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising\ngrave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken\nsome encouragement from statements made in this Hall in\nrecent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which\nall countries that have not yet done so will sign up\nunconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty.\nThe Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to\nproceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations\nconcluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping\nback from the objective of complete disarmament, including\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?s\ncommitment to this objective was reiterated in the\ndeclaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers\nof seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand\nis now working with those countries on a draft resolution\nbased on the concerns outlined in the declaration.\nOne achievement which I personally see as a top\npriority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification\nprotocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production and Stockpiling of\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\nTheir Destruction. Following a very successful initiative\nfrom Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of\nministers who this week issued a statement urging\nGovernments to commit themselves to completing this\ntask.\nNew Zealand supports the actions of the United\nNations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles of\nweapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to\nthe security of the region. We urge the Government of\nIraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations\nSpecial Commission so that the elimination of these\ndreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security\nCouncil can once more address the question of lifting\nsanctions.\nIn the 50 years since Member States adopted the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance\nof the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time\nagain. Yet there remains much to be done before the\nvision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be\nrealized for all. We are confident that, under the\nleadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,\nwe will continue to make good progress towards the\nrealization of that vision.\nThe United Nations can add value in promoting and\nprotecting fundamental human rights standards,\nemphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have\nbeen supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in this\narea, and we will continue to do so.\nWe see countries in all regions of the world seeking\nthe international community?s support as they build\nstructures to provide good governance and deliver hope\nand greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am\nencouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra\nLeone in this regard.\nAs the last 50 years have demonstrated, this\nOrganization has added a whole new dimension to\n10\n\n\ncooperation among nations. No lesser body could have\nachieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it\nwill be the dramatic development of the international rule\nof law and the evolution of collective approaches to\nsecurity, both political and economic, which will\ncharacterize our era. In other words, that really is the work\nof the United Nations.\nNow, with the challenge of the economic problems\nthat face us, we nations of the world are more dependent\nthan ever on solving our shared problems together. New\nZealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations\nand to the ideals that this Organization stands for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to convey my sincere\ncongratulations to Mr. Opertti upon his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session and to\nexpress my full confidence that he will lead its work\nwisely and ably.\nIt gives me pleasure as well to pay tribute to the\nwise leadership of the former Foreign Minister of\nUkraine, President of the Assembly at its last session,\nparticularly in promoting the efforts for reform and\nrenewal in the United Nations.\n14\n\n\nI would like also to salute the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who displayed his wisdom and expertise\nin dealing with world crises and for his outstanding\ncontribution to increasing the efficiency of the Organization\nin order for it to keep pace with the changing times,\ncontribute to the building of the new international order and\navoid the pitfalls.\nThis is the next-to-last session of the General\nAssembly in this century. Let it be a session for reflection\nand preparation for the last session of the twentieth century,\nnext year. Let us take stock of the international work of a\nwhole century, its positive and negative aspects alike. Let\nus evaluate the achievements and innovations of mankind,\nwhere it failed and why. Let us list and analyse the work\ndone and the progress made by the United Nations to create\nconstructive international cooperation and establish peace.\nLet us also talk about what remains on the international\nagenda and what will be left for succeeding generations to\nfinish and accomplish.\nIn the Charter of the United Nations, we determined\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\nHave we done so? Where did we succeed, where did we\nfail, and why? We also reaffirmed our faith in fundamental\nhuman rights and in the dignity of nations and human\nbeings. How far have we gone in translating this solemn\nreaffirmation into a reality? We committed ourselves to\npromoting social progress and better standards of life, and\nto using the United Nations for the promotion of the social\nand economic advancement of all peoples. Have we\nhonoured that commitment? We determined to practise\ntolerance and live together in peace and neighbourliness.\nHave we achieved that? We determined to unite our\nstrength to maintain international peace and security and not\nto use armed force except for common interest. Has this\ndetermination come true? Have we achieved what we\ndetermined to do?\nImmediately after the end of the cold war in the late\n1980s, some spoke of \u201cthe clash of civilizations\u201d. This is a\ndangerous theory that concerns humanity and the course it\nwill chart for itself \u2014 whether conflict and conflagration or\ncoexistence and peace. We, the representatives of the\ninternational community, cannot, at this historical juncture,\nignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory\nthat runs counter to the common work and collective\nobligations we agreed upon for international life. We, the\nchildren of the twentieth century, must deal with this theory\nand respond to it clearly. We cannot let such a negative call\ngo without a response or correction. What President Clinton\nsaid in his address before the Assembly, rejecting this\ntheory and expressing respect for Islamic civilization, is\nreally worthy of consideration and appreciation.\nIn our opinion, we must offer the next century our\nconfident view that we are one community based on\npluralism \u2014 intellectual, religious and cultural pluralism\nand diversity. We must reaffirm that this diversity does\nnot prejudice the unity of the international community.\nRather, it strengthens that unity, making the international\ncommunity a dynamic whole based on healthy\ncompetition, positive coexistence and a common\nappreciation for the achievements of the many societies\nthat constitute the international community. Our\ncommunity cannot be dependent on the achievements of\none single society or tend to follow one single culture.\nThe true path lies in positive interaction, complementarity\nand coexistence among civilizations. It does not lie in the\ncreation of causes for conflict or in fanning the flames of\nconfrontation and of clash between civilizations. If this is\nallowed to happen, it will create a dangerous hotbed of\nworld tension and will ultimately result in a grave loss for\none and all.\nOnce again we are at a historic juncture where a\nstrong message from this generation is indeed necessary.\nWe want to see the rights of people and nations upheld\nwithout differences as to priorities and definitions. We\nwant rational disarmament and an end to the arms race\nwithout distinction or discrimination. We want genuine\ndevelopment that does not entrench poverty or ignore its\ncauses. We want a clean environment, a science that\nbenefits all and a technology whose achievements and\napplications are beneficial to all. We want a common\nposition in the face of international terrorism. We want\nfreedom and liberation for all peoples and a firm stand in\nthe face of the forces of oppression, racism and\noccupation. We want a commitment to the rule of law\nand respect for established norms and for the purposes\nand principles we consensually consecrated in the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nIn order to evaluate the experiences of the past and\nto chart our future course, I propose that this session\ncreate a committee to commence drafting a clear\nstatement to history to be issued at the close of the next\nsession. This statement should include our assessment of\nthe past and our vision of the future. It should be issued\na few days before the end of the century and the\nbeginning of the new millennium.\nThe world today is passing through a stage of chaos,\nand there is a general feeling of discontent. Wars,\n15\n\n\nterrorism, backwardness, racism, religious intolerance: are\nthese the remnants of past eras? Or are they the result of\npractices that continue to plague our societies? Or are they\nan integral part of the fabric of human life? Or are they the\nresult of globalization and the factors of tension and\ninstability contained in the new world order?\nI believe we all sense the instability in international\nlife. We have witnessed and continue to witness widespread\nacts of terrorism throughout all continents of the world. We\nhave witnessed widespread extremism in various faiths and\nwidespread injustice in various societies. All this points to\nthe fact that richness and poverty, despite their undisputed\nimportance as two of the facts of life, do not constitute the\nonly causes of world instability. There are other causes,\nforemost among which is the policy of double standards,\nthe lack of democracy in international relations, the brazen\ncall for a clash of civilizations and the varying\ninterpretations of the principles of legality. All these\nelements lead to the feeling of discontent, indeed, to the\ngeneral feeling of insecurity.\nI believe it is incumbent upon us to consider this\nmatter. These questions call for a clear answer because the\nchallenge is enormous, and the results could therefore be\ngrave. We are all in the same boat. This responsibility is\nnot the responsibility of any one society. If globalization\nand universality are much talked about, this should mean\nthat they call for a sharing of responsibility.\nI would like to deal briefly with some of the central\nissues that occupy our minds at this stage.\nI shall start with terrorism. Some note, and rightly so,\nthat this international crime against all societies is\nperpetrated using tight organizations, facilitated sometimes\nby circumstances in which some have misguidedly\nsupported certain groups by encouraging and dealing with\nthem until those groups turned against them. This is a\nlesson we must learn in order to avoid its repetition.\nFurthermore, some have noted, and rightly so, that the hand\nof terrorism has struck more than one place at the same\ntime: Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and Omagh in Ireland. Before\nthen, that hand of terrorism struck many places in the\nworld, for different motives, certainly. But the phenomenon\nis one and the same, and it is intolerable. We must reflect\nupon this matter together.\nIn this regard, I would like to underline the importance\nof the legislation enacted by the British House of Commons\non dealing with the acts of conspiracy committed on British\nterritory, of the proposal of President Jacques Chirac of\nFrance on controlling the financing of terrorist groups,\nand of what was said by President Clinton in his\nstatement before the Assembly in this regard. I find it\nimportant also in this connection to put before the\nAssembly the call of President Hosni Mubarak to convene\nan international summit under the auspices of the United\nNations. The summit should direct the international\ncommunity to deal with terrorism legally, politically,\neconomically and technologically. This call was supported\nin the final communiqu\u00e9 of the recent summit of the Non-\nAligned Movement. I suggest that the General Assembly\nconsider the Egyptian call for the proposed summit. I also\ncall upon the Secretary-General to start working towards\nits convening.\nTurning to disarmament, allow me to say that recent\ndevelopments have proved the shortcomings of the\nnuclear non-proliferation regime in its current form,\nwhich lacks universality. This reaffirms the need for\nurgent and serious steps to remedy that shortcoming, and\nto strengthen the efficiency of the regime through\nachieving its universality and avoiding the policy of\ndouble standards; otherwise, we will end up with a state\nof deep mistrust and an arms race that would in turn lead\nto the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nespecially nuclear weapons.\nFor the last three decades, Egypt has consistently\ncalled for making the Middle East free from nuclear\nweapons. This call was further reinforced by its 1990\ninitiative to make the region free from weapons of mass\ndestruction. Today, we reiterate this call with a view to\nmaintaining peace and security in the region.\nStarting from this same premise, Egypt, together\nwith seven other States, recently proposed a new agenda\nto strengthen the international commitment towards a\nworld free of weapons of mass destruction, an initiative\nwe invite the Assembly to support. In this connection,\nallow me to place on record the call of President Hosni\nMubarak to convene an international conference to\nconsider the elimination of those weapons from the whole\nworld within an agreed time-frame. I invite members of\nthe Assembly to work together in order to translate that\ncall into a reality.\nI now move to the question of the reform of the\nUnited Nations. Here, the premise of the Egyptian policy\nis the same as that adopted by the summit of the Non-\nAligned Movement in Durban: we call for commitment to\nthe principles of the Charter and international law as a\ncommon position on the agenda for reform.\n16\n\n\nHere, I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his ideas and initiatives in this regard. I would\nalso like to reaffirm what the summit of the Non-Aligned\nMovement adopted concerning the importance of taking\ninto account the views of the Member States of the United\nNations in the implementation of the reform policies and\nthe reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the General\nAssembly in the decision-making process, as the main\ndemocratic framework of the United Nations.\nConcerning the Security Council, the position of Egypt\nis based on the same elements adopted by the non-aligned\nStates as follows: first, the need to deal with the questions\nof the reform of the working methods of the Security\nCouncil and the expansion of its membership within an\nintegrated framework; secondly, increasing the membership\nof the Security Council by no fewer than 11 members and\nthe allocation of a number of permanent seats for\ndeveloping countries, with strict observance of the\nprinciples of equitable geographical distribution and\nequality of States; thirdly, the unacceptability of any\nattempt at a partial or selective expansion of the\nmembership of the Security Council; fourthly, the\ninadmissibility of any predetermined time-frame to\ncomplete the process of restructuring the Security Council;\nand lastly, the need for any resolution that would result in\namending the Charter, the so-called framework resolution,\nto be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the States\nMembers of the United Nations, in accordance with Article\n108 of the Charter.\nIn addition, Egypt is committed to the decision of the\nsummit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in\nHarare in 1997 on the allocation of five non-permanent\nseats and two permanent seats for the African continent, to\nbe rotated in accordance with agreed criteria of the Group\nof African States.\nOn the subject of the reform of the United Nations, I\nwould like to refer to a matter that was the subject of\nextensive deliberations in the United Nations and in the\nrecent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement \u2014 namely,\nthe sanctions imposed by the Security Council. As the\nultimate objective of such sanctions is to influence certain\npolitical regimes to bring them into compliance with the\nrules of international legality, it is therefore necessary that\nall means under Chapter VI of the Charter be exhausted\nbefore resorting to Chapter VII and its applications. The\nclarity of the objective of imposing sanctions and a\nthorough consideration of their consequences in the short\nand long terms, including human suffering, are of\nparamount importance.\nAn excessive imposition of sanctions, or their\nperpetuation without acceptable reason or a clear time-\nframe, will erode their credibility and the commitments\nmade to applying them. Therefore, there is a need for\npatience, prudence and a determination of the time-frame\nof sanctions.\nI now turn to the Middle East, which is suffering\nfrom numerous problems, some chronic and others fairly\nrecent, which we hope will not also become chronic ones.\nI am referring here to the situation of Iraq, which must\nreach its natural conclusion: the lifting of the sanctions\nthrough implementation of the Security Council?s\nresolutions and in accordance with their provisions. This\nrequires goodwill, proper conduct and the establishment\nof constructive and stable cooperation between Iraq and\nthe mechanisms of the Security Council. This is a shared\nresponsibility, not the responsibility of one party alone.\nNeedless to say, the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction in Iraq is an integral part of their elimination\nin the region as a whole, as was indeed reflected in\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991).\nI would also like to refer to the Lockerbie issue and\nexpress our satisfaction at the recent positive development\nof the situation by the consent of the parties to that yet-\nto-be settled dispute. This represents significant progress\ntowards the trial of the two suspects and establishing the\ntruth. We all hope that progress will be made, in good\nfaith, as soon as possible within the framework of the\ncontacts made by the Secretary-General and that an\nagreement will be reached on the required procedures and\nguarantees. Thus, the whole matter will be put behind us,\nthe sanctions imposed on Libya will be lifted and a long\noverdue end to a period of tension will come to pass.\nAt another level, we believe that the region must\navoid anything that could add to its tensions: declarations\nof strategic alliances that create discord and lead to\ncounter-alliances; sneaking into the nuclear club, which\nwill lead to an arms race in the region, unless Israel, like\nall other States of the region, accedes to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty; the lack of a solution to the problems\nand disputes of sovereignty, foremost among which is the\nquestion of the three islands of the United Arab Emirates\nin the Gulf; and attempts at partitioning and jeopardizing\nthe unity and territorial integrity of States, as is the case\nwith Iraq and Sudan.\nAs for the peace process, which is about to collapse,\nthe situation is indeed grave, not only because of the\ndeadlock it has reached, but also because the roots of the\n17\n\n\nproblem go much deeper than that. The deadlock is related\nto the negative change in the policy of Israel, which\nbelieves that the current international situation enables it to\nimpose its exaggerated demands on the Arab parties and to\nimpose an Israeli peace on the Middle East. This is\nprobably due to the belief which it has evolved, namely that\nno person, no Government and no State would be able to\nstand in its way, pressure it or refuse its demands.\nWe reject this policy, which uses security\nconsiderations to justify occupation, thus stripping security\nrequirements, which could be legitimate, of any meaning.\nSuch requirements could have been negotiated and\nreasonable ones accepted on a reciprocal basis. Yet the\nvalidity, true weight and credibility of those Israeli security\nrequirements have become dubious. Egypt, the first Arab\nState to establish peace with Israel and the largest one with\na role in the Middle East and the Arab and Islamic worlds,\ncannot accept such negative policies, which will drive the\nregion once more towards the flames of tension, conflict\nand instability.\nWe have made peace with Israel. The Arab States\nhave moved towards the same objective on the basis of\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967), which is based on\nthe principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of\nterritory by force and on Israel?s right to live in peace\nwithin its borders \u2014 which are, of course, the borders and\nthe lines of June 1967 \u2014 as well as on the basis of the\nMadrid framework, namely, the principle of land for peace.\nWith respect to the Palestinians, the Oslo accord provides\nfor significant Israeli withdrawals before the final status\nnegotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides can\nbegin.\nAt their summit meeting in Cairo in 1996, Arab\nleaders at the highest level expressed the commitment of\nArab States to the peace process, since Arab-Israeli peace\nis a strategic objective to be achieved under international\nlegality. But it requires a corresponding commitment from\nIsrael to follow the road to peace in a manner that restores\nthe rights and the occupied territories of the Palestinians\nand ensures balanced and equal security to all the States of\nthe region, in accordance with the principle of land for\npeace.\nThe Arab summit decided that any disruption by Israel\nof these principles and bases of the peace process; that any\nreneging on the commitments it has made and agreements\nreached on the same path; and that any procrastination in\ntheir implementation will only set back the peace process.\nThe attendant dangers and repercussions of such actions\nwould relaunch the region into the spiral of tension and\ncompel the Arab States to reconsider the steps they have\ntaken towards Israel within the framework of the peace\nprocess. The Israeli Government alone would bear the full\nresponsibility for such a development.\nRegrettably, it has become evident that the Israeli\nGovernment is reneging on the commitments it has\nundertaken in the context of the Security Council?s\nresolutions, the Madrid framework and the Oslo accord.\nThis attitude logically compels us to take a forthright and\ndetermined opposition to Israel?s negative position, which\nruns counter to the objective requirements for peace. If\nwe do not, the effective international action necessary to\ndeal with this grave situation will not be forthcoming.\nWe wonder what the Israeli Government really\nwants. The Arabs have given it acceptance, coexistence,\npeace and recognition. But it would seem that what the\nIsraeli Government really wants is all of the above, plus\nmost of the land and the privilege to disregard the rights\nof the Palestinians. This is simply unacceptable. Peoples\nhave their dignity and the rights to their own land and to\nself-determination. No generation is entitled to cede such\nrights. They are the rights of all generations \u2014 past,\npresent and future \u2014 throughout history.\nWe reiterate that Israel must reconsider its position\nand its policy. The international situation is ever\nchanging. What may be imposed today without justice or\nbalance will disintegrate tomorrow. We want a stable,\nenduring agreement. This can be achieved only once we\nagree on a comprehensive package that includes Israel?s\ncomplete withdrawal from the territories of Syria,\nLebanon, the West Bank and Gaza in Palestine; the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State; an agreement on the\nfinal status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian\nrefugees; an agreement on security requirements, without\nundue exaggeration; the recognition of Israel as a State;\nand coexistence with it as a member of the family of the\nMiddle East, within the framework of normal relations. I\nrepeat that all this must constitute a package deal that\ncannot be divided to serve the interests of one party at the\nexpense of the others.\nDoes the Israeli Government recognize the\nimportance of justice and legitimacy? Does it realize the\ngrave and present danger of spurning this opportunity to\nachieve peace? Letting this historic opportunity slip away\nand entering the next century with the file of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict still open will lead to tension and\ninstability not only in the Middle East, but in the\n18\n\n\ninternational community as a whole. Historical experience\nhas proven that tension knows no boundaries, that\ninstability cannot be confined to one specific region and\nthat international peace and security are indivisible.\nThe international community must therefore raise its\nvoice against the setback of the peace process and play its\nrole in salvaging it. We are not calling for an international\ntrial. Rather, we ask the international community to play its\nrole in safeguarding the bases of peace agreed upon\nunanimously in the Security Council and at the Madrid\nConference, and in the consideration of the measures\nnecessary to restore the process to its correct track and to\navert the eruption of further crises in the future.\nIt was in this spirit that Presidents Hosni Mubarak and\nJacques Chirac announced their initiative to convene a\nconference of States determined to save the peace. We must\nemphasize that this Franco-Egyptian initiative does not aim\nat replacing or hampering any current positive efforts. It\naims, rather, at reinforcing these efforts and ensuring their\nsuccess, particularly those of the United States, which we\nsupport as long as they seek balanced agreements.\nEgypt accords equal attention to issues of the African\ncontinent. Today, we are faced with two urgent and serious\nmatters. The first pertains to the Horn of Africa, namely,\nthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We strongly\nsupport the mediation efforts, led by the Chairman of the\nOrganization of African Unity, to arrive at a peaceful\nsolution and the continued cessation of military hostilities.\nIn this way will normalcy be restored and peace\nestablished.\nThe second question is the situation in and around the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Here, the efforts made\nby the leaders of Africa and the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral continue to be important. Such efforts preserve the\nunity and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo and establish positive relations between it and its\nneighbours in the larger context of a cessation of military\noperations and of interference in its internal affairs. They\nalso require the maintenance of its national unity within\nrational democracy.\nThe situation in Africa is being dangerously\naggravated by these problems and by the continent?s grave\nsocio-economic situation. This requires special attention,\nwhich we call on the international community and the\nUnited Nations to give.\nIn conclusion, I must refer to the phenomenon of\nglobalization. We must face its challenges and address its\nnegative aspects, while maximizing its benefits. A number\nof developing countries have successfully dealt with\nglobalization and achieved their necessary integration into\nthe world economy. At the same time, many developed\ncountries have adopted covert protectionist measures and\nnew conditionalities, such as environmental and labour\nstandards, and continue to maintain tariff barriers against\nthe primary exports of the developing countries. These\nmeasures run counter to the equitable bases of the world\ntrading system. This is an important issue which we must\naddress in the context of evaluating past achievements\nand challenges, and of shaping a new international order.\nThese are the questions which Egypt wished to put\nbefore this session as a modest contribution to shaping a\ncommon vision that would inspire the march of humanity\nin the coming decades, during which we hope that justice,\nequality, progress and prosperity will prevail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to\nconvey the apologies of President Yoweri Kaguta\nMuseveni, who was supposed to address the Assembly. He\nis unable to come to New York because of other pressing\nState duties.\nAllow me, on behalf of my delegation, to convey\nour warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. Let me pay a special tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the excellent\nmanner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I wish also to\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for all the\nendeavours he is undertaking in shaping our Organization\nto enable it to effectively meet the challenges of the next\nmillennium.\nThe United Nations has been at the forefront of\nefforts to tackle problems of international peace and\nsecurity and social and economic development. It has\nhelped many communities around the world attain peace,\ngreater security and higher standards of living. Africa\nfaces a number of challenges which must be urgently\naddressed. It is a volatile region in which a multiplicity of\nconflicts have combined to create a very explosive\natmosphere. Refugee populations have multiplied to\nprovide a further recipe for future instability. The\nsituation has been further complicated by large numbers\nof internally displaced people. Indeed, a large political\nand humanitarian tragedy is taking place in the region.\nThere is therefore an urgent need for the international\ncommunity to support Africa?s efforts to address the\nfundamental causes of the conflict.\nIt has been alleged that ethnic differences are the\nprime causes of conflict in the region. My delegation does\nnot share this view. We believe that poor leadership,\npoverty and low levels of economic development in the\nregion are the main underlying causes. The leadership in\nour region must correctly define and analyse the root\ncauses of the problems and establish clear priorities. It is\nalso imperative that, for a permanent and durable peace\nto prevail in the region, a comprehensive programme of\neconomic recovery and development be implemented in\nAfrica. Concerted efforts must therefore be made to\nreduce and ultimately eradicate poverty in the world.\nIn this regard, Uganda had the honour of hosting a\nleaders? forum in Kampala in January this year at which\nthe heads of State and Government of countries in the\neastern, southern and central regions of Africa met and\nheld discussions with the President of the World Bank.\nThat meeting, which in many ways was unique and\ninspiring, opened a new chapter in Africa?s relations with\n18\n\n\nthe Bank. It ushered in a genuine spirit of partnership\nbetween Africa and the Bank. Two of the significant\noutcomes of the meeting were, first, the decision that Africa\nwould be considered a priority development region by the\nWorld Bank and, secondly, a commitment to depoliticize\nforeign aid. It was also agreed at the meeting that African\ncountries must set their own priorities for development. It\nis the hope of my delegation that the agreements reached at\nthe Kampala leaders? forum will be translated into concrete\naction by the international community in the near future.\nWe believe that similar initiatives could be undertaken\ntogether with other organs of the United Nations system.\nFor too long, international efforts have been expended\non short-term humanitarian programmes, ignoring the long-\nterm requirements for sustainable peace and development.\nPast experience has shown that this approach cannot ensure\ndurable peace and development. Indeed, as the Secretary-\nGeneral noted in his report on the causes of conflict and the\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\nAfrica,\n\u201cPreventing such wars is no longer a matter of\ndefending States or protecting allies. It is a matter of\ndefending humanity\u201d. (A/52/871, para. 3)\nConflict prevention, including post-conflict peace-\nbuilding, requires a sustained effort to infuse funds into the\nregion. In this regard, we urge serious consideration and\nexpeditious implementation of the recommendations\ncontained in the Secretary-General?s report.\nThe massive cuts in social spending and public\ninvestments, with the attendant high levels of\nunemployment, create new centres of discontent and thus\nfurther fuel the embers of conflict. Attempts to impose\nconditionalities which are antithetical to the peace process\nand the cutting off of aid from weak Governments making\nsincere efforts to pursue reconciliation or implement peace\nagreements have been counterproductive. My delegation\nwould wish to argue for \u201cpeace-friendly\u201d structural\nadjustment programmes, if durable peace and sustainable\ndevelopment are to be achieved in Africa and elsewhere.\nA number of delegations have expressed their views\non the situation in the Great Lakes region with specific\nreference to the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo. My country was specifically accused of\ninvolvement in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. The facts of the situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo are not clear to some member States\nof this Assembly. Since, many speakers have raised this\nissue, we would like to make the following clarifications.\nUganda?s interest in the situation in the Great Lakes\nregion has always been and is still based on the\nfollowing: the need to ensure total security in all parts of\nUganda and the protection of the lives and property of the\npeople of Uganda; and the desire to ensure maximum\nstability in the Great Lakes region, because instability in\nany neighbouring country directly affects our security and\neconomy.\nThese concerns are legitimate. Our position on this\ncrisis therefore reflects our efforts to pursue those\ninterests. Before the fall of former President Mobutu, it\nwas not possible for Uganda to get cooperation from the\nthen Government in Zaire to ensure that Zairian territory\nwas not used by terrorist organizations to create insecurity\nalong the Uganda-Zaire border and inside Uganda.\nWhen President Laurent Kabila came to power it\nwas mutually agreed between Uganda and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo that our two armies would jointly\noperate in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo to contain and eventually remove the bandits\nwho were using the bases they had in the area to\ndestabilize Uganda. Pursuant to that understanding,\nUganda has since maintained a military presence in the\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in\naccordance with the provision of the bilateral agreement\nbetween our two countries. The situation in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo today necessitates that\nUganda must maintain that military presence, which is\ncrucial for the security of our country and our people.\nLet me make it clear to all and sundry that Uganda\nhas no territorial designs on the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. It is not the primary responsibility of Uganda\nto dictate the political arrangements of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. However, any internal\narrangement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nwhich does not take into account the legitimate security\nconcerns of its neighbours is our concern. We would like\nto say that unilateral military intervention by individual\ncountries or sectional intervention by groups of countries\nis unacceptable. These actions are likely to escalate the\nproblem. If there are good reasons for an intervention, it\nshould be regional, carried out, for example, through the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\n(COMESA), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or\n19\n\n\neven the United Nations, and in the context of the peace\ninitiatives that are already in place.\nWe would therefore like to stress that there are serious\nregional efforts to address the situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. We believe these efforts should be\nsupported by the entire membership of this Organization\nand by all parties that are interested in the conflict and have\na vested interest in peace and security in the Great Lakes\nregion.\nUganda?s commitment to the full respect for and\nuniversal enjoyment of human rights is well known.\nHowever, we regret that crimes are now being committed\non a daily basis against the people of Uganda by surrogate\nforces of the so-called Lord?s Resistance Army (LRA) with\nthe full knowledge and assistance of their sponsors, who do\nnot believe in freedom and respect for human rights.\nInnocent children are abducted daily, subjected to forced\nlabour and military service and made victims of other,\nsimilar crimes, with the support of the sponsors of these\nterrorist groups. The world awoke to this horrendous crime\nat the fifty-fourth session of the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights, when it adopted draft\nresolution E/CN.4/1998/L.40, which calls upon the LRA\nand its sponsors to release all the abducted children\nimmediately and unconditionally.\nMy delegation believes that without external support\nthe Lord?s Resistance Army would not be in a position to\ncommit these atrocities and defy international public\nopinion on this extremely important matter. We call upon\nthe international community to intensify pressure on the\ncountries involved to stop backing these terrorists. On the\nother hand, we wish to thank the United Nations bodies,\nnon-governmental organizations and all others who have\nbeen involved in seeking the freedom of these children. We\nhope their efforts will not be in vain.\nThe United Nations is a vibrant institution for many\nreasons, among them its unwavering support for actions\naimed at advancing freedom, peace and security. Today,\nterrorism poses a serious threat to these values. Individuals\nand organizations whose stock in trade is the violation of\nthese values roam the globe with impunity. Recent attacks\nin East Africa came at a time when we thought the world\nhad learned the futility of such senseless, wanton murder\nand destruction. It is the firm belief of my delegation that\nthe international community should collectively take action\nto deny sanctuary to these savages. Countries known to\nharbour such elements should be isolated and punished\nseverely so that human freedom can be protected. My\ndelegation further believes that this is an opportune\nmoment to convene an international conference on\nterrorism which must map out strategies to deal with this\nescalating problem.\nLast year the world had only five declared nuclear\nStates; today we have seven; next year we may have\nmore. In essence, such non-proliferation agreements as the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) have not deterred the emergence of new nuclear\nStates.\nThe philosophy of dependence on nuclear weapons\nfor security is, in a creeping and disturbing fashion,\nbecoming universal. This situation is creating new dangers\nfor the survival of mankind. My delegation believes that\na new universal security doctrine needs to evolve. All\nnuclear weapons should be eliminated. In line with this\nbelief, my delegation calls for the adoption of an action\nplan for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within a\ntime-bound framework. Such an approach should be\nuniversal, and not regional or discriminatory, if it is to\nachieve the desired goals.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\nseveral developments have taken place in the international\narena, some of which have offered hope and\nencouragement, while others have led to destruction and\ndespair.\nThe issue of Western Sahara is of concern to my\ndelegation. We are concerned by the slow progress\ntowards the holding of a United Nations-supervised\nreferendum on the self-determination of the people of that\nterritory. We appeal to the parties to overcome their\ndifferences and allow a just and impartial referendum to\ntake place.\nOn the Lockerbie incident, Uganda welcomes the\ninitial moves taken in a bid to solve the problem between\nthe United States of America and the United Kingdom on\nthe one hand and Libya on the other. We encourage the\nSecretary-General to work out comprehensive and clear\narrangements, acceptable to all concerned parties, so that\nthe matter can finally be resolved.\nToday we live in a globalized world. Globalization\nhas created new opportunities as well as grave risks and\nchallenges. Its impact has strengthened the developed\ncountries and weakened the developing countries. Such a\nsituation does not augur well for international peace and\n20\n\n\nsecurity. There is an urgent need for deliberate policies to\nreorient international trade and finance. The crisis in South-\nEast Asia should serve as a warning to the world of the\ncatastrophe that inaction will breed. The ever widening gap\nbetween the developed and the developing countries and\namong countries in the South could also become a source\nof future instability. There should be no delay in addressing\nthese problems. My delegation calls upon the developed\ncountries to honour their obligations and increase the\ntransfer of resources to the developing countries for the\ntransformation of their economies, so that they may become\nequal partners in the global economy.\nIn the recent past, despite drastic limitations in both\nhuman and financial resources, the United Nations has\nresponded admirably to the challenges of the era, including\npeacekeeping, emergency operations and development. It\nhas a commendable record which should serve to strengthen\nour confidence in the Organization.\nAs we inch our way into the twenty-first century, we\nshould translate this confidence into the necessary political\nwill to strengthen the Organization. We should demonstrate\nour faith and dedication to the United Nations and its\ncomponent parts by providing it with the resources\nnecessary to fulfil its immense mandate. Our challenge is\nto bequeath to succeeding generations a strong United\nNations, able to guarantee the principles enshrined in the\npreamble of its Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I take particular pleasure in\nextending to Mr. Didier Opertti and to his country,\nUruguay, my congratulations on his election to preside over\nthe work of this session of the General Assembly. His\neminent qualities, as well as his diplomatic experience,\nwill undoubtedly ensure the success of our work.\nI also express my deep appreciation for the wise\nleadership his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\nimprinted on the work of the fifty-second session, thus\ncontributing to the positive results achieved.\nMy country appreciates highly the creativity and the\nintellectual energy brought to United Nations affairs by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan since he took over, and we\nparticularly appreciate his efforts to streamline United\nNations structures.\nMy Government fully supported the United Nations\nprogramme of reforms aimed at conferring more\ncoherence and efficiency on the activities of the United\nNations. We have no doubt that the streamlining of the\nUnited Nations administration will have a positive impact\non the way the Organization handles the various and\ncomplex issues confronting the international community.\nThe efforts made over recent years by the\ninternational community, the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), the African subregional organizations and\nby States individually to deal with the conflicts in the\nAfrican continent have produced some positive results,\nsome of them remarkable. This has contributed to the\nrestoration of peace and the return to normalcy in several\nof the affected countries. However, the resurgence of new\nconflicts and the reappearance of other conflicts which we\nbelieved had already been resolved raise serious concerns,\nparticularly because of the threat they pose to peace and\nstability even beyond national borders. This situation\nraises the spectre of disastrous consequences for the\npopulations? well-being and security and casts a shadow\nover the much-needed economic and social development\nof the affected countries.\nA strong commitment is required on the part of the\ninternational community to find ways and means to deal\neffectively with the armed conflicts in the African\ncontinent. In Africa, as in any other region of the world,\ninternal conflicts arise whenever individuals or groups of\npeople have no channels through which they can funnel\ntheir legitimate claims through peacefully and\ndemocratically. In the end, the non-existence of dialogue,\nthe practice of intolerance and the absence of reliable\njudicial means to deal with divergences are the shortest\npath to armed conflict.\n14\n\n\nIn his recent report to the Security Council on this\nmatter, the Secretary-General made a substantial\ncontribution to the understanding of the causes of conflict\nin our continent and their relationship to development, good\ngovernance, democracy and human rights.\nMaintaining peace in fact becomes a difficult task\nwhen we witness the deepening of social gaps; while the\noverwhelming majority of the population has difficulty\nobtaining the essentials; when fundamental rights of\npopulations or parts of them, including the right to\nparticipate in the governance of their country, are not\nrecognized or respected; or when citizens or groups of\ncitizens are discriminated against on the basis of ethnic,\ncultural, religious or political considerations.\nThis situation is compounded by the temptation of\noutside interference aimed at imposing policies or exerting\ninfluence on Governments \u2014 most of the time causing or\naggravating conflict situations.\nThe virus of violence and conflicts that plagues\nAfrican regions and countries thrives in the precarious\nliving conditions of millions of Africans and the non-\nrecognition in practice of the most fundamental rights of\ncitizenship. Whenever one faces rampant famine, illiteracy,\nignorance, illness and oppression, whenever human dignity\nis not secured by the lofty ideals of full-fledged democracy,\nor whenever the respect for human rights is not widely\nupheld, then peace, stability and progress are in question.\nIt is evident that if one wants to reduce the occurrence\nof armed conflicts it is imperative to uphold respect for the\nfundamental rights of citizenship, tolerance and social\njustice and to support the creation of better living\nconditions that comes with economic development.\nThe United Nations, as the main guarantor of peace in\nthe world, has a major role to play in the mobilization of\nthe resources and political will needed to confront African\ncountries? colossal needs and overcome the prevalent\nsituation of underdevelopment and intolerance, which in the\nend favour the occurrence or persistence of armed conflicts.\nHowever, it must be recognized that it is up to African\nStates, their leaders \u2014 especially those that hold the reins\nof power \u2014 and their respective civil societies to assume\ncourageously their responsibilities, particularly in respect of\nthe promotion of the sound and fair management of their\nresources, the consolidation of democratic institutions, the\nobservation of and respect for the rights of citizenship and\nthe creation of a climate of tolerance and respect for the\ndignity and liberty of the human person.\nThe sisterly country of Guinea-Bissau has gone\nthrough a difficult period in her history over the last two\nmonths, as it has been faced with an internal armed\nconflict. My country, which together with the other\nPortuguese-speaking countries shares with Guinea-Bissau\na long common history, has been following with\nparticular attention the situation unfolding in that sisterly\ncountry and has not spared any effort in contributing to\nthe search for a political and negotiated solution to the\ncrisis.\nIn the framework of the Community of Portuguese-\nSpeaking Countries (CPLP) Contact Group, which we\nhave the honour to be coordinating, we will continue to\ngive our best efforts to support a peaceful resolution of\nthe crisis, and we hope that the joint mediation initiative\nof the CPLP and the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States will come to play an efficient and decisive\nrole in the ongoing peace process.\nWe hope that the parties to the conflict will continue\nto strictly observe the ceasefire agreement signed at Praia\non 25 August and will also continue to show tolerance to\nenable Guinea-Bissau society to be reconciled soon.\nThe difficult situation prevailing in Angola, a\ncountry to which we are bound by profound brotherly ties\nand a long common history, demands a strong and\ndecisive commitment on the part of the international\ncommunity in order to restore as soon as possible\ncompliance with the obligations entered into in the\nframework of the Lusaka Protocol, while bearing in mind\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. Of particular\nconcern to my country is the spectre of new armed\nconfrontations in Angola, raised by UNITA?s regrettable\ndefiance. The brotherly people of Angola, who for many\nyears have been victimized by the prevailing situation of\nwar, have the right to peace, political stability and a\nmuch-needed national reconciliation.\nThe current international financial crisis that recently\nshook the economies of many countries, especially in\nAsia, seems to raise increasing concerns for all of us. It\nraises doubts about prospects for continuing the global\nprosperity which, fuelled by economic growth, once\nseemed so long-lasting. The former optimistic outlook has\nlately been called into question, especially in respect to\ndeveloping nations, by a series of financial setbacks that\n15\n\n\npose a threat to social stability, cohesion and peace in the\naffected countries.\nThe rapid degradation of economies considered to be\nhealthy and in full expansion only months ago has been the\nobject of the special attention and concern of many that\nhave spoken from this rostrum in the last few days. The\nfear and apprehensions that the stability of many States\nmay be affected negatively by the fallout resulting from the\ndynamics of globalization raise justifiable concern,\nparticularly about the speculative attacks against the\neconomies of certain developing nations or the maintenance\nof not so transparent management practices.\nAt question is the equilibrium of the world economy,\nthe disturbance of which may have disastrous\nconsequences \u2014 economic and otherwise \u2014 for all of us.\nThe ongoing democratization process taking place at\ndifferent rhythms in different countries could fall prey to\nthis situation. It could also lead to social and political\ninstability and give rise to risks to peace and security. It is\nillusory to believe that the negative impact of such an\neconomic situation could be contained within the\nboundaries of developing nations, since the phenomenon of\nglobalization seems to have created its own dynamics and\nknows no boundaries.\nThe destinies of our countries, large and small alike,\nindustrialized or developing, are increasingly interlinked.\nTherefore, it is imperative that collectively we find effective\nsolutions that facilitate the end of the crisis, promote\ngrowth on a global scale and secure a sustainable rhythm of\nsocial and economic development.\nAs a country severely affected by drought and\ndesertification, Cape Verde pays special attention to the\nenvironment.\nThe environmental issues confronting mankind, as well\nas of the relationship between man and nature, make it\nincumbent upon us to act in a swift, efficient and global\nmanner so as to guarantee the preservation of the basic\nconditions that make life possible on Earth. Our primary\ntask should be to find a global strategy that will maintain\nthe balance of our ecosystems and at the same time secure\nthe betterment of living conditions for the world?s\npopulation.\nHowever, this is easier said than done. Cape Verde\nshares the view that, in order for us to confront the problem\nof environmental degradation, we should take a new\napproach to the dynamics of economic and social\ndevelopment, an approach that focuses on the eradication\nof poverty. Until this is done, not much can be achieved\nin this regard, at least not in the developing countries.\nAgainst this background, my Government has been\nenacting various pieces of legislation to bring the issue of\nthe environment into its legal mainstream. However,\nwhatever legislative measures we and other developing\ncountries may enact, in order to reap the expected\nenvironmental benefits, resources should be made\navailable by the international community to allow\ndeveloping nations to build their capacity to implement\ntheir own environmental programmes in a sustained\nmanner.\nThe end of the cold war seemed to have created a\nnew dynamic for the issue of poverty through the Agenda\nfor Development. Awareness of this issue seems to have\nbeen strengthened, since we cannot remain indifferent to\nthe extreme poverty that severely afflicts more than a\nquarter of the planet?s inhabitants. The spirit of solidarity\nthat guided the Copenhagen Summit must today be\nreflected in a gamut of concrete actions aimed at\nsupporting the huge efforts of developing countries in\ntheir struggle against poverty, the creation of conditions\nfor sustainable development and, consequently, the\ngeneral improvement of people?s living conditions.\nCape Verde, within the framework of the\nengagement undertaken at that Summit, has been adopting\nthe necessary measures to combat poverty in the country.\nNevertheless, like other developing nations, especially\nthose on the list of least developed countries, we find that\nour internal efforts will not produce the expected results\nwithout additional measures on the part of the\ninternational community. We believe that the special\nfollow-up meeting to take place in the year 2000 should\nbe the occasion for a thorough assessment of the situation\nand for the launching of concrete action targeted at the\neffective implementation of the engagements undertaken\nat the Copenhagen Conference.\nBy the same token, I cannot but emphasize the issue\nof small island States, which, as is known, have special\nchallenges and vulnerabilities, a global assessment of\nwhich will be made next year, in keeping with the\nBarbados Programme of Action. It is expected that the\ninternational community will commit itself to concrete\nmeasures with a view to implementing the engagements\nundertaken under that Programme, which is of particular\nimportance for the sustained development of the small\nisland States.\n16\n\n\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the international\ncommunity should seize the occasion to make a detailed\nassessment of the global performance in protecting and\nrealizing all the rights of the human person. To this end, an\nassessment of the implementation of the Vienna Declaration\nand Programme of Action over the last five years would\ncontribute much.\nIt should be borne in mind that the protection and\npromotion of all human rights constitutes a major challenge\nto mankind as we approach the next millennium.\nRegrettably, throughout the world, political, ethnic or\nreligious intolerance, as well as armed conflicts, have\nbrought untold misery to millions of people whose\nfundamental rights have been violated, including the\nfundamental right to life. Special emphasis, in this regard,\nshould be put on the right to development, a fundamental\nhuman right which, by its very nature, conditions the degree\nand the modus of realization of the other human rights \u2014\npolitical, civil, social, cultural and economic rights.\nMuch talk has been heard on the issue of human\nrights. It is not enough, however, to proclaim such rights or\nto brag about them without at the same time ensuring the\nconditions, including the economic conditions, for their\neffective implementation, a task that especially requires\naction on the part of the United Nations system and the\ninternational community in general.\nThe people of East Timor are still deprived of their\nfundamental rights, especially the inalienable right to\ndispose of their own destiny. Cape Verde, in keeping with\nthe United Nations principles it has always upheld, once\nagain emphasizes the need for the observance of and\nrespect for the right of self-determination of the East\nTimorese people, and encourages the efforts undertaken by\nthe international community, under the authority of the\nSecretary-General, with a view to protecting and promoting\nhuman rights in that territory, and finding a lasting solution\nthat is acceptable.\nAs we approach the next millennium, our countries are\nfaced with daunting challenges, and the Organization, which\nhas unequivocally scored some successes, should be capable\nof coping with a rejuvenated role, one which should be\nincreasingly more humane and reflecting more solidarity,\naimed at the effective implementation of the lofty ideals\nthat are its foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My delegation also wishes to\nconvey our deep gratitude and appreciation to the\noutgoing President at the fifty-second session of the\nAssembly, His Excellency Hennadiy Udovenko of\nUkraine, who presided with boundless energy, vision and\ncompetence.\nChange is a fact of life in our world. Change covers\nnew paradigms, new systems, new technologies, new\npatterns in international relations and new initiatives\naimed at lasting peace and international security.\nThus we welcomed the wind of change in the area\nof nuclear disarmament when we adopted the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) two\nyears ago. My country was the first to ratify the Treaty.\nBut the more things change, the more they remain the\nsame. Some months ago, India and Pakistan conducted\nnuclear tests. My delegation calls on India and Pakistan\nto reconsider their nuclear pretensions and to become\nparties to the CTBT. We call on all countries to become\nparties to this Treaty and to fully implement the\nprovisions of the Treaty.\nMy delegation would like to see the CTBT improved\nto set a clear time-frame for the elimination of all nuclear\nweapons. As an imperative for meaningful change, my\n24\n\n\ndelegation urges all nuclear-weapon States to destroy all\nstockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons, and in so doing\nrid our world, once and for all, of nuclear weapons.\nMy delegation also calls for meaningful change\nregarding the elimination of all weapons of mass\ndestruction. Let us rid our world of chemical weapons and\nbiological weapons. We call on all nations to become\nparties to the landmines Convention so that we can all act\ncollaboratively and meaningfully to rid our world of\nlandmines as well.\nOver the past three decades, the developing countries\nof the world have waged a desperate struggle for\nfundamental change in international economic relations in\norder to attain economic justice and facilitate economic\ndevelopment and sustained economic growth \u2014 thereby\nlaying the foundation for eradicating the problems of high\nunemployment, hunger, disease and poverty, which ravage\nthe least developed and developing countries.

They should be\ndifferentiated further, as a separate group of disadvantaged\nStates. The work has already started on the determination\nof criteria for such differentiation based on a vulnerability\nindex.\nAmong the members of the United Nations\norganizations, development is measured through the human\ndevelopment index, which takes into account the expansion\nof gross domestic product, real gross domestic product per\ncapita, life expectancy of the population and other\nyardsticks. However, the hurricane that recently struck a\nnumber of islands in the Caribbean, the devastating tidal\nwave in northern Papua New Guinea and extreme drought\nconditions in many countries, including mine, demonstrate\nthe vulnerability of small island States to natural disasters.\nWe also sympathize with China and Bangladesh, which\nhave suffered from extensive and prolonged flooding.\nIn Fiji, the Government right now is providing special\nfood and water relief assistance to more than 54,000\nhouseholds, or more than a quarter of Fiji?s total\npopulation.\nBecause of the drought, we are expecting this year\na 50 per cent reduction in our production of sugar, which\nis our main export, and there is no guarantee for an\nimprovement for next year. Also, because of the drought,\nwe do not have seeds of sufficient quality to allow for a\nquick recovery in the foreseeable future. Such is our\nvulnerability, and no part of the aforementioned index has\nany real relevance to our calamity. Things may have\nchanged, with new names and new systems, but, alas, it\nis the same old story.\nI appeal to the United Nations development support\nsystem to consider special schemes of assistance covering\nnatural disaster situations. There are already examples of\nsuch schemes in the Lom\u00e9 Convention between the\nEuropean Union member countries and the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific (ACP) States.\nThe creation of the World Trade Organization was\nintended to lay the foundation for changes in international\ntrade by ensuring an open, secure, equitable, transparent\nand predictable multilateral trading system. Yet\ndeveloping countries continue to be paid paltry prices for\ntheir primary products; they continue to be denied access,\nunder one pretext or another, to the markets of the\ndeveloped countries; and even the little export trade we\nhave is being taken away, as in the case of Saint Lucia\nand its banana exports to the European Union. Export\ntrade is vital to economic development and sustained\neconomic growth in developing countries. My delegation\ncalls for remedial change in international trade \u2014\nfacilitating better prices for primary products, greater\naccess to the markets of developed countries and the\nretention of special trade arrangements for the essential\nexports of developing countries.\nWe in the developing countries require substantial\nforeign investment capital flows to promote economic\ndevelopment, sustained economic growth and social and\nhuman development. Regrettably, there has been little\nchange in the volume of international capital flows, the\npace of such flows and the direction of such flows.\nWhere flows have taken place, they have been directed to\na handful of developing countries. My delegation calls for\nstrategic change in the area of foreign investment through\nsubstantial, increased and continuous capital flows to\ndeveloping countries.\n25\n\n\nWe in the developing countries require new,\nenvironmentally sound technologies to facilitate and sustain\neconomic development and social and human development.\nThere is a dire need for us to participate in and benefit\nfrom appropriate, environmentally sound technologies. Yet\ndespite our pleas for the cooperation and assistance of the\nindustrialized countries for reciprocal change \u2014 by the\ntransfer of appropriate technologies at an affordable price,\nby assisting us in institutional development and capacity-\nbuilding to accommodate the transfer of such technologies\nand by assisting us with funding, education and training\nprogrammes to facilitate the transfer and stimulate increased\ncooperation at a business-to-business level \u2014 the situation\nhas remained virtually the same.\nSustainable development is critical to small island\ndeveloping States such as mine, for which the paramount\nchallenge is to balance economic and social development\nwith environmental protection. Six years have passed since\nthe first Earth Summit in Rio, and the second summit has\ncome and gone. Little progress has been made in securing\nnew sources of financing for making the transition to\nsustainable development. My delegation calls for\nstimulating change on the issue of sustainable development\nthrough the prompt and full implementation of the\ncommitments and recommendations of the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development.\nThe reform of the United Nations to make it more\nrelevant to today?s world and more responsive to the needs,\naspirations and hopes of the international community in all\naspects of international relations has engaged our attention\nover the years, and more so last year with the presentation\nof the Secretary-General?s reform programme. If the reform\nof the United Nations is to bring about purposeful change,\nthen the Charter of the United Nations should be revised to\nremove the anachronisms contained in it and to make it\nmore relevant to our world today and tomorrow. A\ngeographical reconstruction of regional groups adapted to\nthe geopolitical dimensions of today?s world ought to be\nimplemented. We submit that the current set of regional\ngroups should be increased numerically and reconfigured.\nMy delegation further submits that the membership of all\nUnited Nations organs and organizations should be\ngoverned by the principle of geographic rotation, so that\neach country can enjoy its right as a Member to serve on\nall United Nations bodies. The current system of rotation\nhas resulted in some countries becoming de facto\npermanent members of the United Nations organs and\norganizations.\nThe Security Council is a classic example of things\nremaining the same. Membership on the Council,\npermanent and non-permanent, continues to be\ngeographically inequitable. The system of rotation does\nnot provide all Member countries the opportunity to serve\non the Council, and the system is further aggravated by\nthe number of regional groups and their geographical\nconfiguration. My delegation continues to call for a\nreview of the membership and operations of the Council.\nInternational peace and security has been one of the\nmain pillars of the United Nations. This year marks 50\nyears of United Nations peacekeeping as an instrument\nfor maintaining international peace and security. Yet we\nall are still beset by conflicts of one kind or another, and\nlasting peace and security in our world continues to elude\nus. My country is fully committed to the international\npeacekeeping missions of the United Nations.\nIn fact, this year also marks 20 years of participation\nby my country in United Nations peacekeeping. I should\nlike to take this opportunity to pay homage to our brave\nsons who have made the supreme sacrifice in the service\nof international peace and security.\nBecause of the eminent contribution of international\npeacekeeping to permanent and lasting peace and security\nin our world, we call on all Member countries to settle\ntheir assessments for peacekeeping operations promptly\nand fully. My delegation would like to take this\nopportunity to express to the Secretary-General our\nsincere and deep appreciation for citing Fiji, among other\ncountries, as consistently among the stalwart nations ready\nto contribute troops, police and observers and to take\nother steps to improve overall readiness.\nMy delegation deeply appreciates the meaningful\nchange that has taken place in the scale of assessments of\nMember countries. My country welcomes the new\nassessment rates. But while such a beneficial measure has\ntaken place, the arrears in the annual contributions of\nsome Member countries continue to plague our coffers\nand to place the finances of our organizations and our\nmany and varied international programmes in jeopardy.\nMy delegation calls on all Member countries which are in\narrears in payment to pay those arrears promptly, fully\nand without conditions.\nAt a time when so many changes have taken place\nin our world in the areas of human development and\nhuman rights, the bleak future of the world?s indigenous\npeople has remained the same. My delegation calls on the\n26\n\n\ninternational community to be more responsive to the need\nfor a better future for our indigenous people. In the interest\nof meaningful change, my delegation calls for the speedy\nadoption of the draft Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples, the setting up in our Organization of a\nunit for indigenous peoples? affairs, the granting to the\nindigenous people of the right of self-determination, and the\nestablishment of an international fund to promote and\nfacilitate their survival, development and progress.\nMy delegation is aware that the most pervasive\nviolation of human rights is violence against women, which\ncuts across all boundaries of culture, economic status and\ngeography. In this connection, the Government of the\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands has maintained the\ncommitments entered into at Beijing through the\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and met\nits obligations under the United Nations Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nIn promoting greater participation by women in\neconomic and social development, a major initiative by the\nGovernment will be the launch by our Prime Minister, in\nthe next few days, of its National Plan of Action.\nAddressed in the Plan will be areas such as the\ndevelopment and strengthening of women?s enterprises,\ngender parity at decision-making levels, training, promotion\nand appointments, domestic violence, sexual abuse and\nchild abuse, and review of laws which disadvantage\nwomen.\nOne area of meaningful change in our world has been\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. It enjoys universal\nsupport and almost universal participation, and all States\nbenefit from the stability and certainty that has been\nachieved by the Convention. The work being done with\nrespect to the oceans requires the support of the\ninternational community if the achievements of the\nConvention are to be consolidated and its promise of\nbenefits to the peoples of the world realized.\nSadly, the more things have changed in the Middle\nEast, the more they seem to have remained the same. Peace\nin the Middle East remains as elusive and perpetually\nshifting as the Negev desert. The international community\nmust play a stronger and more decisive role in getting the\npeace process on track, keeping it there and ensuring that\nit moves at a faster rate. We call on all the parties to the\ncrisis to pursue positive and genuine negotiations to effect\nmeaningful change through compromise and achieve a just\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\nMy delegation calls for conciliatory change in\nLebanon with the full implementation of resolution 425\n(1978) in order that Lebanon may fully enjoy its\nterritorial integrity, sovereignty and political\nindependence.\nSimilarly, my delegation believes that a concessional\nchange is necessary to find a solution to the situation in\nKosovo. My delegation calls on the parties to the\ninternecine conflict to enter into constructive dialogue on\na political solution that should include a substantially\ngreater degree of autonomy and meaningful self-\nadministration in the territory.\nThe issue of Taiwan has remained unchanged. China\nand Taiwan contribute significantly to the development of\nthe South Pacific region. My country is committed to a\none-China policy and enjoys very good relations with\nboth China and Taiwan. We therefore warmly welcome\nthe renewed talks between China and Taiwan and hope\nthat they will lead to profitable change on the Taiwan\nissue.\nLikewise, on the Korean peninsula, we urge South\nKorea and North Korea to continue their dialogue to\namicably resolve their common future.\nThe removal of tension and the resolution of\nremaining international disputes in East Asia are vitally\nimportant to the maintenance of peace and security in the\nentire Asia and Pacific region. For the Fiji Islands and\nother small island countries in the South Pacific,\npermanent peace in the wider Asia-Pacific region has a\ndirect bearing on our economic future.\nGiven my country?s commitment to global peace, the\nGovernment of the Republic of the Fiji Islands strongly\ncondemns international terrorism in all its violent forms.\nIt is a scourge, and all States should treat it as such. My\ndelegation urges universal condemnation of such\nindiscriminate acts of violence, and we pledge to\ncooperate with all other members of the General\nAssembly in preventing such acts and in bringing those\nresponsible to justice.\nWe welcome the recent adoption at Rome of the\nstatute of the International Criminal Court, and we\nexpress our gratitude to the Italian Government for\nhosting the conference at which this took place.\nLast but not least, my delegation wishes to inform\nthe Assembly that a new Constitution of Fiji was\n27\n\n\npromulgated on 27 July 1998. Pursuant to the coming into\nforce of the new Constitution, the name of our country has\nbeen changed to the Republic of the Fiji Islands. An\ninnovative feature of the new Constitution is that it makes\nprovision for the formation of a multi-party system of\nGovernment through representation in the Cabinet of all\npolitical parties that secure a certain number of seats in\nParliament.\nThe new Constitution also makes provision for the\nappointment of a Human Rights Commission and a\nConstitutional Offices Commission. The Government of the\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands considers the promulgation of\nthe new Constitution as laying the foundation for\nmeaningful change in our multiracial country. General\nelections under the new Constitution are due to be held next\nyear.\nChange is a paradox in international relations. If we\nare to fashion a new and better international community in\nwhich international democracy is to prevail and in which\nthe development and progress of all nations is to be\nengendered, we, collectively and in collaboration, have to\ninculcate change in the many issues which my delegation\nhas enumerated. We must make meaningful change in our\nworld an international imperative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the delegation of the United Republic of\nTanzania, and on my own behalf, allow me to extend to\nMr. Didier Opertti our sincere congratulations on his\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-third session. To his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, I should like to convey our deep appreciation\nfor the exemplary manner in which he presided over the\nlast session.\nMy delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to\ncommend the Secretary-General for the dedication he has\ndemonstrated in guiding our Organization through one of its\nmost challenging periods, as we seek to reform and\nrevitalize it and to restore its focus on the economic, social\nand development agenda \u2014 the very heart of its mission.\nThe reform of the United Nations is a course we have\nset for ourselves. Indeed, the reform we desire cannot be an\nend in itself; rather, it is a means to better enable our\nOrganization to carry out its mission efficiently and more\neffectively. Therefore, our efforts must be directed not only\nat placing the development problems we face on the global\nagenda, but also at strengthening the concrete contribution\nof the United Nations in the development field and resisting\nany attempts at withdrawal in this area. For it is in the area\nof development that the challenge to the United Nations is\nmost critical, and it is for this reason that we believe the\nOrganization should continue to be involved, and its role be\nstrengthened.\nMy delegation strongly shares the general desire of\nMember States to strengthen the role of the Security\nCouncil, as well as to review its composition. We also\nshare disappointment about the degree of progress we have\nbeen able to achieve so far. However, progress on this\nmatter can only be made after we reach agreement on the\nfundamental principles involved and how we can move\ntogether in the direction of implementing that agreement.\nTanzania, and indeed Africa, has made its position\nclear: that we desire an expanded, representative and\ndemocratized Security Council in which each Member is\ngiven a rightful role to play. Africa, as the largest group,\ndemands and deserves no fewer than two permanent seats\nin an appropriately expanded Council. At the moment, we\nmust place the emphasis on reaching agreement on the\nprinciple and extent of expanding the Council, and not\nelsewhere.\nAn effective United Nations is a matter of as much\ngreat concern to my country as it is to all Member States.\nThe effectiveness of our Organization depends, to a\nconsiderable extent, on its being financially stable. It is\nsad that the financial situation of our Organization has\nbecome increasingly precarious. Cash balances continue\nto be dangerously low, the timing and amount of inflows\ncontinue to be unpredictable, and the Organization is\nunable to meet its commitments on time. In other words,\na bad financial situation has persisted and become\nincreasingly rigid. We are all aware of the fact that this\ndifficult financial situation has been brought about and is\nbeing exacerbated by the non-payment of outstanding\nassessed contributions on the part of some Member\nStates, especially the major contributor, for reasons of\npolitical expediency. We urge them to pay on time, in full\nand without qualification.\nOn 7 August this year, the American embassy in my\ncountry was the target of a terrorist bombing deliberately\nplanned and callously executed to cause maximum\ndamage. The attack in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, claimed\nthe lives of 10 innocent and unsuspecting Tanzanians,\ninjured over 70 people and caused extensive damage to\nproperty. A similar and almost simultaneous bombing of\nthe American embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, brought about\nfar greater loss of life and destruction of property.\nIn the wake of the attack, many friends here sent us\nmessages of condolence and solidarity. Some of them\nextended financial and material support to help us meet\nthe requirements of treating the victims of the bombing,\nas well as to help with the investigations. I would like to\nreiterate the gratitude of the people and Government of\nTanzania to all those Governments, organizations and\nindividuals who have expressed solidarity with us or\nextended material support following that tragic terrorist\nbombing. Of particular mention here are the people and\nGovernment of the United States of America, who\nextended medical support and assisted in the\ninvestigations through the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI).\nTerrorism is a heinous crime against humanity. It is\ncruel, indiscriminate and, above all, wanton and senseless.\nWhatever cause may have prompted the perpetrators to\nresort to it, we do not believe that it is any way\njustifiable. It is the most rational way neither of\n4\n\n\nexpressing one\u2019s indignation, nor of dealing with one\u2019s socalled enemy. Instead, from the moral and political\nstandpoint, acts of terrorism lead to the alienation of the\nperpetrators, incite hatred and so, deservedly, earn them\noutrage and condemnation. Invariably, terrorism reduces the\nnumber of sympathizers and adds to the list of opponents.\nIt is a worthless recourse \u2014 indeed, a misadventure which\ncommon sense demands to be abandoned now.\nThe bombings brought home a number of realities,\nnamely, that terrorism is a global problem and that no\ncountry is safe from its menace. It also reminded us that,\njust as terrorism has a global reach, so must the fight\nagainst it be concerted and global. The world must\ntherefore make it quite clear to the perpetrators of these\nheinous crimes that terrorism will be answered with swift\nand decisive action to bring those responsible to justice and\nthat they will find no solace or refuge anywhere.\nThanks to international cooperation and partnership,\nthe investigations into those terrorist bombings are on\ncourse and arrests have been made. In fact, two people\nhave already appeared in court in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania,\ncharged with committing acts of terrorism and murder,\nthanks to cooperation between Tanzanian investigators, the\nFBI and several other countries and organizations. We need\nto strengthen that cooperation in order to bring all of those\nresponsible to justice and ensure that terrorism is\ncomprehensively dealt with. In this regard, we should\nstrengthen international legal regimes against terrorism.\nThree months ago in June, world leaders met here in\nNew York and addressed the world drug problem, another\ninternational criminal question which deserves global\naction. The objective was to commit themselves to fighting\nthe demand for illicit drugs, the manufacture of\npsychotropic substances and the diversion of precursors\nwithin precise time-frames. The Political Declaration and\nthe Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand\nReduction that world leaders adopted at the end of the\nspecial session were the first agreements ever aimed\nexclusively at examining individual and collective problems\narising from drug abuse. Just like terrorism, drugs are an\ninternational menace which must be dealt with through\nglobal cooperation and partnership.\nOn 12 December this year, we shall be celebrating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human\nRights, which was adopted by the General Assembly on 10\nDecember 1948. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\nis a fitting occasion for all of us to look critically at our\nrecord in the protection and promotion of human rights.\nThis is the time for us to ask ourselves whether our\nadherence to human rights agreements has made any\ndifference to the way we observe human rights. This is\nthe time for us to renew our commitment to all\ninternational instruments to which we are party by\nimplementing the provisions of those agreements.\nI wish I could preface my remarks on the Great\nLakes region on a more positive note than I did last year.\nThe situation in Burundi remains precarious,\nnotwithstanding the holding of the negotiating process\nwithin the framework of the Arusha peace talks. We\ncontinue to receive refugees from Burundi, as the security\nsituation inside the country has not improved appreciably.\nYet, we are encouraged that the parties to the conflict\ncontinue to demonstrate the disposition to a pacific\nsettlement and persist in dialogue. In a couple of weeks,\na further round of negotiations will convene in Arusha,\nunder the facilitation of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, to\nthrash out the details of a settlement and strengthen the\nundertakings already entered into during the last round of\ntalks.\nWe will continue to urge the parties to the conflict\nin Burundi along the path of dialogue in the full\nknowledge that Tanzania and, indeed, the region can only\nhelp. The onus of delivering peace and sustaining it rests\nsquarely and solely on the people that country.\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo is very worrisome indeed. The conflict there, in\nboth its internal and external contexts, threatens to throw\nthat country and the region into prolonged anarchy and\nwar unless it is arrested now. The region, particularly\nwithin the framework of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU), has expended efforts aimed at\nsecuring a ceasefire in order to initiate a political process\nto bring the conflict to a peaceful end. This was the spirit\nof the Victoria Falls and Pretoria summits, as well as of\nthe SADC summit in Mauritius only a couple of weeks\nago. We are also appreciative of the efforts deployed by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan during the Non-Aligned\nsummit in Durban, South Africa, in the search for a\nspeedy end to the hostilities and the beginning of a\nprocess of dialogue and negotiation.\nMy Government believes that anarchy and war in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo are not inevitable.\nThey can be avoided provided all the parties demonstrate\na sense of realism and a willingness to work on a\ncomprehensive settlement based on scrupulous respect for\n5\n\n\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country; the\nprinciple of a peaceful settlement of the conflict; full\nrespect for the rights of all the citizens of that country; and\nthe consideration of the legitimate security concerns of the\nneighbouring countries.\nMy country will therefore continue, within this\nframework and in the context of the mandate given to it by\nthe SADC summit meeting which took place in Mauritius\nrecently, to urge all the parties involved to bring an\nimmediate end to the hostilities and to facilitate the\ncommencement of negotiations aimed at securing an\nunderstanding on the ceasefire and its monitoring, troop\nwithdrawals and the internal dialogue, which is so critical\nto the long-term security, peace, stability and unity of that\ncountry. I urge the international community to support the\nregional efforts now under way to avert catastrophe in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nMy delegation is equally concerned about the EritreaEthiopia border conflict, which has brought these two sister\nrepublics and fraternal peoples into a war which has already\nclaimed many lives and huge damage to property. We\ncontinue to urge the two countries to exercise restraint and\nconsider initiatives, particularly those of the OAU, aimed at\ndiffusing tension and finding a peaceful solution to the\nborder conflict.\nThese two countries, which have endured decades of\nconflict, know the destruction and pain which war can\nengender, and they owe it to themselves and to peace in\nAfrica to ensure that nothing is done to aggravate the\nsituation and reignite military confrontation. We also urge\nthem to give mediation a chance. After all, it is in dialogue\nthat both sides of the argument can be heard, and it is in\ndialogue that mechanisms for enduring peace can be\nnegotiated and put in place.\nThe instability in the Great Lakes area continues to be\nthe source of refugees in the region. Tanzania has hosted\nthousands of them, and it seems we will continue to do so\nbecause of the deterioration of the political situation in\nsome countries. The exercise to repatriate refugees from the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo began in October last\nyear and was proceeding well. By June this year, 48,658\nCongolese refugees had been repatriated. There were\n47,857 remaining, but the repatriation programme was\ngoing well.\nHowever, with the outbreak of civil strife in the\nCongo, the exercise has stalled and new refugees are once\nagain streaming into Tanzania. In the two months of the\nnew conflict in that country, we have already received\nabout 10,000 new refugees. As part of the international\ncommunity and a responsible member of the United\nNations, Tanzania will continue to meet its international\nobligation of hosting these refugees, and about 200,000\nrefugees more from Burundi. But we must confess that\nbecause of various circumstances, our perseverance is\nwearing out and our hospitality should not be considered\nopen-ended.\nWhile appealing for increased support and assistance\nfor our country for hosting refugees, we call upon the\ninternational community to exert great efforts to deal with\nthe root cause of the refugee problem. Many times before\nin this Assembly and other forums, the international\ncommunity has spoken of and committed itself to helping\nthe refugee-producing countries address the root cause of\nthe displacements. I regret that this has remained an\nunfulfilled intention. I always wonder why there has been\nso much talk about it and little is being achieved.\nToday, we see latent reluctance to engage those\ncountries in sustained political dialogue requiring them to\ntake responsibility for their refugee-generating policies.\nWe see greater preparedness to rationalize their actions in\nthe name of humanitarianism. At times the host country\nhas been the object of undue pressure to make more\nconcessions or even of unjustified blame and accusations.\nIt is very frustrating indeed. This is not the way to assist\nrefugee-producing countries to come to terms with their\ninternal problems and spare others the unending burden of\nhosting refugees. We need to emphasize the closure of\nthose factories which produce refugees, as we do meeting\nthe needs of those innocent refugees who are the\nproducts.\nIt is in this light that I ask the Assembly and the\ninternational community to encourage the countries of the\nGreat Lakes to resolve the underlying political conflicts\nof the region and to call for mechanisms for greater\nburden-sharing in a way that will ease strain on the\nresources of the countries which have borne the brunt of\nhosting refugees.\nThe peace process in Angola is, to our utmost regret,\nmoving dangerously towards collapse. While the Lusaka\nProtocol may still be salvaged, we strongly condemn\nUNITA for its blatant violations of both the agreement\nand relevant Security Council resolutions. The people of\nAngola need and deserve the peace they have been\nwaiting for for so long. The international community must\nhold UNITA and its leadership responsible for their\n6\n\n\nfailure to fully implement their obligations under the Peace\nAccords, thus frustrating the successful outcome of the\npeace process. Tanzania will support any efforts by this\nAssembly which will ensure that peace obtains in Angola.\nThe search for a peaceful settlement in Somalia has\nnot borne fruit yet. The country remains divided into\nsectors, each held by a warlord. We support the efforts of\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\nwithin the terms of the Sodore agreement, as well as those\nof the OAU Chairman and Secretary-General, in searching\nfor a solution in Somalia. We support the efforts to hold a\nconsultative meeting to bring together various groups of\npeople, including individuals, businessmen and community\ngroups, in order to get views and proposals in addition to\nthose of political parties.\nAnother long-standing issue is the question of Western\nSahara. We hope that the referendum will go ahead as\nplanned on 7 December of this year. Tanzania calls on the\nUnited Nations to ensure that the preparations are well\nexecuted so that justice will prevail, especially in deciding\nwho should vote in the referendum.\nWe regret that the situation in the Middle East\ncontinues to be characterized by tension and continued\ndenial to the Palestinian people of their right to full selfdetermination and to a homeland of their own, due to the\nrefusal by Israel to honour its obligations towards the peace\nprocess. The Israeli policy of territorial expansion, in utter\nviolation of the letter and spirit of those commitments,\nstands to undermine the prospects for the permanent status\nnegotiations leading to agreement for peace in the area. We\ncall upon the Israeli Government to abandon its\nobstructionist policies and to resume dialogue. In this\nregard, my Government is encouraged by the high-level\nconsultations which are currently taking place between the\nleaders of Palestine and Israel. We hope they will lead to\novercoming the present impasse in the peace process.\nMy delegation has welcomed the recent breakthrough\nin the long-standing conflict between the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya on the one hand, and the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom on the other, over the Lockerbie incident,\nwhich culminated in the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1192 (1998). It remains our fervent hope that\nagreement will be reached soon on the trial arrangements so\nthat the sanctions imposed upon Libya can be quickly\nlifted.\nThe Korean Peninsula remains an area of tension and\nunpredictability. We continue to believe that durable peace\nand eventual unification can be attained only through\ndialogue. We therefore urge the parties and the\ninternational community to support this course.\nWe welcome the agreement reached between the\nGovernments of Portugal and Indonesia to address the\nquestion of East Timor. We urge the two Governments to\nexpand the dialogue they have initiated so that the wishes\nof the East Timorese people can be fulfilled.\nAfrica is faced by a number of devastating conflicts.\nIt accepts the primary responsibility for bringing them to\nan end and for elaborating mechanisms for enduring\npeace in the continent. It is in fulfilment of that\nresponsibility that the OAU has taken a leading role in\nsearching for solutions. This the organization has done in\npartnership with its subregional groups of countries and\norganizations, as was the case with Liberia, Sierra Leone\nand now in Burundi, Somalia, the Comoros and Lesotho,\namong others. My Government continues to believe in the\ncentrality of the OAU in the search for solutions to\nAfrican problems. At the same time, we also believe that\nwhere necessary, the OAU and the African continent\ndeserve the support of the international community and of\nthe United Nations in particular.\nIn this regard, once again wish to pay tribute to the\nSecurity Council for the initiative it took a year ago in\nhaving a regular ministerial debate on Africa, the result of\nwhich was the report of the Secretary-General on the\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\nsustainable development in Africa. We applauded the\nSecretary-General for that report and we do so again\ntoday. We could not agree more with his observation that\n\u201cit is the persistence of poverty that is impeding the\nfull promise of peace for all of Africa\u2019s peoples. The\nalleviation of poverty must be the first aim of our\nefforts. Only then \u2014 only when prosperity and\nopportunity become real \u2014 will every citizen, young\nor old, man or woman, have a genuine and lasting\nstake in a peaceful future for Africa \u2014 politically,\neconomically and socially.\u201d\nIndeed, our illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, has underscored two important facts here. One,\nthat a poor man, a hungry man, has no peace. Two, only\nwhen prosperity and opportunity become real will Africa\ntake its rightful place in the global economy. Africans,\nmore than anyone else, recognize that they bear the\nresponsibility to move towards that noble objective. They\nneed the support of the international community.\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,\nwhich my country is privileged to host, has been working\nunder challenging circumstances. During the past 12 months\nit has made commendable progress. Regrettably, more\nattention has been attracted by the difficulties it has had to\nconfront than what it has achieved. My Government\nremains strongly committed to supporting the Tribunal. We\nare also keenly aware that, just as we have to play our part,\nthe international community must also lend its firm support\nto the Tribunal to enable it to discharge its mandate and\nassist, as quickly as it should, in the healing process in\nRwanda. The recent judgements by the Tribunal constitute\na milestone towards that end. They are a landmark we\nshould welcome and build on.\nThe adoption in Rome of the Statute for the\nInternational Criminal Court is a welcome step towards\nbridging a critical gap in both international criminal law\nand international humanitarian and human rights law. My\ndelegation believes that the establishment of the Court will\nbe a concrete assurance of our profound concern about\nrespect for and protection of the humanity we all share. It\nrepresents an important assurance that individuals, whether\nas leaders or otherwise, will be accountable and therefore\nthat impunity will not go unpunished. Indeed, the\nestablishment of the Court will be a legacy of our\ncommitment to the pursuit of justice, and could well go\ndown as one of the most momentous decisions of the\ntwentieth century.\nIt is in the context of the pursuit of justice that we\nmust, however, mention what in our view is the most\nserious failure of the Rome Conference. At a time when\nsome financial institutions are making, albeit belatedly,\nsome form of reparation to the victims of the Nazi\nHolocaust, it is to be regretted that the attribution of some\nform of criminal responsibility to legal persons is a notion\nconspicuously absent from the Statute. To the extent that\nthis was driven by considerations of corporate interest, it\nspeaks about our lack of real commitment to justice,\nnotwithstanding any measure of concern and grief we may\npretend to extend to victims.\nDisarmament continues to be an important issue for\nmy country. The Treaty of Pelindaba establishing a nuclearweapon-free zone in Africa is testament to the resolve of\nAfrica to pursue the cause of nuclear disarmament. While\nit is easy to take exception to the recent events in South\nAsia, we are keenly aware that international responses\nremain the sole alternative in determining a preferable\ncourse of action. We remain convinced that the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a\nvaluable international instrument for nuclear disarmament.\nIn the end, the only viable alternative for international\npeace continues to be a commitment by all States to a\ntotal and comprehensive nuclear disarmament.\nThe Assembly is meeting against the background of\na deteriorating international economic situation brought\nabout by the persistence of old problems and the\nemergence of new ones. The situation has been\ncompounded by the challenges of adjusting to a rapidly\nliberalizing and globalizing world economy.\nThe majority of humankind resides in developing\ncountries, and Africa is the least developed of the\ncontinents. It is in this regard that my delegation is\nconcerned that after a three-year period of positive\neconomic growth, Africa\u2019s economic performance\nslackened last year, thus demonstrating once again the\nfragility of the recovery process in our region. A\ncombination of factors, including unpredictable weather\nconditions, lack of financial resources and poor\ninfrastructure and technology, continue to adversely affect\nproduction performances and therefore pose a major\nconstraint on efforts towards recovery, growth and\nsustainable development.\nTrade plays a crucial role in the economic\ndevelopment of any country. Despite the slowdown in\nproduction by African countries, the volume of their\nexports has increased over time. In 1997, for example,\nAfrica\u2019s volume of trade increased by 8 per cent, thereby\nraising the continent\u2019s total revenue from trade by 5.9 per\ncent. However, it is sad to point out that despite all its\nefforts, Africa\u2019s contribution to world trade remains very\nsmall and is actually decreasing. Limited access to\nmarkets, high tariffs, low commodity prices and low\noutput deny African countries the benefits of the twin\nprocess of globalization and trade liberalization. This is\nunjust, because many of these countries are painfully\nundertaking major reforms aimed at diversifying their\neconomies. There is therefore an urgent need to address\nthis problem if African countries are to be assisted to\nincrease their participation in global trade. Failure to do\nso would mean that Africa will continue to be\nmarginalized and will stand to benefit little from the\nrecent years\u2019 economic growth and global integration.\nTanzania calls for the establishment of an equitable,\nsecure, non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral\ntrading system that would enhance the trade development\n8\n\n\npossibilities of African countries, and especially of the least\ndeveloped among us.\nThe question of sustainable development of African\ncountries also continues to be seriously affected by the\nheavy debt burden these countries endure. Tanzania is\namong such affected countries, and is currently spending\nalmost one third of its revenue to pay its external debt,\nwhich has now reached a disproportionate rate. My country\nis currently implementing various debt management\nprogrammes to reduce the effects of the debt on\nGovernment operations. Despite the resource constraint, my\nGovernment has set as a top priority the repayment of its\nforeign debt, while continuing to negotiate with our\ncreditors on the possibility of rescheduling and/or cancelling\nsome of its debt.\nTanzania believes that the establishment by the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative is a step in the right\ndirection in this endeavour. However, as we have had\noccasion to state in the past, we are concerned about the\nconditionalities associated with this initiative. A way out\nhas to be found to ensure that the criteria are made more\nobjective so that as many least developed countries as\npossible benefit from this otherwise important initiative.\nWhat could be a more objective criterion for eligibility\nunder the Initiative than poverty itself? In the same manner,\nwe support the call for the holding of an international\nconference on money and finance.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Tanzania notes\nwith regret that poverty levels remain very high, despite the\nobservance of the International Year for the Eradication of\nPoverty two years ago. This is unacceptable, and it is not\nsustainable in the long run.\nWhile those who have more can decide to turn a blind\neye or ignore our calls to look for a solution to this human\ntragedy, it cannot be overemphasized that poverty is the\nroot cause of many problems that cut across the boundaries\nbetween rich and poor. The interconnectedness of the world\nleaves no country insulated from the problems of others.\nIndeed, even if not in the same sense, the recent financial\ncrisis in Asia and its global ramifications serves to illustrate\nthis fact.\nIt has been argued that foreign direct investment is\nmore effective in bringing about development than official\ndevelopment assistance. This could be so, but my\ndelegation is concerned that private capital flows are going\nonly to a few selected countries. This leaves the majority of\nthe poor developing countries little hope of extricating\nthemselves from the poverty trap.\nOfficial development assistance is still an important\nfactor in assisting developing countries in their efforts to\nupgrade infrastructure, which is necessary to attract direct\nforeign investment. It is unrealistic, therefore, to expect\nthis enormous cost to be met by private capital or\ndomestic savings alone. We therefore urge the developed\ncountries to arrest the trend of diminishing official\ndevelopment assistance and fulfil the official development\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product.\nWe would like to thank those partners that have reached\nthe official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent\nof gross national product. Others should emulate the\nexample they have set.\nTanzania attaches great importance to South-South\ncooperation as a means of attaining collective self-reliance\nand complementing international development\ncooperation. In this regard, my country will continue to\nwork very closely with other developing countries for the\nrealization of this goal, for we believe that this is the best\nway for countries of the South to integrate themselves\ninto the global economy.\nMy delegation urges the international donor\ncommunity to extend its support to the South-South\ncooperation arrangements initiated by the developing\ncountries. In particular, countries of the South wish to be\nassisted in developing capacities in science and\ntechnology that are suitable for local conditions.\nWe call on the United Nations system to continue\nassisting countries of the South, and in particular the least\ndeveloped ones, to mobilize the necessary resources to\nenable them to enter the twenty-first century of science\nand technology with confidence.\nBefore concluding my statement, I would like to\nextend our condolences and sympathy to the Government\nand people of the many Caribbean island nations, as well\nas the United States, who have been and continue to be\ndevastated by Hurricane Georges. Our hearts go out\nparticularly to the people of Cuba, the Dominican\nRepublic, Haiti and Puerto Rico, who have suffered the\nmost devastation.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our strong belief in\nand commitment to the United Nations and its aspirations\nand the principles of the Charter. However, we are\nconscious of the fact that the strength, or otherwise, of the\n9\n\n\nUnited Nations will stem from the moral and material\nsupport rendered by its Members. This is the challenge we\nall have to pursue ceaselessly in the interests of\ninternational peace and security and for the equitable\ndevelopment of humanity.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like, before\nbeginning my statement, to express my solidarity with the\npeoples of the Caribbean nations who during the past few\ndays have been victims of hurricane Georges.\nAs well as warmly greeting all representatives, I\nwould like to express my very cordial congratulations to\nMr. Opertti on his election as President of the General\nAssembly for its fifty-third session. This eminent position\nnot only represents well-deserved recognition of his\ncapability and experience, but is also a significant\ndistinction for Latin America.\nAllow me also to express my appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and\nefforts to promote deep reforms of the United Nations\nsystem. Nicaragua gives its total support to these\nimportant initiatives, which are aimed at strengthening\nand promoting the Organization?s role in international\ncooperation for sustainable development.\nWith regard to the Security Council, there are\ngrounds for concern over the postponements and absence\nof concrete proposals from the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council. My\ncountry shares the opinion that resolutions involving\namendments to the Charter must be approved by two\nthirds of the members of the General Assembly.\nThe globalization of all spheres of life and\nliberalization of the economy constitute a new challenge.\nIn this connection, we share the view of the Secretary-\nGeneral, expressed in his annual report, about the need to\nreorient actions and efforts with a new vision that will\nhelp countries carry out a satisfactory transition to the\nglobalized economy, which involves complex and\nsensitive processes.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, the world is\nfacing profound changes that require innovative solutions\nin order for humanity to move in such a direction that\nscience and technology can have a positive effect on the\ndevelopment of countries. The historic transformation we\nare living through has frequently increased the inequalities\nbetween countries; we must therefore plan how to reduce\nthese negative effects.\nIn commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, we reaffirm our\n9\n\n\ncommitment to continue to work with all the means at our\ndisposal to promote and protect human rights. In Nicaragua\nwe are moving ahead with the consolidation of peace and\ndemocracy based on full respect for human rights,\nestablishment of the rule of law, respect for the separation\nof powers and the guarantee of individual liberties. At the\nsame time, we have taken important steps in order to reach\nhigher levels of economic development with social equity.\nMy Government is convinced that in order to reap\nfruits we must plant seeds, human capital being one of the\nbest investments for integrated and sustainable\ndevelopment. We have therefore made it a priority to raise\nlevels of education and extend its reach to all sectors.\nLikewise, we are redirecting our efforts and resources to\nmaintain and improve social programmes for the protection\nof individuals and families in great poverty. This, together\nwith dealing with unemployment, is our priority.\nThe Government?s social policies require healthy and\neffective economic policies that ensure continuity along\nwith the necessary impetus for development. In this\nconnection, the Government?s general objective is to make\nit possible for the private sector to create products and jobs\nwithin a climate of stability, promoted by establishing clear,\nreliable and transparent rules that apply equally to\neveryone, as well as through dialogue and agreement, which\nare the cornerstones of governability and harmony. In this\ncontext, strengthening the integrated system for procuring\nand administering justice is essential. This includes the\nsensitive area of security for individuals and their property.\nThe macroeconomic transformations that we have\nundertaken include significant reforms in the taxation and\nfinancial system, as well as important measures to protect\nthe environment, creating an awareness of the need to\nutilize rationally our natural wealth. These initiatives have\nbeen supported by the international community, and in this\nconnection it is appropriate to recognize the assistance\nreceived from the United Nations Development Programme\nfor many endeavours \u2014 especially its support, in\ncoordination with civil society and non-governmental\norganizations, for the National Commission for Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nNicaragua hopes that at the next Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change, to be held in Buenos Aires in November\nthis year, there will be recognition of the environmental\nprotection work done by the developing countries in\ndesignating important expanses of their territories as\nprotected areas. Likewise, we hope that mechanisms for\nclean development to facilitate the reduction of\ngreenhouse gases will be adopted.\nAt the end of this millennium the battle against the\nproduction, trafficking in and use of drugs continues to be\none of the greatest challenges to humanity. My country\nexpresses its satisfaction at the results achieved during the\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to this\nimportant subject. Similarly, we are participating actively\nin the negotiation and signing of the Inter-American\nConvention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and\nTrafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and\nOther Related Materials, approved on 13 November 1997\nby the Organization of American States.\nWe consider international terrorism and other forms\nof organized crime to be terrible scourges of our societies.\nWe condemn all terrorist acts and reassert our conviction\nthat they require firm and severe responses. We are in\nsolidarity with the victims of these actions and support\nevery initiative to increase international cooperation in\nconfronting these inhuman, cruel and unlawful activities\nthat affect the security of our States.\nWe repeat that the role of my Government is that of\nfacilitator and promoter. We are firm believers in the free\nmarket economy, with a humanistic sensibility and social\njustice. We believe with the same pragmatic conviction in\nglobalization and in the broadest and most active\ninternational relations, without exception.\nGlobalization is not a panacea per se, although it is\nan exceptional opportunity if prudent and realistic\nmeasures are envisaged and taken. These must also be\nimaginative and audacious, without neglecting the\npalliatives that mitigate and cushion the rigours of the\nfirst phases of adjustment and opening up.\nThere is no doubt that globalization will promote\nunity at the international level. Nevertheless, we should\nnot underestimate the whirlwind forces that could cause\nirreparable internal ruptures should the less-favoured\nmajority sectors \u2014 which are precisely those that demand\nour priority attention to their urgent vital needs \u2014 be\nsacrificed to gain time and avoid difficulties. Moreover,\nthe vulnerability to which smaller economies are exposed\nin the face of crisis \u2014 such as that of the financial\nmarkets currently casting a shadow over the world\neconomy \u2014 cannot be avoided.\n\n\n\nIn the first 18 months of my Administration, we have\nhad the highest rate of economic growth in Central\nAmerica: 5 per cent in 1997 and an estimated rate of\nslightly over 6 per cent for the current year. Within these\nindicators, the increase in the agricultural sector is 60 per\ncent. At the same time, we have created 170,000 new\nproductive jobs, with a goal of 500,000 contemplated for\nthe five-year term of 1997-2001 for which I was elected\nPresident. In 1997, we brought inflation down to an annual\nlevel of 7 per cent.\nOur economic policy has received the backing of the\ninternational community, represented by over 40 countries\nand multilateral organizations. After Nicaragua reached an\nagreement with the International Monetary Fund, in\nGeneva, Switzerland, in April of this year, on a new\nprogramme for an enhanced structural adjustment facility\n(ESAF), these supporters won us $1.8 billion over the next\nthree years. Furthermore, upon the completion of the ESAF\nprogramme, we would be forgiven up to 80 per cent of the\nlarge external debt inherited from the past, within the\nconcessionary programme of the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative. These signs appear to indicate\nthat, given the steps we are taking and the enormous\nsacrifices we are making, the time-frame for our becoming\ncreditors to these facilities could be shortened.\nWe have turned to the international community,\ncalling on it from its highest forum to continue to support\nus in our daily and difficult battle to get ahead, leaving\nbehind a dark past of destruction and violence which we\nhave been slowly overcoming with the combined efforts of\nall, guided by a sincere spirit of reconciliation based on\nforgiveness and forgetting. The exhausting legacy of that\npast is the burden of a gigantic foreign debt of\napproximately $12.5 billion and a devastated economy,\nwhich, within the space of a few years, was set back\ndramatically by more than 50 years. We seek understanding\nand help to achieve forgiveness of our stifling external debt\nas soon as possible.\nWe must bear in mind that the United Nations, as a\nsupranational body that coordinates and harmonizes the\nworld?s efforts in many areas, is the most important and\npluralistic forum in which the opinions of all States are\nfreely expressed and the most important decisions taken\nwithin the framework of world politics. Nevertheless, we\nnote once again, with great sadness, the absence of the\nsister Republic of China, which, as we all know, was a\nfounding Member of the United Nations in 1945.\nThe international community is aware that the\nRepublic of China respects the principles that govern the\nUnited Nations Charter, particularly its mission of peace\nand broad and generous international cooperation. The\ndenial of the right of a people to be recognized and\naccorded full and effective participation misrepresents and\ncontradicts the noble spirit of the universal mission of this\nOrganization and constitutes a painful collective violation\nof the human rights of more than 21 million people.\nWe therefore call once again on the nations of the\nworld to reconsider resolution 2758 (XXVI), which so\nunjustly excludes the Republic of China, with a view to\nrestoring its right to participate in all the activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe are certain, Sir, that under your enlightened\nguidance, we will achieve concrete results on the delicate\npoints on our agenda that will undoubtedly help our\npeoples and Governments in a very positive and tangible\nway to achieve the widest and most satisfactory shared\nbenefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I wish to\ncongratulate the President on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession and to express my sincere belief that under his\nleadership this session of the General Assembly will carry\nout successfully the tasks that the international community\nexpects this global forum to deal with.\nI would also like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko\nfor his work and contribution to the successful completion\nof the last session of the General Assembly.\nIn this period of significant global political and\neconomic changes, the world needs a modern and\neffective United Nations that is capable of dealing with\nissues of importance to all of mankind in a proper and\nflexible manner. Slovakia believes that the ongoing\nprocess of reform of the United Nations will contribute\nsubstantively to this goal. It gives its full support to the\nswift implementation of the reform measures initiated by\nthe Secretary-General in his basic report on reform.\nThe Slovak Republic welcomes the proposal to\ndesignate the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly\nas the Millennium Assembly. We expect that the\nMillennium Assembly will provide Member States an\nopportunity to formulate answers to questions about the\nstrategic goals of the United Nations for the next\nmillennium in the field of international peace and security\nand economic cooperation. We assume that the report on\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century\nthat the Secretary-General intends to present to the\nGeneral Assembly in the year 2000 will provide a\nthorough evaluation of the results achieved in specific\nareas of United Nations activities.\nThe Slovak Republic supports a Security Council\nreform that would enhance its representative character, its\nworking methods and the transparency of its work, as\nwell as preserve the Council?s capability to act promptly.\nThe reform should result in an adequate representation of\nindividual regional groups and accommodate a legitimate\nclaim of the Eastern European regional Group and other\nStates to a new non-permanent seat in the Security\nCouncil. Let us keep in mind that the number of members\nof the Eastern European Group has doubled over the past\nfew years.\n22\n\n\nSlovakia supports the efforts to reach a consensus on\nthe reform in the area of United Nations financing,\nfavouring the principle of capacity to pay. In any case,\nmuch of the tension can be solved through the regular\ncontributions by Member States to the relevant United\nNations budgets.\nThe Slovak Republic supports the idea of the\nexclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and is a strong\nadvocate of unconditional and universal observance of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nSlovakia actively participates in the Preparatory Committee\nfor the 2000 sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the\nNPT, and in this context fully supports the universality of\nthe NPT and the CTBT. In March of this year, Slovakia\ncompleted the ratification process of the CTBT. This\nconfirms our active approach in this area.\nWe appreciate the highly qualified and objective\nexpertise of the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA), both in the field of elimination of the nuclear\nmilitary threat and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\nSlovakia fully supported the activities of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency known as programme \u201c93+2\u201d for\nstrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency\nof the safeguards system. I have the honour to inform the\nAssembly that the Board of Governors of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency approved at its session in\nSeptember the additional protocol to the safeguards\nagreement between Slovakia and the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency. Early entry into force of the additional\nprotocol will be a high priority for Slovak authorities.\nSlovakia pays very close attention to the issue of\nlandmines. The ratification of the Ottawa Convention is in\nthe internal legislative process. We believe that the Ottawa\nprocess and the Conference on Disarmament are\ncomplementary. Slovakia \u2014 which has experience in\ndemining devices and technologies, and has capacities in\neducation and training in mine clearance \u2014 would like to\nplay an active role in the process of the total elimination of\nanti-personnel landmines.\nIn the area of biological weapons, the Slovak Republic\nsupports improving the verification system of the Biological\nWeapons Convention, as well as the elimination of the\nillegal transfer of these weapons.\nSlovakia supports the efforts of the United Nations\naimed at conflict resolution through the strengthening of\nUnited Nations capacities in the field of preventive\ndiplomacy, early warning systems and effective use of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. Slovakia?s active\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping operations\nis proof of our continuing commitment. At present,\nSlovakia is participating in three peacekeeping operations,\nand it is prepared to provide troops to other missions as\nwell.\nMy country supports the United Nations efforts to\nstrengthen its capacity for rapid deployment of United\nNations peacekeeping forces, especially in further\ndeveloping the concept of United Nations stand-by\narrangements, as well as a rapidly deployable mission\nheadquarters.\nIn the process of post-conflict peace-building, it is of\nthe utmost importance that a multifunctional approach in\nclose coordination with regional institutions and non-\ngovernmental and humanitarian organizations should be\nstrictly observed.\nOne of the global problems that poses an ever\nincreasing threat to humankind is terrorism. Slovakia has\nalways rejected terrorism and strongly condemns all acts,\nmethods and practices of terrorism as criminal and\nunjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed.\nThe joint efforts of all States are a vital precondition for\nsuccessful fight against this evil.\nThe year 1998 will witness two important human\nrights anniversaries \u2014 the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand the fifth anniversary of the World Conference on\nHuman Rights. Both these events represent an appropriate\nframework and provide the impetus for the further\npromotion, protection and development of human rights\nat the threshold of the twenty-first century.\nIn a year which will mark two important\nanniversaries in the field of human rights, the\nGovernment of the Slovak Republic approved the\ncountry?s accession to the Second Optional Protocol to\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\nwhich I had the honour to sign on 22 September last.\nThe Slovak Republic attaches great importance to\ninternational economic cooperation and to the important\nrole of the Economic and Social Council in this process.\nIn the framework of regional cooperation, Slovakia\nfavours respect for the specific needs of individual\nregions. We welcome, therefore, the activities of the\n23\n\n\nEconomic Commission for Europe aimed at broadening\ncooperation with the private business sector and non-\ngovernmental organizations. Slovakia is interested in a more\nintensive participation in the development programmes of\nthe United Nations specialized institutions and is preparing\nits own concept of development assistance, whose objective\nis to increase Slovakia?s participation in programmes for\ndeveloping countries.\nThe Slovak Republic, as a member of the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) Governing\nCouncil and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, takes an active approach to issues of\nenvironmental protection and sustainable development.\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution\n52/201, the Government of the Slovak Republic offered to\nhost the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity in Bratislava this\nyear. In total 169 parties to the Convention took part in the\nConference under the presidency of the Minister of the\nEnvironment of the Slovak Republic. The successful\noutcome of the Conference reaffirmed the commitment of\nall parties to conserve biological diversity for future\ngenerations. The fact that the Government of the Slovak\nRepublic hosted that Conference confirms the importance\nwe attach to the protection of environment and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nAs an emerging donor country, Slovakia is\ninvestigating ways of providing humanitarian assistance on\na bilateral basis. A very important element in the process of\nhumanitarian assistance, especially in crisis regions, is\nensuring the security of humanitarian personnel, and the\nSlovak Republic is ready to give its support to all United\nNations measures aimed at reinforcing this security.\nThe recent twentieth special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to countering the world drug problem\ntogether was an important milestone in the joint efforts of\nthe international community in the fight against drugs. It is\na great achievement that for the first time in history a\nconsensus was reached between producer and consumer\ncountries on the need to eliminate the threat of drugs\nthrough parallel and considered action in both priority\nareas: decreasing the demand for drugs and decreasing the\nproduction of drugs.\nTo coordinate drug control activities at the regional\nlevel, the Slovak Republic is ready to secure the\nestablishment in Bratislava of a regional United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) office\nfor the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\nWe appreciate that the Diplomatic Conference of\nPlenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International\nCriminal Court in Rome was successfully completed, and\nwe believe that in the foreseeable future a permanent\ncriminal court will be established in order to punish the\nmost serious crimes against humanity and, moreover, to\nprevent them.\nWe believe that progress in the preparation of an\ninternational legal document on the elimination of nuclear\nterrorism will be achieved during this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We also expect further substantial\nprogress in the discussion on the jurisdictional immunity\nof States and State property prepared by the International\nLaw Commission.\nThe United Nations contributes not only to the\nprogressive development of international law and its\ncodification but also \u2014 in particular through its main\njudicial authority, the International Court of Justice \u2014 to\nthe peaceful solution of disputes between States in\naccordance with international law. The Slovak Republic\nhas gained its first experience of ICJ proceedings. It\nwelcomed the Court?s Judgment in the case concerning\nthe Gabc\u02c7'kovo-Nagymaros Project, which confirmed the\nvalidity of the treaty between Slovakia and Hungary\nconcerning the construction and operation of the project\non the Danube. The Slovak Republic is sincerely\ninterested in the implementation of the Judgment, which\nwould be based on an agreement with Hungary reached,\nif necessary, with the further help of the International\nCourt of Justice.\nAn active and effective participation of Slovakia in\nthe United Nations is one of our foreign policy priorities.\nTo achieve this objective, Slovakia meets all its\ncommitments under the United Nations Charter in full and\nis consistently intensifying its engagement in all areas of\nthe United Nations system. The candidature of the Slovak\nRepublic for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council\nfor the term 2000-2001 is the logical result of this\napproach. I should like to stress that my country, which\nbelongs to the group of small and medium-sized States,\nis prepared to be fully responsible for bearing its fair\nshare of the global responsibility connected with\nmembership in the Security Council.\nAs we approach the third millennium, a considerable\npart of humankind is still facing poverty, violence,\n24\n\n\nviolations of human rights and the effects of war. The\nmillions of people on this planet affected look to the\ninternational community, and the United Nations in\nparticular, with great hope. Whether we will succeed in\nreforming the United Nations together into a strong,\npolitically efficient and financially healthy system that will\nbe able to meet the expectations of current and future\ngenerations depends on the will and commitment of all of\nus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident\nthat you will guide this fifty-third session of the General\nAssembly to a successful conclusion.\nMay I also take this opportunity, through you, to\nexpress my delegation\u00e2s sincere appreciation to your\npredecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship\nin facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe would also like to place on record our\nappreciation to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat\nstaff for the care they put into the planning of the affairs\nof our Organization.\nThis is the first occasion on which I have addressed\nthe General Assembly. The year since I was elected\nPrime Minister has been a year of great challenge in\nwhich my Government has been confronted with\nproblems associated with natural disasters and those that\nhave resulted from many years of neglect.\nThe realities of life in the rapidly shrinking world\nmean that a partnership must, in practice, be turned into\nsomething practical and viewed in a much broader global\nperspective as an element of a worldwide partnership in\nmanaging and, where possible, directing change.\nThe point is brought home by a series of natural\ndisasters which have affected Papua New Guinea over the\npast year. First came the drought caused by the El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o\neffect, and then followed frosts, which led to severe food\nshortages in many different parts of the country. Then\ncame the tsunami which completely destroyed villages in\nthe Aitape area of the Sandaun province on the north\ncoast of the mainland, killing more than 2,100 people,\nmainly children and women, and injuring many more. In\nbetween came floods and landslides, which caused death\nand destruction in several places. Meanwhile, people\n11\n\n\naround Rabaul continue to cope with the effects and try to\nrebuild in the aftermath of the 1994 volcanic eruptions.\nThe drought, in particular, showed that people and\nStates throughout the world have to be partners in dealing\nwith the causes of disasters arising from climatic or other\nforms of environmental change. The prompt and generous\nresponse to the series of natural disasters by our neighbours\nand friends in many different countries showed that they\nare truly our partners in dealing with the effects of such\nchanges.\nLike other developing countries, Papua New Guinea\nfaces the challenge of providing its people with\nopportunities to improve both the material standard of\nliving and the quality of life. My Government has had to\naddress these multiple changes while dealing with natural\ndisasters and carrying out a comprehensive programme of\nstructural adjustment.\nIn doing so, we are working hard to make sure that\nprivate initiative contributes to public welfare and national\ndevelopment, as it can and should, by focusing on trimming\nthe public sector so that State resources are used where\nthey can be most effective.\nThe result has been a stable economy with continuing\neconomic growth. It has been achieved and is being\nmaintained despite the negative impact on trade and\ninvestment prospects arising from the economic crisis\naffecting so many of our East Asian neighbours.\nThe lesson we draw from the experience is that the\nworld is truly becoming a global community. The challenge\nwe face is to develop a global partnership \u00e2\u20ac\u201d strong,\nfocused, and determined enough to manage and, where\npossible, to direct change. The lesson has obvious\nimplications for a world in which some countries\nexperience \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aid fatigue\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, while increasing numbers of\npeople elsewhere fall and remain below the poverty line,\nwhere survival itself is the most pressing issue.\nI know that with its small, open economy, my\ncountry\u00e2s development is directly influenced by\ndevelopments in world markets for our products. Currently,\nmy country is suffering from the economic crisis\nexperienced by our major trading partners, in which we are\nforced to undertake significant reform programmes to\nprotect our economy and our people.\nIn this regard, we turn our attention to international\nfinancial institutions to help us restructure our economy.\nUnfortunately, we have had mixed reactions from them.\nSome of them, including the International Monetary Fund\nand the Asian Development Bank, have been very\npositive in their discussions with us, while others appear\nto be slow in responding. This leads me to think that\nsometimes some of these organizations are insensitive and\ndo not appreciate the difficulties and hardships faced by\nour people without their help.\nThis year, despite the El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o drought and other\nnatural disasters that devastated my country, Papua New\nGuinea, we have continued to become more vigilant to\nthese challenges and to take remedial measures.\nNotwithstanding the hardship our economy is\nexperiencing because of the international economic crisis,\nthe value of our currency has consistently been\nrecovering. For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain\nits current reform programmes, it has to secure external\nfinancial support.\nThe challenge is to forge a new global partnership\nfor change \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a partnership in which both developed and\ndeveloping countries join together to address the issues\nthat the global community will face in the twenty-first\ncentury. This partnership will be necessary if the shared\nhopes of humanity for peace, justice and a better way of\nlife are to progress.\nI see my Government\u00e2s foreign policy of partnership\nin the Asia-Pacific as a building block for the global\npartnership on which the future depends. For developing\ncountries in particular, there is really no alternative way.\nIn facing the challenge of improving both the\nmaterial standards of living and the quality of life of our\npeople, we are carrying out comprehensive programmes\nof structural adjustment and changing our focus so that\nboth private and State resources can be directed to social\nwelfare and national development. Despite the negative\neffects of the current global crisis, we are achieving a\nstable economy, stabilizing our currency and attracting\ninvestments.\nWhen my Government came into office in July\n1997, my priority was the resolution of the nine-year-old\nBougainville conflict, which had caused terrible suffering\nand the loss of lives and property. Three factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the\ndesire of the men and especially the women of\nBougainville to end the fighting, my desire for a\nconsensus resolution and the moral and practical support\nof Australia and New Zealand \u00e2\u20ac\u201d led to a meeting in\n12\n\n\nBurnham, New Zealand, in October 1997 where a truce was\nsigned.\nAs an integral part of the truce, my Government\napproached our friends in the region to form an unarmed\nand neutral regional Truce Monitoring Group. The\nGovernment of the Solomon Islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which played a\nvery constructive role in the processes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d New Zealand,\nAustralia, Fiji and Vanuatu provided personnel to the Truce\nMonitoring Group, and its presence helped mutual\nconfidence-building and made people feel safe.\nThe peace monitoring group that took over on 1 May\nthis year continues to provide a positive role in maintaining\nand consolidating peace. In March this year, I met in\nLincoln, New Zealand, with the main Bougainvillean parties\ninvolved in the conflict, and we agreed that a permanent\nand irrevocable ceasefire should take effect from 30 April\n1998. Proceeding on a bipartisan-national basis and in close\nconsultation with all of the major Bougainville parties, I\nagreed that the State would approach the Security Council\nto endorse the Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and\nDevelopment on Bougainville. I also requested that the\nCouncil send a small observer mission to monitor and\nreport on developments.\nAs the internationally recognized representatives of all\nof the people of Papua New Guinea and being proud of\nPapua New Guinea\u00e2s independence and sovereignty, we\nmade these requests with mixed feelings, but with\ndetermination made strong by our faith in the cause of\npeace.\nI am pleased to report that the Security Council\nresponded positively to our request, and, through the efforts\nof other South Pacific Forum missions in New York and\nothers in close cooperation with the Secretary-General, the\nObserver Mission is now on Bougainville, operating side by\nside with the personnel of the peacekeeping mission.\nAs I speak, my Government is making arrangements\nfor a Bougainville restoration Government to take office\nwithin the framework of our Constitution before the end of\nthis year. At the same time, the people and leaders of\nBougainville are performing the traditional ceremonies of\nreconciliation.\nOur partners from Australia, New Zealand, the\nEuropean Union, Japan and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme are providing resources for\nrestoration and development. A number of non-\ngovernmental organizations, including churches, the Red\nCross and Doctors Without Frontiers are also active. My\nGovernment is taking practical steps to strengthen civil\nauthority by training Bougainvillean policemen to work in\nBougainville.\nHaving begun the processes of peace in\nBougainville, we must now do everything we can to make\npeace work through peaceful means. While the peace\nprocess on Bougainville is still fragile, my Government is\nconfident that with the support of all Papua New\nGuineans and of our neighbours and friends in the\ninternational community, it will continue to gain strength.\nAs it gains strength, we expect direct international\ninvolvement to become of less importance, decreasing by\nagreement as mutual confidence and trust consolidates.\nThe Bougainville peace process has shown in a practical\nand constructive manner how people can seek\nreconciliation and forgiveness.\nThe Security Council, together with the Secretary-\nGeneral, have given both moral, and through the Observer\nMission, visible and practical support.\nOn a separate though broadly related matter, Papua\nNew Guinea commends the United Nations on 50 years\nof cooperation in international peacekeeping and reaffirms\nits commitment to these processes. Papua New Guinea\nmakes a resolute commitment to the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. In doing so, we\nrecognize that like any other institution, the United\nNations has limitations. Consistent with our view of the\nUnited Nations as a means of promoting global\ncooperation and partnership to meet the challenges of\nchange in the twenty-first century, Papua New Guinea\ncontinues in its strong belief that its moral values and\norganizations offer hope to humanity.\nConsistent with our commitment to the United\nNations, my Government is actively engaged in bringing\nour national laws, policies and practices into line with the\nimportant declarations and plans of action produced by\nthe United Nations. We give priority to implementing\nUnited Nations declarations and plans of action to\nadvance the rights of women and the elimination of child\nabuse.\nIn common with the other Member countries, we\nbelieve that it is timely to bring the United Nations\nCharter into line with contemporary reality by eliminating\nreferences to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enemy States\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Papua New Guinea strongly\nsupports calls for a new Security Council for the new\nmillennium.\n13\n\n\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we\nendorse the Declaration issued by its thirteenth Summit,\nheld in Durban, South Africa.\nThe Security Council should be reformed and\nexpanded. An effective Security Council should be of a size\nand composition which matches the enhanced role that the\nworld expects it to play in coordinating global approaches\nand actions directed to deal with the issues we will all face\nin the twenty-first century. Consistent with the mutual\nrespect and equity on which partnership must be based,\nPapua New Guinea believes that all permanent members of\nthe Security Council should have similar privileges and\nrights.\nChanging the world from a system of relations\nbetween imperial Powers to a partnership between\nsovereign States through decolonization is among the\nUnited Nations greatest achievements. The process will not\nbe completed, as it must be, until the remaining 17\ndependent territories have exercised their inalienable right\nto self-determination. Neither small size nor remoteness\nshould be allowed to qualify or limit their rights. The\nrecently concluded South Pacific Forum, held in Pohnpei in\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, has confirmed its\nsupport for that right.\nAs one of the States which has always taken a close\ninterest in the situation and in the rights of the indigenous\nKanaks of New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea is pleased\nto note the progress made in implementing the Matignon\nAccords, culminating in the recent Agreement to the\nNoumea Accord.\nThe Noumea Accord will, we believe, provide a sound\nbasis for the future fulfilment of all legitimate political\naspirations. We urge all parties to honour both its letter and\nits spirit. The United Nations should continue to monitor\ndevelopments in New Caledonia until implementation is\ncomplete and self-determination has been achieved.\nMore than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans live in\nrural villages, where they depend directly on the land,\nrivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood. Our national\nConstitution commits us to use and develop the rich variety\nof the country\u00e2s natural resources for the common good and\nthe benefit of future generations. In doing so, it upholds the\nmost up-to-date principles of international environmental\nlaw. The same provisions also provide a sound basis for\ndomestic policy and law-making.\nPapua New Guinea has spoken out strongly and\nworked actively on a wide range of environmental issues.\nConsistent with our record and ongoing commitment, my\nGovernment will shortly be signing and then ratifying the\nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. In line with the\nimportance we attach to such matters, Papua New Guinea\nis party to conventions arising out of the Rio Summit on\nenvironment and development and Agenda 21. My\nGovernment will continue to follow and support the\nfuture work of the Commission, including efforts to\ntranslate and integrate internationally agreed objectives\nand standards into domestic laws and programmes of\naction.\nLike other members of the South Pacific Forum,\nPapua New Guinea is firmly committed to the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island States. We strongly urge its full\nimplementation. Together with other States in the region,\nwe have joined as partners with distant-water-fishing\nnations to develop a programme to manage the\nsustainable use of tuna stocks in the western and central\nPacific.\nThe world\u00e2s leading scientists have concluded that\nthe rise in global temperatures poses serious threats, such\nas sea-level rise and an increase in natural catastrophes,\nsuch as the El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o phenomenon.\nPapua New Guinea, together with the small island\nStates in the Pacific, will continue to stress the urgency\nfor developed countries to take a strong lead in the\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Kyoto Protocol has paved the way for annex I\ncountries to fulfil their commitments under the\nConvention on Climate Change and the Protocol itself.\nWe urge those parties to translate their legally binding\ntargets for the reduction of their emissions into concrete\naction. While it is our firm conviction that there must be\na global approach, we cannot support shifting the burden\nto developing countries as a precondition for the\nratification of the Protocol.\nAt the recent South Pacific Forum meeting, our\nGovernment, together with other heads of the South\nPacific region, confirmed our support for the South\nPacific Environmental Programme and the Forum\nFisheries Agency (FFA) as a key sector. The FFA\nprogramme will ensure the maintenance of sustainable\nfisheries in the region as well as enhance the economic\n14\n\n\nsecurity of coastal States, particularly those economies\nwhich are highly dependent on this one resource.\nThis is the International Year of the Ocean. Papua\nNew Guinea will work actively with other South Pacific\nMissions in New York to commemorate this Year, with\nparticular emphasis on the sustainable use of resources\nderived from the oceans.\nWith its recent share of national disasters, some of\nwhich have taken the ultimate human toll, Papua New\nGuinea is concerned about climate change, rising sea levels\nand the urgent need to reduce carbon and other emissions\nin the atmosphere. Having experienced natural disasters at\nfirst hand, I would say that the greatest challenge for the\nUnited Nations is to strengthen the global community\u00e2s\ncapacity to respond promptly and effectively to natural\ndisasters. I am sure that my friends from China and\nBangladesh, where large areas have recently been\ndevastated by floods, would agree. Papua New Guinea\nstrongly supports the renewal of the International Decade\nfor Natural Disaster Reduction and preparedness and the\nYokohama Strategy adopted in 1993.\nConsistent with our shared commitment to a stable,\npeaceful and environmentally safe world, my Government\nsupports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We support efforts to ban\ntransboundary movements of radioactive and other\nhazardous wastes in and through our region and to ensure\nthat damage arising from nuclear explosions is adequately\ncompensated.\nTogether with our partners in the South Pacific Forum,\nwe recently reaffirmed our determination to maintain the\nSouth Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. We also expressed our\nsupport for the other regional nuclear-free zones, in Africa,\nSouth-East Asia and the Latin American and Caribbean\nregion, and the proposed new initiative in Central and\nSouth Asia. Like people and Governments throughout the\nworld, we in the South Pacific were seriously concerned\nabout the series of nuclear weapons tests conducted by\nIndia and Pakistan. The best course of action would be not\nonly to stop testing now but also to destroy all nuclear\nweapons. Papua New Guinea believes that the same should\napply to all weapons of mass destruction in other parts of\nthe world.\nEncouraged at the positive signs of progress towards\nresolving conflicts and securing peace in several areas of\ntension and concern in Asia and Africa, Papua New Guinea\nnonetheless remains anxious over recent developments\naffecting Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We are heartened by the\nefforts made by the Organization of African Unity to\nrestore peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.\nAlso, we support the initiative of President Nelson\nMandela of South Africa to revive a common vision for\npeace in Africa.\nConsistent with our commitment to peaceful\ndialogue between nations, Papua New Guinea condemns\nthose who employ terrorism against innocent people,\nincluding women and children. Diplomacy is the means\nby which States join together as partners and cooperate in\nbringing about changes to promote peace, development\nand justice for people both in principle and, even more\nimportantly, in practice. It is therefore vital that diplomats\nbe able to live and work safely, free from the threat of\nterrorism, such as that practised against American\ndiplomats in Africa.\nIn this connection, following recent events on our\ncommon border with Indonesia, my Government would\nlike to make clear its strong and consistent recognition of\nthe sovereignty of Indonesia, including Irian Jaya, and the\ncontinuing mutual respect in all aspects of our\nrelationship.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Papua New\nGuinea\u00e2s commitments to the United Nations Charter; to\nthe inalienable rights of the independent territories to self-\ndetermination, noting the Matignon and Noumea accords\nfor the Kanak people of New Caledonia; the declaration\nto advance the rights of women and eliminate child abuse;\nto our determination to maintain global natural disaster\npreparedness; to work actively in commemorating the\nYear of the Ocean; to the ratification of the Kyoto\nProtocol on global warming; and to the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island States.\nPartnership in promoting change is the key to\naddressing the challenges that the world will face in the\ntwenty-first century. I believe the challenge for the\nMember States is to join together to change this\nOrganization for the better so that it will serve as an\neffective basis for partnership, to address and resolve the\nissues that lie ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I have the\nhonour to extend to the President the congratulations of the\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates on his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\nsession. We are confident that his wise leadership and vast\ndiplomatic experience in international affairs will contribute\nto strengthening the role of the Organization in the world\ntoday.\nI also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nUkraine, for the distinguished manner in which he directed\nthe work of the previous session. We also wish to express\nour deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his endeavours to maintain peace, security and\nstability in the world.\nAs we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, the\ninternational community is witnessing radical changes in\ninternational relations, the implications of which are\nreflected in the lives of peoples. The various aspects of\nopenness and globalization embodied in some of those\nchanges have not been comprehensive in their positive\naspects, but have resulted in widely divergent levels of\neconomic and social development among States and have\npromoted the emergence of new patterns of problems that\nrequire radical joint international solutions to contain and\ndeal with them.\nThere is now an increased awareness in the world of\nthe inevitability of renewing and developing the United\nNations as the essential international tool for dealing with\ncurrent world problems and achieving balance, transparency\nand justice in international relations.\nConsequently, we support the positions of the Non-\nAligned Movement and the Group of 77 regarding these\nvital issues, particularly the questions within the purview\nof the General Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil, and the reform of the Security Council and\nenlargement of its membership. We also call for\nstrengthening coordination, cooperation and dialogue\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations in\norder to mobilize and complement joint international\nefforts to deal with many issues on the agenda.\nThe world has seen positive efforts in the area of\ninternational law, the most important of which were\nreflected in the conclusion of a number of international\nconventions. The latest of these efforts was the\nestablishment in Rome of an International Criminal Court,\nwhich we regard as an important step that will contribute\nto supporting the principles of human rights worldwide.\nWe also call for reactivating the role of the International\nCourt of Justice, which is the essential legal instrument\nfor settling disputes between States.\nPolitical events in the world, and particularly in the\nArab Gulf region, have proved that radical solutions to\nregional disputes can only be achieved through peaceful\nmeans and methods based on the principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations and international law. Proceeding\nfrom this belief, and true to those principles, the United\nArab Emirates has adopted a wise policy in its quest for\na peaceful solution to the question of the occupation by\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran of its three islands \u2014\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa \u2014 which form\nan integral part of our national sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity.\nThe continued consolidation by Iran of its illegal\noccupation of those islands and the imposition of a policy\nof fait accompli through numerous military and civilian\nmeasures designed to change their historical, demographic\nand legal characteristics are a source of grave tension and\nconcern in the region. This runs counter to good-\nneighbourly relations, peaceful coexistence and\nconfidence-building, as well as to the Charters of both the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference. Such actions are also incompatible with the\napproaches taken by the members of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil, which call for the settlement of existing disputes\nby peaceful means in order to achieve permanent security\nand stability in the region and strengthen relations and\ncommon interests between the States members of the Gulf\nCooperation Council and Iran.\n22\n\n\nAccordingly, once again from this rostrum we appeal\nto the Government of friendly Iran to demonstrate a serious\npolitical will and accept our genuinely peaceful initiative,\nsupported by all fraternal and friendly States, either to\nengage with us in dialogue and enter into bilateral\nnegotiations that would address the legal and historical\nbackground of this question, not just its formalities, or\naccept resort to the International Court of Justice with a\nview to reaching a just and permanent settlement conducive\nto terminating the Iranian occupation of our three islands.\nOnce again we reaffirm that our call for solving this dispute\npeacefully emanates from the nature of our historical\nrelations with Iran and proceeds from our commitment to\nthe essential principles governing international relations.\nThis is also in the interest of preserving peace, security and\nstability in our region and throughout the world.\nThe United Arab Emirates renews its support for all\npeaceful efforts and endeavours by the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations towards resumption of the activities of\nthe Special Commission in Iraq. But we consider it\nnecessary, in order to avoid any further escalation or\nrenewed tensions in the region, and in the light of the\nimportance of preserving the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq and non-interference in its international\naffairs, to continue upgrading the food-for-oil programme\nand improving its operation in order to meet the\nhumanitarian needs of the fraternal Iraqi people and to\nalleviate its ceaseless suffering. At the same time, we urge\nthe Iraqi Government to fully implement all the relevant\nresolutions of international legitimacy particularly those\nrelating to the release of the prisoners of war and detainees,\ncitizens of sisterly Kuwait and other States, and to complete\nthe restitution of Kuwaiti property so as to ensure the lifting\nof the sanctions imposed on Iraq and to enable it to resume\nits natural role at the regional and international levels.\nThe Middle East peace process is at a dangerous\nstalemate on all its tracks as a result of the adoption by the\nIsraeli Government of a policy of gradual recanting on all\nthe obligations and undertakings it has assumed under this\nprocess. The most dangerous aspect of that policy is that\nGovernment\u2019s resolve to proceed with implementing its\nplans for building more Jewish settlements in the occupied\nPalestinian and other Arab territories, particularly in the city\nof Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan. It daily perpetrates\natrocious and inhuman crimes against the Palestinian and\nother Arab peoples, which constitutes a flagrant violation of\nthe basic principles on which that process and the Fourth\nGeneva Convention of 1949 are based.\nAware of the danger inherent in the continuation of\nthese illegal Israeli acts, we believe there is a need for\neffective action by the international community \u2014 in\nparticular, the co-sponsors of the peace process and the\nEuropean Union \u2014 to bring additional pressure to bear on\nIsrael to force it to comply with its legal obligations and\nto demand that it resume the negotiations, without\npreconditions, on the different tracks of the peace process,\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. We\nalso express our unceasing support for the Palestinian\npeople in their quest for self-determination and their\nlegitimate aspiration to establish their independent State\non their national soil, with Jerusalem as its capital.\nSimilarly, we support the position of the Government of\nLebanon, demanding that Israel implement fully Security\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978), which calls on Israel to\nend unconditionally its military occupation of the south of\nLebanon and its western Bekaa valley without condition.\nThe establishment of a zone free of all kinds of\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and Arab\nGulf regions is a requirement that complements the peace\nprocess and represents an essential factor in the security\nand stability of those regions. Accordingly, the\ninternational community should demand that the\nGovernment of Israel accede to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subject its\nnuclear installations to the control and safeguards regime\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. International\nmeasures which so far have been achieved in the area of\nworld disarmament have not been global in their\ncoverage, especially since we are witnessing an arms race\nand testing of nuclear and other proscribed weapons. Such\ndevelopments will not lead to the settlement of existing\ndisputes between States, but, rather, to an imbalance in\nregional security, as is the case between India and\nPakistan and in other regions.\nWe therefore urge both friendly countries to exercise\nself-restraint, renounce the use of force and resume\ndialogue and negotiations with a view to reducing\ntensions and solving their current disputes peacefully in\na manner that will serve the interests of security and\nstability in that region. We also call upon the nuclear-\nweapon States, and those in possession of such dangerous\nweapons, to reconsider their policies, to refrain from\napplying double standards and to promote the adoption of\nequal measures for confidence-building among States.\nSerious steps must be taken by the United Nations to deal\nwith this shortcoming in a way that contributes to the\ncreation of a peaceful and stable world free from tension\n23\n\n\nand from the threat or use of such prohibited weapons and\ntheir damaging effects on humanity.\nWhile we appreciate the efforts of the United Nations\npeacekeeping forces, in cooperation with the regional\norganizations, to deal with and contain conflicts and civil\nand regional wars in certain parts of the world, we are still\nconcerned about the failure to contain several crises in\nother parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the\nGreat Lakes region, Angola and other hotbeds of tension.\nRecent examples are the situations between Ethiopia and\nEritrea and between Iran and Afghanistan, as well as that\nin Kosovo, where the human rights of Muslims are being\nflagrantly violated by the Yugoslav Serb forces, whose\nactions we strongly condemn as contradicting legally\nbinding international norms and principles. The United\nNations, and the Security Council in particular, must\nassume their responsibilities in putting an end to such\nconflicts and violations and should promote the\nparticipation of regional organizations in finding adequate\npeaceful solutions to those problems. We also call upon the\nparties concerned to cooperate in such efforts by\ndemonstrating the political will necessary to settle their\ndisputes by peaceful means.\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly condemns the\nterrorist acts that were carried out recently in some African\nStates, resulting in heavy losses of lives and property. On\nthe basis of ethical and humanitarian responsibility, the\ninternational community should intensify its efforts to\nprotect civilians and their rights and to confront the\nphenomenon of terrorism, regardless of its origin or form.\nHowever, combating this dangerous phenomenon should not\nbe carried out on a unilateral basis or through\nindiscriminate military revenge, which destroys lives and\nproperty, but through joint international action within the\nframework of the United Nations in order to ensure the\nelimination of all the root causes and manifestations of\nterrorism and thereby preserve the security and stability of\nsocieties and the territorial integrity of States.\nThe world economic and financial environment\ncontinues to undergo numerous challenges which have\nvarying implications for development. Despite the\nliberalization of trade, the open markets and the\nglobalization of the economy that have characterized\ninternational relations, developing countries, representing a\nmajority of the population of this planet, are still facing a\nmultitude of problems especially together with the\nexacerbation of unemployment, illiteracy and poverty, in\naddition to debts and the cost of servicing them, declining\nhumanitarian and development assistance which have\nbecome a heavy burden on many of those States,\nparticularly the least developed countries. As a result,\ntheir development problems have increased, and that in\nturn has led to the creation of a state of instability and\nsocial disintegration.\nRecent economic and financial crises in South-East\nAsia and other regions not only pose challenges to\nsustainable development, but also demonstrate that there\nare clear imbalances in the world monetary, economic and\ntrade systems. Therefore, we call for the development of\nglobal economic and financial strategies to remedy the\nreal causes of this phenomenon in order to achieve\nstability in the world financial, economic and trade\nsystems. This will also require the reform of international\ndevelopment and financial institutions to enable them to\nadapt to the changing economic situation in the world and\neffectively contribute to addressing many of those\nproblems. That in turn will require the initiation of\ncomprehensive and objective North-South dialogue, which\nshould lead to the fulfilment of the goals shared by both\nthe developing and developed countries.\nIn conclusion, I hope that the deliberations of the\nAssembly at this session will succeed in reaching positive\nresolutions that address our concerns as they are reflected\non the agenda for this session for the benefit, prosperity,\nsecurity and stability of our States and peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The confidence placed in you to guide our work\nreflects the international community?s recognition of the\ncontribution of your country, Uruguay, to the defence of the\nideals of the United Nations. Your competence and\nexperience reinforce our conviction that you will conduct\nour work with success. Please be assured of the support and\ncooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Chad in\nthe accomplishment of your task.\nI cannot continue without first expressing all my\ndelegation?s gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y.\nUdovenko of Ukraine, who, during his term of office,\nworked with such dedication, competence and tact on the\nmany pressing issues calling for mankind?s attention.\nI also pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his constant efforts to\nstrengthen the role of our Organization on the\ninternational scene, especially in the quest for\ninternational peace and security. In this context, may he\nrest assured of the renewed support of the Republic of\nChad for the reforms that are needed to make our\nOrganization better able to achieve its goals in the context\nof the rapid changes sweeping the world.\nThe ever growing problems facing humankind \u2014\nincluding, inter alia, civil wars, famine, epidemics and\npandemics, terrorism, and the evils of globalization and\nmondialisation \u2014 are making our United Nations\nincreasingly sought after to solve them. More than ever,\nthe Organization needs the genuine cooperation of each of\nits Members in support of its efforts to ensure\ninternational peace and security, the sine qua non for\neconomic and social development. The ongoing\nparticipation of the Republic of Chad in the work of this\nAssembly; its payment of all its arrears, despite its\nfinancial difficulties; and the presence of elements of the\nChad Armed Forces in the Inter-African Mission to\nMonitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements\n(MISAB) and, later, in the United Nations Mission in the\nCentral African Republic (MINURCA) bear witness to\nour desire to cooperate with our Organization in the\naccomplishment of its noble mission. But this effort\nwould never have been possible had we not first sought\nto stabilize the situation in our own country, which, until\nrecently, was beset by a civil war fuelled by all types of\noutside interference.\n\n\nIn fact, since 1 December 1990, when President Idriss\nDeby came to power, Chad has resolutely followed the path\nof national reconciliation and pluralistic democracy. The\nrule of law has become a tangible reality, based on the\nConstitution adopted by referendum on 31 March 1996,\nwhich was followed by presidential and legislative\nelections. In order to complete the process of\ndemocratization, the Government, together with the\nNational Assembly, is establishing the other institutions\nprovided for in the Constitution.\nIn this respect, I am pleased to point to the adoption\nby my country?s National Assembly, in early 1998, laws on\nthe Supreme Court and the High Court of Justice. The bill\non the Constitutional Council is currently being considered.\nAt its next session, the National Assembly will consider a\nbill on decentralization.\nIn the economic sphere, I would note that the extreme\npoverty in my country is not irreversible, since we have\nexcellent opportunities to emerge from it. This conviction\nhas prompted my Government to take the course of\neconomic and financial reform with the principal goals of\nrestoring the macroeconomic balance, disengaging the State\nfrom public enterprise and promoting the private sector.\nThus, since July 1995, the Government of Chad has\nadopted a medium-term strategy for economic recovery.\nThis is aimed at laying the foundations for sustainable\neconomic and social development.\nIn this framework, a structural adjustment programme\nhas been adopted in order to achieve high and sustained\neconomic growth, reduced external imbalances and\nstrengthened competitiveness. This programme, supported\nby the International Monetary Fund in the framework of a\ntriennial agreement under its Enhanced Structural\nAdjustment Facility, covering the period 1995-1998, has\nalso enjoyed financial assistance from the World Bank and\nother multilateral donors.\nApart from our hopes for agriculture and animal\nhusbandry in the fight against poverty, we rely on the\nimportant mineral and oil resources beneath Chadian soil.\nThe exploitation of our oil is one of my Government?s\npriorities, because with the expected oil revenue, Chad?s\nincome will increase substantially early in the next century,\nnot to mention the fact that the flow of oil investments will\nalso generate important added value for local enterprises.\nIn this respect, we have tirelessly reaffirmed that oil\nincome will be allocated to the fight against poverty and\nwill help to finance health, social and educational materials;\nthe modernization of agriculture and husbandry; and\ninfrastructure and environment. In other words, the entire\npopulation of Chad will benefit from this oil manna.\nIn this respect, we stress the fact that Chad is one of\nthe rare countries of the world that is managing such a\nsensitive endeavour as oil exploitation in all transparency.\nMeetings and seminars with the various sectors of civil\nsociety and open parliamentary debates have been\norganized by the Government in order to explain this\nendeavour in all its aspects.\nDespite the political and economic advances in my\ncountry, we deplore the campaign of lies that is being led\nagainst my Government. Indeed, for some time now,\ndisinformation and untruths have been spread among the\ninternational institutions and some friendly countries\nabout both the oil question and the human rights situation\nin Chad.\nNonetheless, my country has made considerable\nprogress in the area of human rights. We have ratified the\nmain international instruments relating to human rights\nand have suppressed all extraordinary judicial procedures,\nsuch as the court martial established in 1991. To better\nguarantee respect for human rights, we have established\na national commission for human rights, which chooses\nat its own discretion the questions to be considered and\ngoverns its own activities.\nAfter more than three decades of civil war, foreign\ninterference and ruthless dictatorships, Chad, thanks to the\ndetermination of its people, has succeeded in turning the\ndark pages of its history and in making the necessary\ninstitutional reforms for the establishment of a state of\nlaw and pluralist democracy, and it now legitimately\nexpects the international community?s help in fulfilling\nthe fundamental right of the people of Chad to economic\nand social development.\nIn this respect, I solemnly invite friendly countries\nand international institutions, governmental and non-\ngovernmental alike, interested in Chad?s development to\nparticipate extensively in the Geneva IV round table, to\nbe held from 20-22 October 1998, on strategic\ndevelopment options for Chad for 1998-2001.\nOur appeal for the development of our country\nwould be incomplete if we were not to raise a serious\nsubject of concern, the improvement of our environment,\nwhich has been endangered by the approximately 1\nmillion mines that infest a large part of our national\n2\n\n\nterritory and prevent all development activity. In this\nrespect, we reiterate the appeal for international assistance\nmade here by President Idriss Deby at the commemoration\nof the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization and reiterated\nby our delegation at the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly.\nOur concerns about domestic policy in no way divert\nour attention from the international situation. In Africa, we\nare gratified at the progress made in settling conflicts\nthrough negotiation. This applies particularly to Western\nAfrica, under the auspices of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS), particularly in Liberia,\nSierra Leone and, more recently, in Guinea-Bissau.\nThe efforts undertaken in the Central African Republic\nfirst by MISAB and then by MINURCA have yielded\nsatisfactory results. My country is proud to have been a\nparticipant in these efforts since 1996. We are duty-bound\nto work towards consolidating peace, which remains fragile\nin that fraternal neighbouring country. The legislative\nelections will be an important stage in the peace process,\nand the elections therefore call for the full support of the\ninternational community. A premature withdrawal of\nMINURCA, before these elections which are but one stage\nof the process, would endanger the costly efforts made for\npeace. In these troubling times throughout Central Africa,\nwe appeal for much more patience in order to enable the\ninternational community to assist the Central African people\neven farther along the path of national reconciliation and\nsecurity, as the United Nations does everywhere.\nThe strengthening of existing structures for the\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts in\nAfrica must be encouraged and firmly supported by the\ninternational community, regardless of whether it is a\nmatter for the Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa or the United Nations Regional\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, located at\nLom\u00e9, Togo.\nDespite the existence of these mechanisms, hotbeds of\ntension have emerged here and there in Africa, dangerously\nthreatening peace and security on that continent, which\nmore than ever needs peace and security for its economic\nrecovery. Thus, we deplore the persistent situation of war\nin the countries of the Great Lakes region, and particularly\nthe ravages of war in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. It is urgently necessary that genuine efforts be made\nby the international community under the aegis of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), with the cooperation\nof the States of the region, so that the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo can exercise its right to national\nreconciliation, the unity of its sons and daughters, its\nterritorial integrity and national sovereignty. This means\nthe withdrawal of the forces of aggression that occupy the\nentire eastern part of that brotherly country.\nWith respect to Angola, Chad believes that\nMr. Jonas Savimbi is the only party responsible for the\ndeterioration of the situation. We therefore make a\nheartfelt appeal to the international community and the\nSecurity Council to acknowledge the new direction taken\nby UNITA and to provide it the assistance necessary to\npromptly achieve the terms of the Lusaka Protocol.\nIn the Horn of Africa, the armed conflict between\nEthiopia and Eritrea threatens peace in that part of the\ncontinent. The relative calm obtained, thanks to OAU\nmediation, must be observed in order to facilitate\nnegotiations with a view to a peaceful settlement of the\ndispute between those two fraternal countries.\nClose to those two countries, the situation of latent\nwar in Somalia is far from reassuring. In that country,\nwhere the different factions in conflict are sowing terror,\nwar could break out at any time. It is important to make\na concerted effort to reintegrate that country into the\ninternational community.\nThe consequences of these hotbeds of tension\nafflicting the African continent can be measured in the\nnumber of homeless people and refugees moving from\none country to another in search of a land that will\nwelcome them, not to mention the very high number of\ninnocent victims, including maimed and starving\nindividuals.\nHaving recently suffered the horrors of war\nourselves, our country is keenly aware of the value of\npeace and appeals to the collective conscience to bring an\nend to the multiple tragedies affecting innocent African\npopulations.\nThe same challenges confront us in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, where the implementation of the Dayton\nAgreement must be firmly supported so that a lasting\npeace can be established in that part of the world.\nIn Afghanistan, Chad urges the Taliban in power in\nKabul and the opposition coalition to undertake a frank\nand sincere dialogue in order to achieve a lasting peace.\n3\n\n\nIn the Middle East, the hope of peace raised by the\nOslo accords is fading daily because of the stalled Israeli-\nPalestinian talks. We urge all the parties concerned to\nrespect their commitments, as this is the only way to\nachieve a lasting peace in that part of the world. Neither\nviolence nor extremism, much less intransigence, will\nenable the achievement of a just and definitive solution to\nthis crisis which has lasted too long.\nMy country, Chad, noted with satisfaction the end of\nthe bipolar world and the radical change that took place in\nthe international situation. By resuming diplomatic relations\nwith the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Government and\nthe people of Chad had only one consideration: to diversify\nrelations of friendship with cooperation with all the peace-\nand justice-loving countries of the world on the basis of\nequality and solidarity. Thus Chad gave its support to the\nrequest that an examination of General Assembly resolution\n2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 be inscribed on the\nagenda of the fifty-third session, because of the radical\nchanges in the international situation and the coexistence of\ntwo Governments, one on each side of the Straits of\nTaiwan.\nWe are gratified at the progress, however slow, that\nhas been achieved in recent years in the fields of\ndisarmament and the fight against narcotic drugs. However,\nwe denounce the scandalous trade in conventional weapons\nwhich fuel so many conflicts and bring bloodshed to so\nmany parts of the world. We are prepared to support all\nmeasures aimed at combating this scourge.\nFurthermore, and in the face of the globalization and\nuniversalization that is engendering the arrogant\ntriumphalism of the powerful, the international community\nmust rise above the disparities among its members and find\nadequate ways of overcoming the negative impact on a\nfragile international balance of the mutations that are\ncurrently taking place. In so doing, it must give priority to\nconsensus and agreement among its members and reject\nunilateral actions conducted in its name but in disdain for\nthe principles and rules that govern it. Therefore, it is\nurgent that peace- and justice-loving nations speak out to\ndenounce the frequent interferences in the internal affairs of\nStates and take a unanimous stand against the economic\nsanctions that are often ineffective and are unjust and\nfraught with social consequences, as well.\nFor this reason, Chad once again firmly condemns the\nhaste with which unilateral air strikes were made against a\nsimple pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, causing the\nloss of innocent lives in that fraternal neighbouring country.\nIn this respect, Chad reiterates its support to the appeal\nmade from this rostrum by the current Chairman of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to send a fact-\nfinding mission to study the matter.\nAs for the Lockerbie affair, while we support the\nresolution of the latest OAU summit, in Ouagadougou, on\nthis question, Chad is also gratified that the United States\nand Great Britain have agreed that the trial of the two\nsuspects take place in a neutral country. We appeal to\nthose two countries and to the Netherlands to undertake\nnegotiations with Libya, either directly or through the\nmediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nin order to conclude an arrangement for the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1192\n(1998) and thus to establish the modalities for the trial,\nincluding measures of security and guarantees for the\nsuspects. These negotiations are indispensable if this\nquestion is to be truly resolved.\nThat being said, may there be no mistake as to the\nmeaning of our policy. We wholeheartedly condemn\nterrorism in all its forms. The many victims of the recent\nterrorist actions against the United States Embassies at\nNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, as well as the equally tragic\nreactions that have ensued, force us to reaffirm strongly\nthat no end can justify such recourse to an aggressive and\nblind fundamentalism.\nIt is clear that the infinite despair in which millions\nof human beings are submerged cannot be alleviated by\nthe use of force, wherever it may originate. Furthermore,\nthe radical fundamentalism often inveighed against today\nis not the preserve of any specific faith. To attribute it\nlightly to one religion or one people inevitably reduces\nthe scope of the actions undertaken to circumscribe it.\nWe therefore support the plan for the urgent\nconvening of an international conference under United\nNations auspices in order to establish the modalities of an\neffective international cooperation for the total eradication\nof terrorism in all its forms.\nOn another matter which is related to the preceding\nconcerns, we would like to express our deep concern at\nthe present state of international economic relations. It is\nindeed deplorable to see that the process of detente that\nis evident in the international political situation and in the\nglobalization of the economy has in no way modified the\nunequal economic relations, so that the imbalances\nbetween rich and poor States are increasingly glaring. If\ngrowth has continued in the developed countries for\n4\n\n\nalmost fifty years now, the opposite has taken place in the\ndeveloping countries, where growth has stagnated, if not\nregressed. Thus, the eternal problems of indebtedness and\ndeterioration in the terms of trade have been compounded\nby the problem of the constant marginalization of the\ndeveloping countries, in particular those of our African\ncontinent, on international economic circuits.\nIn order to achieve the objective of lasting growth and\ndevelopment in the interests of humankind, we invite the\ninternational community to work for a system based on\nrules that are just, fair and more open; for the progressive\nliberation and elimination of obstacles to trade, in both\ngoods and services; for the rejection of all forms of\nprotectionism; etc. It is therefore urgent that concrete\nmeasures be adopted to make it possible for Africa to\nachieve sustained growth which should lead to real\ndevelopment.\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our complete\nsupport for the United Nations both in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and in the establishment of\na just and equitable international order.\nBut if the United Nations wishes fully to play the role\nit has been given, it must adapt to the realities of the day.\nIt must be credible and its legitimacy must be undeniable.\nThe Security Council in its current form is far from\nenshrining these ideals, for two principal reasons: first, its\ncomposition does not at all reflect the views of the whole\nand especially of the least and the smallest; secondly, it\npursues a policy based on a double standard, which makes\nits decisions increasingly vulnerable.\nGiven this situation, the need for Security Council\nreform is self-evident. Such reform must respond to the\nexpectations of Member States. This means that there must\nbe a recomposition of the Council as well as a review of its\ndecision-making procedures, in particular the right of veto,\nwhich is used and abused. We must reaffirm the position\ntaken by the last Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity: the\nAfrican continent must be equitably represented in that\norgan where the fate of all humanity is at stake. It is\ninconceivable and impossible to accept that an important\nsector of humanity continues to endure the harshness of\ndecisions in which it did not participate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate the\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election and to\nwish him success in discharging his duties. I wish us all a\nconstructive fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\nIn 1995, the United Nations system commemorated its\ngolden anniversary. This year, the United Nations celebrates\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This is a major\naccomplishment for humankind. The Declaration has\ninspired the development of a reliable and effective\ninternational system for the protection of human rights.\nAt the time of the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration, Latvia was under Soviet occupation. The\nSoviet Union did not respect human rights, even though\nit participated in the preparation and adoption of the\nDeclaration. I will mention one example among many\nviolations of human rights: three and a half months after\nthe adoption of the Declaration, the people of Latvia,\nincluding myself, experienced the largest of several\ndeportations. Tens of thousands of people, even elderly\npeople and children, were deported to the gulag. This left\na lasting mark on the collective consciousness of the\npeople of Latvia and significantly altered the demographic\nsituation.\nDuring the period of occupation, the people of\nLatvia were unable to utilize fully the human-rights\nprotection system of the United Nations. That situation\nchanged as Latvia restored its independence. In the seven\nyears since Latvia became a Member of the United\nNations, it has benefitted from the moral and political\nsupport of the largest international organization.\nImmediately after the restoration of independence,\nour nation had to achieve the removal of a foreign\nmilitary force. This process was helped by two General\nAssembly resolutions and the good offices of the\nSecretary-General. I am pleased to announce that less\nthan a month ago the last military installation of the\nRussian Federation in Latvia \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the early-warning radar\nstation in Skrunda \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was closed. This event illustrates\nthat international institutions can constructively assist in\nthe fulfilment of bilateral agreements. Cooperation\n\n\nbetween Latvia and the United Nations has been rich in\naccomplishments. The experience gained in the United\nNations community has helped us in our democratic\ndevelopment.\nAt present, Latvia is paying particular attention to\neconomic and social development. Latvia is experiencing\nhealthy economic growth at present. Latvia has one of the\nhighest rates of growth in gross national product and one of\nthe lowest rates of inflation among European Union\ncandidate States. It has a balanced budget, and expects to\nhave one next year also. This creates justifiable optimism\nthat the process of accession to the European Union will\ncontinue successfully.\nThe development of an integrated society is a national\npriority. This is a complicated task because the Soviet\nregime intentionally created a situation in which Latvians\nalmost became a minority in their own country.\nNevertheless, Latvia is dealing resolutely with this task. By\nthe end of the year the Government will have completed the\nelaboration of a programme for the integration of society.\nThis programme will stimulate the development of a civil\nsociety and provide more opportunities for the learning of\nthe Latvian language. When implemented, the programme\nwill permit all residents of Latvia to participate to an even\ngreater extent than at present in public and civic life.\nAlready Latvia ensures broad opportunities for the\ndevelopment of the culture of various ethnic groups and for\neducation in their mother tongues.\nThis past June, Latvia\u00e2s parliament adopted a far-\nreaching decision about changes in the citizenship law.\nMost of the major political forces support these changes in\nthe citizenship law. Shortly, the people of Latvia will voice\ntheir opinion of these changes in a referendum.\nCooperation with United Nations institutions,\nespecially the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), has enhanced the social and economic welfare of\nLatvia\u00e2s inhabitants. The UNDP has helped our country\nresolve sensitive and important issues of integration. On\nbehalf of the Government of Latvia, I would like to express\ngratitude for the assistance provided by the UNDP in\nenhancing the welfare of Latvia\u00e2s inhabitants. The\nsuccessful cooperation should continue.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights spurs a consideration of Latvia\u00e2s possible\ncontributions to the human-rights protection system. As a\nfirst-time member of the Commission on Human Rights\nbeginning next year, Latvia will support the promotion of\nhuman rights as a priority of the United Nations, and the\nOffice of High Commissioner for Human Rights as the\nprimary institution for that task. Latvia believes that the\npriority role of human rights requires increased funding.\nLatvia has decided to continue to support financially the\nproject for the development of national human rights\ninstitutions.\nOn the country level, I may note the National\nHuman Rights Office which has operated actively in our\ncountry for several years and which is the first institution\nof its kind in Central and Eastern Europe. The Office was\nestablished with the support of the United Nations. Latvia\ndesires to continue this constructive cooperation with the\nUnited Nations. In support of the reform package\nproposed by the Secretary-General, the Government of\nLatvia will establish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153United Nations House\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. By the end\nof the year a building in Riga will be the home of five\ninstitutions of the United Nations system.\nIt is significant that during the golden anniversary of\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration, the United\nNations diplomatic conference in Rome adopted a\ndecision to establish an international criminal court.\nLatvia supports the establishment of an effective court\nand hopes that an overwhelming majority of United\nNations Member States will do likewise.\nThe best protection for human rights is a world in\nwhich peace and security prevail. The bipolar order, with\nits characteristic threats to peace and security, is gone.\nHowever, the world is still unsafe. International terrorism\nand crime are growing, access to weapons of mass\ndestruction is growing, ethnic conflicts exist, and threats\nto the ecology of our planet are mounting.\nIn order to solve these problems, the enhanced\nparticipation of the United Nations, including the Security\nCouncil, is essential. To fulfil its role effectively, the\nSecurity Council must reflect the real balance of the\nworld\u00e2s economic and social power and use skilfully the\nresources available to it. Latvia reiterates its continued\nsupport for an expansion of the Council that would result\nin the equitable representation of small States and all\nregional groups.\nAs I speak from this rostrum, I appreciate the rare\nopportunity to address the shapers of world political\nopinion. We, the leaders of the United Nations Member\nStates, must realize clearly that the highest mission of the\nUnited Nations is service to humankind. The United\nNations should become a universal Organization. It will\n2\n\n\nretain credibility in the eyes of the world only if the results\nof its efforts are clearly evident.\nA prerequisite for this credibility is the ability to\ncondemn and deter those who have violated internationally\naccepted norms of behaviour. The United Nations has\nshown the ability to do this on many occasions. I believe\nthe time has come for world society to evaluate one of the\nmost inhumane regimes of this century \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Soviet\ntotalitarianism. I take this opportunity to call upon\nvictimized peoples to commence a joint effort to evaluate\nits legacy. The people of Latvia have endured the horrors\nof Soviet and Nazi occupations and therefore have the right\nto appeal to world society to do everything in its ability to\navert the future appearance of similar scourges.\n\nWe live in an era when the human mind has created\nmuch that is useful for promoting mutual respect and\nunderstanding in our everyday lives. I hope that the results\nof the fifty-third session of the General Assembly will be\na lasting investment in shaping the United Nations for the\nnext millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti, on behalf of\nthe Government of the Republic of Angola, on his\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are convinced that his experience,\nwisdom and diplomatic skills will help us to achieve the\ngoals we set for this new session.\nAngola is especially pleased by the election of a\nrepresentative from Uruguay, a country that has greatly\ncontributed to the preservation of peace and security in\nthe world, as was recently demonstrated by its\nparticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation\nin Angola.\nI should like to pay tribute to the outgoing President\nfor the manner in which he conducted the work of this\nimportant body during his mandate. And a word of\nappreciation goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his dynamism and for the wisdom he has\ndemonstrated at the helm of our Organization.\nAlmost 10 years have passed since the end of the\nEast-West confrontation. We had hoped that by this time\nthere would have been a greater positive impact on the\ninternational scene, especially regarding peace and\nsecurity, and economic development.\nUnfortunately, in spite of the progress we have\nmade \u2014 particularly in the promotion of democratic\nvalues and in the greater respect for human rights, among\nothers \u2014 we are still witnessing the proliferation of\ninternal armed conflicts, violent border disputes among\nnations, military aggression against independent and\nsovereign States, continued degradation of the\nenvironment, and economic decline with the consequent\nsocial and economic deterioration, especially in\ndeveloping countries. We are also witnessing an increase\n10\n\n\nin transnational organized crime and terrorism, which poses\na serious threat to the stability of all nations.\nThis scenario casts a shadow over the prospects for\nthe rapid implementation of the new political world order\nthat emerged as a result of the end of the cold war, which\nwould bring peace, stability, development and democracy.\nWe still have a long way to go.\nIt is incumbent on the United Nations, given its\nuniversal character and singular role in international\nrelations, to shoulder the main responsibility in the search\nfor solutions to all the problems that have become obstacles\nto achieving peaceful development and the well-being of\nour peoples, and in devising fair and effective formulas that\nmeet the collective interests of its Members.\nThe question of conflict resolution and prevention\nshould be given high priority, for this will ensure the\nalleviation of tension in the world. The urgent creation of\nearly-warning mechanisms will certainly enable the\ninternational community to act in a timely manner to\nprevent the triggering of potential conflicts, thus avoiding\nthe repetition of past mistakes, such as those we have seen\nrecently in Africa.\nIn this connection, Angola shares the views of the\nSecretary-General as expressed in the recommendations in\nhis report (A/52/871) on the prevention of conflict and the\npromotion of sustainable development in Africa, and hopes\nthat the members of the Security Council will turn them\ninto practical action.\nUnited Nations international arms control efforts\nshould not be restricted to weapons of mass destruction. We\nmust urgently focus on the issue of small arms and other\nwar mat\u00e9riel sold to terrorist groups by some producer\ncountries. These supplies have led to an increase in armed\nactions by subversive groups and are an incentive to all\nthose who wish to take power by force. We believe that the\ncreation of special mechanisms for the control of small-\narms exports to armed groups, as well as the imposition of\nrestrictive measures against those States that violate them,\ncould help to stop the proliferation of weapons around the\nworld.\nThe United Nations, in cooperation with regional and\nsubregional organizations, should promote the creation of\ncollective defence and security mechanisms as a means to\nprevent the threat of conflict and guarantee the territorial\nintegrity, independence and sovereignty of States.\nThe United Nations will not be able to face many of\nits challenges unless it can count on the commitment and\nengagement of its Member States. This is especially true\nwith respect to the resolution of its financial crisis and the\nreform of its structures to conform to the new\ninternational reality. We feel encouraged by the reforms\nundertaken by the Secretary-General aimed at turning the\nOrganization into a more dynamic and effective body.\nThe reform process must be thorough and include the\nUnited Nations main bodies, especially the Security\nCouncil. The Council\u2019s current structure is outdated.\nAngola supports eliminating the current geographical\nimbalance in the composition of the Security Council by\nincreasing the number of both permanent and non-\npermanent members to ensure that the main regions of the\nworld are fairly represented.\nThe claim of the African continent to at least two\npermanent seats should be adequately addressed, not only\nbecause the region is not currently represented at all, but\nalso because it is the largest regional group in the United\nNations. Angola also supports the Brazilian claim to a\npermanent seat given the exceptional role the country has\nplayed in United Nations activities in all areas, and\nespecially because it belongs to a region that has no\npermanent members in the Security Council.\nThe Republic of Angola is facing a difficult and\ncritical phase in its history. We cannot yet announce the\nend of the war and the beginning of a new era of\nconsolidation of democracy in Angola. The peace process\nand all related efforts made by both the Angolan\nGovernment and the international community are blocked\ndue to UNITA\u2019s deliberate, systematic non-compliance\nwith the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, the pertinent\nSecurity Council resolutions and Angolan law. Mr. Jonas\nSavimbi has demonstrated his unwillingness to transform\nUNITA into a civilian political party.\nAs Members are aware, the Lusaka Protocol, signed\nby the Government and UNITA in 1994, should have led\nto the end of the internal conflict, which was resumed by\nUNITA after its defeat in the 1992 general elections. But,\nfour years since the agreement came into force the peace\nprocess has yet to be concluded, and, what is even more\ndangerous, it has suffered serious setbacks due to the\nsuccessive obstacles raised by UNITA\u2019s militarist wing,\nled by Mr. Savimbi. UNITA deliberately deceived the\nUnited Nations and the international community when it\ndeclared that it was totally demilitarized. As the Security\nCouncil itself could determine, UNITA continues to\n11\n\n\nmaintain active military units with sophisticated weaponry.\nUNITA has also hindered the process of normalization\nof State administration by refusing to abandon the areas it\nillegally occupies. At the same time, it has initiated a new\nescalation of hostilities throughout the country, unleashing\narmed attacks against local government authorities, the\nnational police and the national armed forces, while also\nengaging in massacres of the civilian population. Hundreds\nof people have been killed, mostly civilians; about a million\nhave been displaced; and UNITA has reoccupied areas\nwhere State administration had already been normalized.\nThe United Nations Blue Helmet units and humanitarian\nconvoys have also been targets of UNITA\u2019s military\nactions, which constitute crimes against humanity, given\ntheir nature and characteristics as well as the coldness and\ncruelty with which they are committed. They are terrorist\ncrimes as defined by international human rights and\nhumanitarian law instruments. The international community\ncannot passively watch these systematic abuses, which flout\ninternational legal and moral values.\nDuring the recent summit in Durban, South Africa, the\nheads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned\nMovement condemned Jonas Savimbi for these systematic\nhuman rights abuses. Similarly, the heads of State or\nGovernment of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) \u2014 well aware of the seriousness of\nthe Angolan situation, which has had terrible repercussions\nfor the whole region \u2014 held Mr. Savimbi solely\nresponsible for the current stalemate in the application of\nthe Lusaka Protocol. Due to Mr. Savimbi\u2019s staunch pursuit\nof war as the only means to attain political power, he is\ncontinuing to reinforce his military wing\u2019s capabilities. This\nbehaviour was declared by SADC to be that of a war\ncriminal. As has been done in some other regions of the\nworld, Mr. Savimbi and perhaps his closest collaborators \u2014\nwho together are responsible for all the war crimes\ncommitted in Angola \u2014 should be made to respond in\ncourt for the heinous crimes they have committed over\nmany years.\nThroughout the peace process, Jonas Savimbi\u2019s stance\nhas revealed a personal strategy aimed at creating\ngeneralized chaos in the country in order to take power by\nforce. The facts are clear: it does not make sense for\nUNITA to resort to armed struggle against a State where\npolitical activity is not restricted and where UNITA\nparticipates in its main political institutions \u2014 namely, the\nGovernment and Parliament. Furthermore, Angola\u2019s armed\nforces include hundreds of UNITA members, including\ngenerals.\nIt is unacceptable to have a political organization\nsuch as UNITA, which is not even subject to international\nlaw, challenging each and everyone, including the\nSecurity Council by blatantly and systematically violating\nits resolutions. UNITA itself is being penalized because\nof one man, Mr. Savimbi, who abuses the good faith of\nhis countrymen who believed in UNITA as a credible\npolitical alternative in the emerging political system of the\nfledgling Angolan democracy.\nFor all those reasons, the Security Council in\nresolution 1127 (1997) tried to separate the wheat from\nthe chaff. In the course of imposing new sanctions against\nUNITA, the Council issued a list of UNITA members\nuniversally considered dangerous elements. This list is\nheaded by Mr. Savimbi, who is thereby forbidden to\nfreely circulate in the world. Only a criminal would\nreceive such a sanction from the international community.\nAlong those lines, the Angolan Government has\nsuspended UNITA members from participation in the\nGovernment. The Government demanded a clarification\nof their position vis-\u00e0-vis the peace process in Angola:\neither they are in favour of peace and democracy, or, like\ntheir leader, they choose war as a means to take political\npower. All those who chose peace have since resumed the\nactivities for which they had been appointed within the\nframework of the Government of Unity and National\nReconciliation. Recently, political leaders and party\ncadres, together with officers from UNITA, made it clear\nthat they did not support war as does Mr. Jonas Savimbi.\nOn 2 August, they issued a political manifesto\ndenouncing Mr. Savimbi\u2019s behaviour and, in an effort to\nrevitalize UNITA, they created a Renovation Committee\nwhich removed Mr. Savimbi from the leadership of the\nparty. The goals defended by the UNITA Renovation\nCommittee in its political manifesto are those of peace\nand the consolidation of democracy. This renovation\nmovement supports the peace accords, national\nreconciliation and the effective transformation of UNITA\ninto a civilian political party, and it has given a new\nbreath of hope for the conclusion of the peace process.\nFor that reason, the Angolan Government has\ndecided to recognize UNITA\u2019s Renovation Committee as\nits only interlocutor and partner in the implementation of\noutstanding tasks in the Lusaka Protocol. The SADC\ncountries have already recognized the Renovation\nCommittee, and we are convinced that the international\ncommunity at large will not hesitate to support and\npromote the efforts of the new UNITA leadership as it\n12\n\n\nassumes its role in the young, multi-party democracy in\nAngola.\nThe Government of Angola does not believe it is\neither prudent or realistic, but rather, dangerous, to yet\nagain give Mr. Savimbi the benefit of the doubt. This\nwould only lead to more false expectations, and we would\nbe wasting much valuable time to take appropriate\nmeasures in this respect.\nIn the light of the new situation in UNITA, the\nAngolan Government feels optimistic and therefore is still\ncommitted to the successful conclusion of the Lusaka\nProtocol. It will, however, continue to take all necessary\nmeasures against those who pursue attempts to disrupt the\npolitical order, so as to guarantee the territorial integrity of\nthe country and the protection of its citizens.\nFrom this rostrum we want to draw the attention of\ncountries, such as the Togolese Republic and Burkina Faso\nto the fact that the Government of Angola will not continue\nto tolerate the support they are providing to UNITA\u2019s\nmilitarist wing led by Mr. Savimbi. This includes facilities\nfor military training for these groups to commit terrorist\nacts in Angola. This is a clear violation of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) Charter, the United Nations charter\nand Security Council resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997)\nand 1173 (1998).\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my\nGovernment\u2019s heartfelt tribute to the efforts and role of the\nUnited Nations in the peace process in Angola, and\nespecially the contribution of the late Matre Blondin Beye,\nformer Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in\nsupport of peace in Angola.\nI would also like to reiterate my Government\u2019s appeal\nto the international community to continue to render\nhumanitarian assistance to the displaced people in Angola\nand to assist in the rehabilitation of social and economic\ninfrastructures.\nAngola is also concerned about events in other areas\naround the world. In the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, the military invasion by foreign forces is a serious\nthreat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that\ncountry. This could also destabilize the central and southern\nregions of the continent. This led some countries, including\nAngola, to consent to the request for military aid by the\nCongolese authorities within the framework of the SADC\nOrgan on Politics, Defence and Security.\nThe recent summit in Victoria Falls of the leaders of\nthe countries involved in the problem is a step in the right\ndirection for the resolution of the crisis. Angola supports\nthe withdrawal of the invading troops and the drafting of\nan agreement that ensures respect by all countries in the\nregion of the independence, territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThis would enable that country\u2019s authorities to begin the\ntask of establishing a broad internal dialogue that should\nlead to general elections in 1999, in accordance with the\ndemocratization programme established by President\nKabila.\nAngola welcomes the reinstatement of the\nlegitimately elected authorities in Sierra Leone and the\ninitiation of the process of the return of the refugees.\nAngola hopes this is the beginning of the normalization\nof the situation in that country.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the signing of a ceasefire\nagreement between the Government and the junta opens\nbroad opportunities for a negotiated end to the conflict.\nWe salute and encourage the efforts being developed by\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries\n(CPLP), where Angola, along with the countries of the\nregion, will continue to contribute to their efforts to foster\nreconciliation between brothers and sisters in Guinea-\nBissau.\nIn Western Sahara, the obstacles placed in the path\nof a peaceful solution have been progressively removed.\nAngola continues to believe that a referendum held on the\nbasis of fairness and justice is the best means for the\npeople in the territory to choose their own destiny. We\nsupport the continuation of United Nations and OAU joint\nefforts.\nWe would also like to call the attention of the\ninternational community to the problem of Somalia.\nAlthough we recognize that the parties to the conflict\nhave the primary responsibility for finding a peaceful\nsolution, we believe this will be possible only with the\nsupport of the United Nations.\nWe regret the lack of significant progress in the\nMiddle East peace process. Angola encourages the parties\nto comply with the commitments made under the Oslo\nagreement. We continue to defend the right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination, and we advocate\na rapid and fair resolution of the issues of the occupied\nArab territories, including Palestine, which should take\ninto account the interests of all the peoples in the region.\n13\n\n\nWe believe that this will ease the tensions in Arab-Israeli\nrelations.\nThe situation in East Timor, a territory with which\nAngola shares linguistic links and a common anti-colonial\nstruggle, has recently seen positive developments as a result\nof the understanding reached between Indonesia and\nPortugal, under the auspices of the United Nations on the\nreduction of the Indonesian military presence in the\nterritory, will contribute to the achievement of a peaceful\nsolution. Angola reaffirms its support for the struggle of the\npeople of East Timor for their right to self-determination.\nThe current world economic situation raises serious\nconcerns, since it contributes directly to the deterioration of\nthe standards of living of millions of human beings,\nespecially those in developing countries. We are concerned\nby the imposition of unilateral restrictions to free trade and\nfinancial and economic cooperation, such as the embargo\nimposed against Cuba. Its victims are the most vulnerable\ngroups in society: women and children. The extraterritorial\nnature of these measures runs counter to international law\nand does not contribute to forging links of friendship\namong peoples.\nWe believe that we urgently need to promote\ninternational economic cooperation based on a partnership\nthat will allow all those that participate in the process to\nshare equitably in its gains. In spite of the implementation\nof endless reforms and structural adjustment programmes,\nas recommended by the International Monetary Fund and\nthe World Bank, the economies of developing countries\ncontinue to make such modest advances that we must\nquestion the real objectives of such reforms.\nWe join with those who have spoken before us in\nreiterating our need to consider establishing a new\ninternational economic order that is more real, more fair\nand more equitable, capable of strengthening the\ninternational financial system and supporting national\nefforts to promote economic development throughout the\nworld.\nIt is not enough to appeal to the understanding of the\ndeveloped countries. We need to be more strongly involved\nin the transformation of the international economic picture.\nThe application of measures that would have an immediate\nimpact, accompanied by well-structured programmes, such\nas the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for\nAfrica, deserve special attention if they are to attain the\nsuccess we expect of them.\nThe Final Declaration of the twelfth summit of non-\naligned countries, recently held in Durban, South Africa,\nalso defines some steps that can be taken to solve the\ncrisis, among which it underscores an increase in South-\nSouth cooperation.\nThis year, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThis occasion should be an incentive to develop effective\ninstruments to promote and protect all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, since non-respect of these rights\nis the main cause of conflict and instability. The\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court will be\na significant step in this direction. The Angolan\nGovernment is sparing no effort to promote, protect and\ndefend all human rights. Were it not for the bellicose\nbehaviour of Mr. Savimbi, Angola would have hosted,\nlate this year, the first ministerial conference of the\nOrganization of African Unity on human and peoples\u2019\nrights in Africa. That initiative was my Government\u2019s\ncontribution to the jubilee of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize the role the United\nNations is playing to promote and protect human rights\nthroughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly, a sure\nguarantee of the success of the fifty-third session. At the\nsame time, I wish to thank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, for his fine job in handling the difficult issues\nthat arose last year.\nOn the broader issues facing the General Assembly in\nthe year to come, Italy associates itself with and supports\nthe statement made on Tuesday by the Foreign Minister of\nAustria on behalf of the European Union.\nFewer than 10 years have gone by since the euphoric\ndays that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall. As our\ndecade began, \u201ca new world order\u201d was on everyone\u2019s lips.\nMany believed that we were at the threshold of a new age\nof stability, freedom and prosperity. In the ensuing years,\nwe have indeed witnessed rapid growth in the world\neconomy, but we have also seen an outbreak of new forms\nof nationalism, ethnic hostilities and acts of aggression.\nOur peoples have grown apprehensive about the future\nas they watch the performance of the stock market, internal\ninstability in various regions of the world, the failure of\nfinancial institutions, the rise and unpredictability of\nterrorism, unchecked waves of immigration, the constant\nflow of refugees and the resurgence of misplaced nuclear\nambitions. In some countries, a few short months of crisis\nwas all it took to wipe out the gains of an entire generation.\nSuch crises shed light on an improper balance\nbetween the power of the market and the power of\ninstitutions. Globalization and liberalization certainly have\ngreat merits. They have forced the national political\nclasses to set public finances in order and to promote\neconomic efficiency. But a global market requires some\nmeasure of global government built on the knowledge that\nthe wealth of single States cannot be separated from the\nwelfare of the international community, a government\nwhose strength rests on the democracy of institutions. As\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan underlined in his speech,\nglobalization requires good government.\nThis is why we urgently need to strengthen\ninternational leadership. The institutions are still not\nstrong enough to provide such leadership, restore\nconfidence, introduce change, stabilize the global\neconomy, guarantee growth and protect the most\nvulnerable of us in the race towards development.\nTechnology, communications and the market are\nprogressing at a much faster pace than politics and\ninstitutions, thus creating a widening gap.\nIn the final years of this century, our challenge is to\nstrengthen institutions and their capacity to coordinate the\naction of Governments. Globalization has impacts on\nideologies and behaviour, societies and institutions. The\nopening of markets to competition must be accompanied\nby reaffirmed cooperation among the largest possible\nnumber of States. The burden of responsibility falls on\nthe shoulders of the stronger nations, particularly those of\nthe G-7. They have a duty to show solidarity,\ntransforming their privileges into benefits for all\nhumanity.\nThe system of international institutions has the\nUnited Nations as its paramount and most authoritative\nbenchmark. The United Nations must be the driving force\nbehind a review of the network of interdependence. Like\nindustrialization in its early days, globalization produces\nboth great progress and dangerous imbalances. Thus, it\nrequires governance. No one country can govern it,\nhowever great its political, economic and military power.\nOur century is drawing to a close with a revitalization of\ninstitutions upon which we can build the three pillars of\nstability: prosperity, security and respect for fundamental\nfreedoms.\nThe first pillar of stability is governance of the\neconomy to prevent crises from degenerating into\ncatastrophes. The time has come to perfect the rules of\nconduct that guide the development of the global market.\n19\n\n\nWhile these rules are imperfect and not always respected,\nwe must assert the conviction that it is important and\nappropriate to observe them. This is the secret of their\nsuccess. It is up to the economically stronger countries to\nguarantee continuity in the development of the market.\nThey must be buyers, lenders and the final guarantors if we\nare to instil confidence and forestall the threat of a global\nrecession. The forces that drive the global economy are the\nsame as those that uphold the fundamental freedoms: the\ncirculation of information and ideas; open borders and\nsocieties; the rule of law and individual rights. The\nchallenges facing the economy are the same as those facing\nfreedom.\nAt times, the markets are driven by a short-term logic\nthat privileges the earnings of today over the growth of\ntomorrow. They conduct constant but instant referendums.\nThe stock market does not always move at the same pace\nas the economy and society. Relentless technological\nprogress can lead to the exclusion of many from the world\nof employment. Recent major economic and financial crises\nshow that the market does not always grow when the State\nshrinks. Rather than enhancing freedom, sometimes it only\nincreases the power of the strongest. It is a dangerous\nillusion to think the economic sphere can be unhinged from\nthe political system, the social context and the history of\nnations. There can be no healthy economy without a strong\nState, without the rule of law, without social cohesiveness\nand protections \u2014 in other words, without respect for\npeoples or awareness of their history.\nThe market\u2019s supporters should not turn into the\nstandard bearers for a new fundamentalism. The\ninternational financial institutions must know how to couple\ntheory and practice, how to avoid strategies that damage\nsociety and destabilize the political system for the sake of\ndefending the market. They must initiate policies and\nreforms that minimize moral hazards in their rescue\noperations. They must look at society as a whole and not\njust at its financial dimensions. Otherwise, some will rebel\nagainst or flee the market.\nThe United Nations and the international community\ncan rely on the new cohesiveness of the European Union.\nThe European currency, the Euro, demands new\nresponsibilities at the international level as a repository of\nvalue and as an investment and reserve currency. It will\nallow the Union to project abroad standards that it would\nnot otherwise be able to preserve, such as stability,\ncompetition and social solidarity. The European Union has\nno intention of hiding behind the shield of its currency. It\nhas no illusions of being an oasis of prosperity sheltered\nfrom the tempests of the world.\nThe politicians of Europe are the first to have\nrethought the limits of national sovereignty. Today, the\nEuropean Union, in the wake of the single currency, is\nabout to become a political subject, and to participate as\nsuch in world leadership, to correct the fragility of the\ncomplex systems that govern the world. It is not enough\nto have strong national powers. For the European Union,\ntoo, the time has come to be a \u201cleading nation\u201d. The time\nhas come to further enhance the rules that have allowed\nus to unite the continent, banishing war within our\nborders.\nTo the South, Europe is facing massive waves of\nimmigration. Europe is well aware of the needs that drive\nto its shores so many people trying to escape from\nsuffocating demographic trends. Europe knows that the\nonly solution is an ambitious policy of solidarity and\ndevelopment. Otherwise, like King Canute, it would be\ntrying to hold back the sea with a wave of its hand.\nOur cooperation policies must be revitalized to help\nclose the gap between North and South. The Economic\nand Social Council, whose presidency will be assumed by\nItaly at the start of the coming year, can be instrumental\nin eradicating poverty and harmonizing the differences\nbetween and the needs of the two hemispheres.\nRenewed institutions will also have to manage the\nsecond pillar of stability: security. Here, too, the United\nNations must play a central role. I refer not only to its\ntraditional role of direct involvement in peacekeeping\noperations. Italy, I would underline, continues to provide\na strong logistic base, as well as men and resources, for\nsuch missions and has long proposed ways to make these\noperations more efficient and effective.\nI refer also to the novelty of the future: growing\nrelations with other institutions, including the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to which the\ntransatlantic community entrusts its defence. The Atlantic\nAlliance is redefining its strategies, missions and\nmembership, but it is also rethinking its relations with the\nUnited Nations in a new spirit. It is looking to the United\nNations for additional legitimacy to broaden the scope of\nits mission. This is another crucial aspect of the system of\ninstitutions that can guarantee peace and stability and on\nwhich we must build our future.\n20\n\n\nPeace is also jeopardized by resurgent temptations to\nbrandish nuclear weapons in an effort to restore regional\nbalances, enhance national prestige and consolidate national\nunity. While such goals can be in themselves legitimate,\nthey become totally illusory if entrusted to the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, instruments that threaten\nthe very right to life. In the framework of institutional\nstrengthening, we must, as a matter of priority, root out\nsenseless ambitions that rely on lethal weapons. We must\naim instead to complete the non-proliferation regime and\nmake it more effective and more universal.\nSecurity is jeopardized by a breed of terrorism that has\nbecome more and more irrational, threatening fragile peace\nprocesses, privatizing terror and directing its hatred mostly,\nbut not exclusively, against the Western world and the\nvalues it represents. We must therefore redouble our\ncommon efforts to fight this scourge.\nIndividual rights are the third component of\ninstitutional strengthening, along with prosperity and\nsecurity. The market and fundamental freedoms, as we\nincreasingly discover, are two sides of the same coin. But\nhuman rights are likely to remain abstract or illusory if the\nUnited Nations cannot enforce them to the benefit of all\nindividuals and, if necessary, also against their\nGovernments.\nThe international community, and all of us\nindividually, must deepen our commitment to safeguard\nthese rights. The measure of our civilization is the\nprotection we afford to the weakest and most vulnerable\nsocial groups. I am thinking first of children who are\nvictims of atrocities whose true dimensions the media is\nonly now beginning to expose.\nThe Rome Statute to establish the International\nCriminal Court represents what is probably the greatest\ninstitutional advancement since the San Francisco Charter.\nIn this field, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration\nof Human Rights, it confers certainty and universality on\nthe Charter\u2019s system of values. But here, too, we must\ncomplete our journey. Therefore, I urge those countries that\nhave not yet done so \u2014 and they are the majority \u2014 to\nsign the Statute and to start to move towards prompt\nratification.\nThe core of every reform touches on the Security\nCouncil. It is not enough to strengthen institutions: we must\nmake them more democratic and representative. And it is\non the concepts of democracy and representation that the\ndebate over the future of the Security Council pivots.\nSignificant progress has been made in recent months\nin identifying measures aimed at improving the\ntransparency and the working methods of the Security\nCouncil: greater openness of informal consultations; more\ninvolvement of countries that contribute troops to\npeacekeeping operations and multilateral forces; more\nprompt and detailed briefings on the Council\u2019s activities\nby the President-in-office; and ready availability of texts\nand documents being examined by the Council.\nBut the stalemate continues on the issue of enlarging\nthe Council. The Italian Government will be willing to\nsupport any reasonable formula, provided that it does not\nprejudice the eventual establishment of a common\nEuropean seat on the Council, distance Italy from the\nother principal industrial countries or increase the number\nof countries that are \u201cmore equal\u201d than others,\ntransforming the majority of Member States from\nprotagonists into mere spectators.\nThe essential problem is one of principles and\ncriteria. Italy has made and will continue to make an\nactive contribution to this question that is of fundamental\nimportance to international peace and stability. It will\ncontinue to fight for a more democratic, efficient and\ngeographically representative Security Council. No one\nshould feel excluded. Every country, no matter how large\nor small, has a contribution to make, an experience to\nshare.\nGiven the current stalemate over increasing the\nnumber of permanent members, we wonder whether it\nwould not make more sense to concentrate for the time\nbeing only on an increase in non-permanent seats. The\nsolution of increasing the number of elective seats for\nevery regional group would make it easier for all Member\nStates to have access to the Security Council. After all,\nthis is the same solution that was adopted in 1963, when\nthe only previous enlargement of the Council took place.\nAs to the method we should follow to get there, we\nbelieve that on a matter of such crucial importance it is\nessential that any decision with Charter amendment\nimplications should be adopted by a majority of two\nthirds of all Member States, as prescribed by Article 108\nof the Charter.\nThese are some of our suggestions for the \u201cquiet\nrevolution\u201d of the United Nations, to which Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan has dedicated such passion. We are\ngrateful to him for his efforts.\n21\n\n\nThe century that is about to end has taught that there\nare no definitive and total solutions. Although the\ninstitutions are imperfect, they are flexible instruments. It\nis our high duty to improve them so that they can become\nthe visible hand of stability, together with the invisible hand\nof the market. Institutions are the only truly indispensable\npower.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like, Mr. President,\nto extend to you our very warm congratulations on your\nelection to lead the business of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-third session. Your election bears testimony to the\nvery high esteem in which we hold you and your country.\nYou can count on our unstinting support and cooperation\nduring the year that lies ahead. Through you, Sir, permit\nme also to salute your very worthy predecessor, Mr.\nHennadiy Udovenko, the former Foreign Minister of\nUkraine, for the illustrious manner in which he led the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session.\nIn your address at the opening of this session,\nMr. President, you challenged us to focus our attention on\nthe major issues of our time. The list of issues that you\nprovided was comprehensive, but I wish here to highlight\nonly some of them \u2014 without passing judgment on their\nrelative worth.\nThe Secretary-General has submitted a report on\ncauses of conflict in Africa at the request, last year, of the\nSecurity Council. It is an excellent report, for which the\nSecretary-General should be commended. The recent\nevents in Lesotho, to a large measure, fit in with the\nSecretary-General?s diagnosis. Nothing could be closer to\nthe truth than the Secretary-General?s observation that\n\u201cWhere there is insufficient accountability of\nleaders, lack of transparency in regimes, inadequate\nchecks and balances, non-adherence to the rule of\nlaw, absence of peaceful means to change or replace\nleadership, or lack of respect for human rights,\npolitical control becomes excessively important, and\nthe stakes become dangerously high\u201d. (A/52/871,\npara. 12)\nOur recent experience in Lesotho is that instability is\nlikely to arise even when Governments are deeply\nconscious of the need to abide by those prescriptions, if\nother political players are not similarly committed to\nthem.\nOn 23 May 1998, a general election was held in\nLesotho under the management of an Independent\nElectoral Commission established with the full\ncooperation of all political parties. The Commission, a\nnew institution in the history of Lesotho, was without\nprevious experience. The elections were observed by 400\nlocal and 150 international observers, including observers\nfrom the United Nations, all of whom declared them free\nand fair. Soon afterwards, however, three of the 12\nopposition parties alleged that the Lesotho Congress for\nDemocracy had won through fraud. Vice-President Thabo\nMbeki of South Africa attempted to mediate in this\ndispute, and all the parties agreed to an audit of the\n9\n\n\nelection results, conducted by the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), in order to determine\nthe existence or otherwise of fraud. The Commission of\nInvestigation, which came to be known as the Langa\nCommission after its Chairman, Justice Pius Langa of South\nAfrica, found that, while there had been administrative\nirregularities, there had been no fraud and the elections\ncould not be said not to represent the will of the electorate.\nBut even in the absence of fraud, the opposition\nparties still insisted on the resignation of the Government,\nthe dissolution of Parliament and the establishment by the\nKing of a government of national unity in which all the\nmajor parties would be equally represented. In an attempt\nto achieve this, the opposition parties perpetrated\nlawlessness, which resulted in an army mutiny, the forced\nand illegal dismissal of the command structure by junior\nofficers, and open support by those junior officers for the\nopposition-led civil unrest in preparation for an illegal\ntakeover of the Government.\nIt was in this state of virtual coup d?\u00e9tat that the\nLesotho Prime Minister appealed to the Presidents of\nBotswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for\nmilitary assistance to restore law and order and to enforce\ndiscipline in the Lesotho army. The responsibility was\nshouldered by the SADC member States Botswana and\nSouth Africa on behalf of the entire SADC. While these\nSADC troops were busy neutralizing the army mutiny and\nthe virtual coup, the supporters of opposition parties\nembarked on a campaign of arson and looting in the central\nbusiness district of the capital, Maseru, which later spread\nto other towns of the country.\nAlthough the full extent of the damage to business\ninfrastructure is not yet known with certainty, preliminary\nestimates put it at above $200 million. For a small least\ndeveloped country like Lesotho, such an amount is a heavy\nburden on an already fragile economy. The Government of\nLesotho therefore appeals to the international community\nfor assistance in rebuilding the infrastructure that has been\nso wantonly destroyed.\nWe have already made contacts with the World Bank\nfor a more precise assessment of our needs in this regard,\nand once these are known we shall be making a more\nfocused appeal. Above and beyond the assistance with\nphysical reconstruction, it is quite clear that the type of\nassistance which the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and some bilateral donors were giving\nto reorient the minds of our army has not yet had a lasting\nimpact. Lesotho has had a sad history of an army that was\ndeliberately filled with supporters of one political party\nwhen that party was in power for over 20 years. As a\nconsequence, our army has had great difficulty in\nsubmitting to the authority of a new master. Recent\nevents have underscored the urgent need to overhaul the\nLesotho army, as was done under international\nsupervision in Haiti.\nFurthermore, all political parties need to submit\nthemselves to the discipline and responsibilities that are\ndemanded of them as actors in the democratic system.\nThis includes the acceptance of defeat in general\nelections. Otherwise, those politicians who deliberately\nundermine the democratic culture should be exposed and\nofficially branded by the international community as\ncriminals, as the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) has done with Savimbi in Angola.\nSince 1993, Lesotho has been embarked on a\nprogramme of entrenching democracy, the rule of law and\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The\ncurrent crisis has amply demonstrated how difficult it is\nto make people whose only preoccupation is the\nachievement of personal political power participate in this\nprocess.\nThe Government of Lesotho is grateful for the\nsupport of the countries of SADC in once again reversing\na coup in Lesotho. SADC has given practical expression\nto what has become an all-Africa commitment to the\nabhorrence of military overthrow of legitimate\nGovernments, such as occurred recently in Sierra Leone\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe extent of recent lawlessness in Lesotho has\nunderscored the need to control the illicit possession of\nsmall arms and light weapons. In Lesotho recently, young\npeople, many of them in their teens, were able to\nintimidate law-abiding citizens with guns and to force\nthem to surrender Government property and to evacuate\nGovernment offices and private industrial enterprises.\nSmall arms and light weapons have become so\ncommonplace that they have encouraged habitual recourse\nto violence, thus threatening the cohesion and well-being\nof many societies. These low-tech, inexpensive and easy\nto use weapons \u2014 numbering hundreds of millions \u2014\ncause as much as 90 per cent of the deaths in\ncontemporary conflicts. Their proliferation contributes to\nviolence, loss of life and property, social instability, the\ndisruption of economic development and the threat to\ndemocratic governance.\n10\n\n\nDuring the cold war, arms control and disarmament\nefforts focused exclusively on major weapons systems, such\nas tanks, jet fighters and nuclear weapons. Although this\nhas begun to change in recent years, there are still no\ninternational standards regarding small arms. Their\nproduction, trade and possession remain essentially\nunmonitored and unregulated. Lesotho therefore strongly\nsupports current efforts to find an international solution to\nthese problems posed by the unregulated proliferation of\nillicit small arms and light weapons.\nThe Government of Lesotho is understandably\ndisappointed that its efforts to build and consolidate a\nculture of democratic governance seem to have suffered a\nsetback, especially this year, when we are celebrating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. However, Lesotho will not be deflected from the\npath it has chosen of moving forward to truly democratic\ngovernance in which all citizens enjoy their right to\npolitical freedom and personal happiness.\nFifty years ago, the peoples of the world set down\nstandards for their security, happiness and well-being in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. In the intervening\nperiod, the international community and the United Nations\nhave made great strides in the area of human rights. Of\ngreat significance are the major human rights treaties which\nhave been adopted and which include the Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The\nbattle to make human rights truly universal has regrettably\nnot been won decisively, although there is no doubt that we\nare on the way to achieving that goal. We therefore need to\nredouble our efforts to pursue it.\nIn the post-cold-war era, attention has unfortunately\nbeen focused almost exclusively on civil and political\nrights, with less attention being paid to economic, social\nand cultural rights. That development is a human right is\noften forgotten. Such a narrow approach misses the\nimportant link that exists between the enjoyment of civil\nand political rights and development. The Declaration on\nthe Right to Development was intended to emphasize such\na link but, regrettably, this latest of recognized rights has\nyet to be factored into our human rights programmes.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, no topic is of\ngreater significance than the establishment of a permanent\nInternational Criminal Court. Over 50 years ago, this idea\nwas conceived out of the realization that domestic courts\nare often inadequate to deter crimes under international law,\nresulting in impunity for perpetrators of human rights\nabuses. The adoption of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court less than three months ago\nwas the culmination of a long battle fought by courageous\nmen and women for justice. The Statute is therefore our\nproud bequest to future generations.\nOver the years of negotiation on the Rome Statute,\nLesotho always affirmed the need for a court in which we\ncould have faith: an effective, independent and impartial\nCourt that enjoyed universal acceptance. In order to\nachieve this, a number of thorny and sensitive issues had\nto be resolved over the five-week period of the Rome\nConference. While not everything that we had hoped for\nhas been included in the Statute, we believe that the\npositive aspects of the Statute far outweigh its negative\nelements.\nIf, in the years ahead, there is to be greater respect\nfor international law and international humanitarian law,\nall States will have to take the International Criminal\nCourt seriously and adopt measures to ensure the coming\ninto operation of the court without delay. We thus urge\nthe Secretary-General to convene the Preparatory\nCommission in early 1999 to begin work on the rules of\nprocedure and evidence, guidelines for the court on the\nelements of crimes, the headquarters agreement and other\ninstruments. We also call upon the Assembly to endorse\nthe Rome Statute and urge States to ratify it in sufficient\nnumbers so that the court can start its work. Lesotho\nremains ready to work towards the accomplishment of\nthese tasks.\nDuring the current session of the General Assembly\nand the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement,\nrecently held in Durban, South Africa, the concern of the\ninternational community has focused on the phenomenon\nof globalization, an issue of particular importance for the\nleast developed countries. The liberalization of trade\nregimes and the promotion of an open and secure\nmultilateral trading system are central requirements for\nthe promotion of economic development.\nWhile the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations has resulted in significant improvements in\nmarket access conditions for the majority of countries of\nthe world, the expected gains for the least developed\ncountries from the stimulus to world trade arising from\nthe Uruguay Round are less clear. These countries\ncontinue to face significant obstacles to market access for\ntheir exports. There are still tariff peaks and tariff\nescalations against their major export items. Furthermore,\n11\n\n\nsome standards are too difficult to meet due to the\ndifferences in technological advancement.\nThe problems enumerated above attest to the\nimportance of the United Nations in shaping a world of\npeace, prosperity and development. A question that has\nplagued the United Nations since its founding has been that\nof disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament.\nNuclear weapons pose a serious threat to all humanity and\nits habitat, yet they remain in the arsenals built up during\nthe height of the cold war. Their time has passed, yet\nassertions of their utility continue. Nuclear weapons are\nheld by a handful of States which insist that these weapons\nprovide security benefits, and yet reserve uniquely to\nthemselves the right to own them. This situation is highly\ndiscriminatory, unstable and untenable. The possession of\nnuclear weapons by any State is a constant stimulus to\nother States to acquire them. For these reasons, it is a\ncentral reality that nuclear weapons diminish the security of\nall States.\nThe recent testing of nuclear weapons by India and\nPakistan was a self-fulfilling prophecy. As much as we\ndeplore the measures taken by these two countries, we must\nnot lose sight of the fact that they have been led down that\npath by the resistance of nuclear-weapons States to fulfil\ntheir obligations towards negotiating in good faith for a\ntotal ban of all nuclear weapons. We call upon all nuclear-\nweapons States to respond to the wishes of all humanity to\nban nuclear weapons from human experience by negotiating\na binding treaty for such a ban.\nLesotho supports the efforts of the Secretary-General\ntowards reforming the United Nations Organization. There\nis general agreement that the Security Council must be\nmade more democratic and its working methods more\ntransparent. For the great majority of States, the United\nNations is an indispensable tool for the realization of our\ndream for collective security and development. We are\ntherefore troubled that the efforts to reform the\nOrganization are bogged down in the most crucial area,\nnamely, the reform of the Security Council. The Charter\nhas conferred on that organ the most important\nresponsibility for international peace and security. The\nWorking Group on Security Council reform has been\nworking for almost five years without reaching a\nconclusion. The time has now come for a negotiating text\nto be prepared and for negotiations to commence.\nOtherwise, the whole exercise will turn into a charade in\nwhich all will lose interest.\nThe scourge of conflicts in Africa continues to\nundermine efforts towards economic and social\ndevelopment in that continent. Lesotho is deeply\nconcerned by the failure of UNITA to comply with the\nagreed timetable for the resolution of the conflict in\nAngola, in accordance with the provisions of the Lusaka\nProtocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe thus call on the international community, and the\nSecurity Council in particular, to assume its responsibility\nto apply firmly and resolutely the measures decreed by\nthe Council, especially within the context of resolutions\n1135 (1997) and 1173 (1998). Lesotho, as a member of\nSADC, supports the resolution of the recent SADC\nsummit in Mauritius, which held Mr. Savimbi accountable\nfor the resumption of hostilities in that country and thus\ndeclared him a political criminal.\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo is another source of concern to the Government of\nLesotho. This situation has seriously jeopardized efforts\nat consolidating peace, security and stability in the Great\nLakes region. Lesotho supports all efforts aimed at\npromoting a climate of peace and security in that region,\nincluding the SADC initiative as carried out by\nZimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.\nFinally, we remain disappointed by the slow pace of\nefforts at finding a lasting solution to the long-running\nproblem of Western Sahara. We therefore appeal to all\nparties concerned to respect and commit themselves to the\nletter and spirit of the United Nations settlement plan,\nwithin the context of the Houston accord, so that the\npeople of Western Sahara can at last join the rest of the\ninternational community as a peaceful, democratic and\nstable society as we move across the threshold of the next\nmillennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The election of the Foreign\nMinister of Uruguay as President of this General\nAssembly is very gratifying to our delegation and we are\nsure that his enormous talents and experience will guide\nus effectively through this critical session.\nWe also wish to acknowledge the contribution of his\npredecessor for the admirable guidance he provided the\nAssembly over the past year.\nThe inspired work of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, has brought new life and meaning to the\nUnited Nations, and we are grateful to him for his\ndedication to the task of modernizing the Organization.\nThe commitment to ongoing reform and renewal in this\nOrganization and the new vision and energy injected by\nthe Secretary-General have resulted in a revitalized\ninstitution that offers new hope.\nIn like fashion, the Belizean people demonstrated\ntheir political maturity when they turned out in record\nnumbers a month ago to elect a Government committed\nto setting a new and higher standard of governance to\ntake them through to the next millennium. We regard the\noverwhelming mandate given to our new Administration\nas a directive to transform our institutions and political\nculture into more democratic, open and just instruments\nfor the welfare of all our people.\nThe work of reform and renewal is never-ending.\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council, while\n16\n\n\nwe agree that this is urgently needed, we wish to urge all\nMembers to make every effort to ensure that the Working\nGroup produces a final package for the consideration of this\nAssembly.\nIt is to the credit of the United Nations that many\nmore people in today\u2019s world benefit from a culture of\ndemocracy and the rule of law. The United Nations has set\nthe pace in providing the support necessary to build and\nconsolidate the institutions of democracy. Central to this\nachievement has been the fact that the economic, cultural\nand social aspects which underpin democracy have not been\nignored.\nPerhaps the most powerful instrument for promoting\ndemocracy has been the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year.\nThis basic document has been fortified over the years by\nother commitments relating to second-, third- and fourth-\ngeneration rights and to the rights of children, women and\nindigenous people. Taken together, these commitments\nconstitute a challenge which we are all called upon to live\nup to.\nBelize is committed to pursue policies that lead to an\neconomic and social climate which nurtures the\ndevelopment of our children and offers real opportunities to\nour young people to be creative and productive and to\ndevelop self-respect, self-reliance and a sense of belonging\nto a community.\nOur Government recognizes the value of education in\npromoting gender awareness and improving the economic\nsituation of women, upon whom poverty casts a\ndisproportionate burden. Our policies for greater\nemployment, education in non-traditional areas and\nmicrocredit facilities will all be driven by gender awareness\nto foster greater access and opportunity for Belizean\nwomen.\nThe International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous\nPeople has served to raise public consciousness of the\nplight of peoples who for centuries have been\ndisadvantaged, exploited and marginalized. Our Government\ntakes seriously its duty to tangibly improve the quality of\ndaily life for indigenous people and will engage in\nrespectful negotiations with them in regard to their concerns\nabout land, natural resources and other matters.\nThe United Nations decolonization programme has\nbeen hailed as one of the most successful of the\nOrganization\u2019s undertakings over the past decades.\nHowever, enjoyment of the fundamental right to self-\ndetermination is still denied to the people of Western\nSahara and East Timor. Belize will continue to support\nthe work of the Special Committee on Decolonization to\nensure that these people are afforded opportunities for the\nfull expression of their will.\nThis year presents us with a telling irony: even as\nwe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of\nHuman Rights, we are painfully reminded that it is also\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the dispossession of the\nPalestinian people. We continue to press for the full\nrecognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and to establish an independent State,\nrespecting the independence and security of all the States\nin that region.\nWe are likewise concerned about the fact that a\nsister Caribbean nation continues to suffer from a policy\ndesigned to isolate it, even as it continues to be the target\nof terrorist attacks. The most fundamental human rights\nof the Cuban people are thus being violated, and we urge\nall concerned to work together with us in Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) and in the Association of\nCaribbean States to bring an end to this situation.\nBelize supports the efforts of the Republic of China\non Taiwan to participate fully in the work of this\nOrganization and its organs, as well as in international\nfinancial and developmental institutions. The time has\ncome for us to respect the sovereign will of that\npopulation, in conformity with the universalist principles\nof our Charter.\nWe all know that it is meaningless to talk about\nhuman rights without addressing the fact that millions of\npeople are falling into poverty even as incredible\nadvances in science and technology make possible the\neradication of poverty. This tells us that something is\nterribly wrong about the way the world economy is\nmanaged. If some resisted this conclusion before, the\ninstability of the present world financial markets is surely\nproof enough that unbridled globalization can have\nserious negative effects on developing and developed\ncountries alike.\nWe must move resolutely to create a new and fair\nmanagement regime for the world economy. We support\nthe proposed United Nations conference on financing for\ndevelopment, which should include consideration of social\nfactors and should seek to bring about comprehensive\nreform of the international financial system.\n17\n\n\nI speak for a country which has seen its prospective\nbase of prosperity whittled away over the past few years by\nmisguided economic policies, predatory politics and\nfinancial mismanagement. Our Administration has inherited\na country where some 40 per cent of the people live in\npoverty, where almost half of its children do not complete\nprimary school and where preventable diseases and infant\nmortality are on the rise. We have committed ourselves to\nan intensive integrated programme aimed at the elimination\nof poverty, based on growth economics that will restore\ninvestor confidence, stimulate economic activity and\nemployment and bring about more revenue for\ndevelopment.\nBut the stark reality is that no matter how hard we try,\nwe cannot do it alone. We are, therefore, especially\nencouraged by the words of the British Prime Minister,\nTony Blair, spoken to this Assembly a week ago, at the 7th\nmeeting:\n\u201cIf we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to\nensure that the least developed countries benefit from\nthis global economy ... [by] letting them sell their\ngoods without imposing tariffs on them ... actively\nhelping them benefit from globalization ... [and]\nrejecting any false allure of protectionism ... We also\nhave to ease the debt burden on the poorest countries.\u201d\nIn this connection, we emphatically endorse the call of\nthe Durban Summit of Non-Aligned Countries for new\nconcessional financial flows to debtor developing countries,\nin addition to debt cancellation and other debt relief\nmeasures.\nWe are also witnessing progressive decreases in the\namount of aid flowing to the developing countries. And too\noften we are victims of a trend in international agencies of\nspending millions on endless studies and consultancies,\nwhen what we need are concrete actions to solve the\nproblems we long ago identified.\nWe certainly welcome the work being done by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the\nprotection of our environment. Our population depends on\nits forests and clean seas to survive. The pristine condition\nof our natural resources affords us a competitive advantage\nas a prime destination for eco-tourism, and their rational\nmanagement and use is the only guarantee for our\nsustainable development.\nYet we have witnessed the wanton destruction of\nforests by transnational corporations and the depletion of\nmarine life by galloping consumption that is heedless of\nthe fragility of our ecosystems and of the social\nconsequences. The 1998 Human Development Report\nconcludes that gross inequalities in consumption have\nprevented over 1 billion people from meeting their basic\nconsumption requirements, a conclusion which led the\nreport\u2019s coordinator, Richard Jolly, to call for patterns of\nconsumption that are socially responsible, are not\ndestructive of the well-being of others, are sustainable and\ndo not degrade the natural resource base and environment\nfor present and future generations.\nAs if the uneven effects of the globalization of the\nworld economy were not enough to try us, we are faced\nwith the even more destructive phenomenon of the\nglobalization of crime and mindless violence, especially\nas manifested through the increased use of and trafficking\nin drugs and money-laundering. My country is in the\nunfortunate position of being along the way of the transit\ntrade to the country of greatest demand, and we daily\nsuffer the consequences in the ruined lives of our youth\nand the increased incidence of crime. We are doing\neverything possible to fight this scourge of mankind and\nwill cooperate fully with all regional and international\nefforts aimed at the effective curbing of the drug trade\nand its insidiously corrupting effects on our institutions\nand way of life.\nA world free of the curse of drugs, liberated from\nthe affliction of poverty, blessed with freedom and\ndemocracy where people\u2019s human right to a full and\ndignified life can be pursued in peace: this, surely, is\nwhat we are all striving for. Belize pledges to play its\npart in that glorious struggle, even as we ask the United\nNations to continue to support the independence and\nterritorial integrity of our nation, whose people, like\nhuman beings everywhere, seek only to assert their\nabsolute and inalienable right to human dignity.\nIn this search, we all need a vital and effective\nUnited Nations \u2014 this unique expression of our common\nhumanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

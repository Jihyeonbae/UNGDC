        "file_text": "At the outset,\nI would like to express my great and profound\nsatisfaction for the recent release of four hostages\nkidnapped in Iraq, among them a young woman whose\nmother is a San Marino national engaged in\nhumanitarian activities for the Iraqi civilian population.\nOn behalf of the Government of San Marino I wish\nwholeheartedly to thank the Government of Italy,\nwhich played an active role in the release, as well as all\nof those who made that release possible.\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of\nSan Marino I wish to congratulate Mr. Jean Ping,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. I also wish to thank the outgoing President,\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the total commitment and\ndetermination he showed in his work.\nUnited Nations activities have thus far been\ncrucial in reducing conflicts between States. However,\nalthough the number of international conflicts has\ndecreased, mankind is still facing new threats, which\ncan only be tackled multilaterally. So that it can\ncontinue to serve the international community, the\nUnited Nations should be given more effective tools to\nenhance mediation and peaceful settlement of disputes,\npreventive control, verification, planning and use of\nsanctions, in order to prevent the outbreak of warfare\nand to promote disarmament and arms control.\nMoreover, the United Nations must receive adequate\nsupport so that it can better meet the growing number\nof requests for peacekeeping operations in various\nregions of the world. In that context, we appreciate the\nresults obtained so far, but the process requires a\nstronger will on behalf of our Governments to comply\nwith international rules and implement a concrete and\neffective cooperation regime.\nIn line with relevant international standards, San\nMarino has recently passed a special law to combat\nterrorism and associated crimes. It is also actively\ncooperating with the two United Nations anti-terrorism\ncommittees established pursuant to Security Council\nresolutions 1267 (1999) and 1373 (2001).\nSince the tragic 11 September attacks on the\nUnited States of America, the international community\nhas become aware of the seriousness of the threat of\nterrorism. Recurrent dramatic events worldwide, the\nviolent attacks perpetrated in Iraq \u2014 not only against\nsoldiers but also civilians, the media and, most\nrecently, even volunteers of non-governmental\norganization humanitarian missions \u2014 force our\ncountries to realize the full scope of this phenomenon\nand its proliferation, and the need to search for a\n5\n\ncommon and effective response based on a stronger\njoint commitment.\nThe horrifying terrorist act carried out in Ossetia\nagainst hundreds of innocents and so many children\ndemonstrates that the widespread strategy of fear,\nhatred and devastation is humanly and ethically\nunacceptable.\nSan Marino once again condemns any form of\nterrorism, the most serious and impending threat to\npeace, for which there can be neither explanation nor\njustification. We support the search for constructive\nsolutions that promote dialogue and mutual\nunderstanding among peoples of different cultures and\nreligions with a view to the dissemination of an\nincreasingly shared culture of peace and cooperation\nthat will help to reject violence and oppression.\nThe Government of San Marino avails itself of\nthis opportunity to express its special thanks to the\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi, who contributed to the establishment of an\nIraqi interim Government, and renews its support to\nPrime Minister Allawi for the forthcoming democratic\nelections scheduled for January 2005. The elections\nwill surely be a milestone for the Iraqi people in the\nexercise of their sovereignty.\nWe trust that the international community will\nhelp to achieve national reconciliation in Iraq, on the\nbasis of Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) of\n8 June, with regard to independence, security and\nlegality. Despite the tragic attack on its headquarters in\nBaghdad last year, the United Nations can continue to\nplay a key role in Iraq, especially at a time when the\nsituation has become extremely complex and delicate,\nparticularly from a human and political point of view.\nAnother major source of concern and\ndisappointment for San Marino is the persistence of the\nMiddle East crisis, which remains unsolved despite the\nefforts made by the United Nations to encourage\ndialogue and indispensable mediation.\nTo achieve the ultimate goal of legitimate,\npeaceful and safe coexistence of two States, Israel and\nPalestine, the political process outlined in the road map\nand supported by the international community still\nappears to be the only viable solution. Therefore, on\nbehalf of the San Marino Government, I reiterate, as I\nrecently expressed to both the Foreign Ministers of\nIsrael and Palestine, our sincere hope that such a\nprocess will soon resume.\nWith regard to the reform of the Security\nCouncil, the position of the Republic of San Marino is\nwell known. We favour an increase in the number of\nnon-permanent members, in the most appropriate way,\nand of the gradual restriction of the right of veto, with\na view to its eventual elimination. Indeed, the increase\nof the number of permanent seats and the extension of\nthe right of veto would entail, in our view, a greater\ninjustice through the perpetuation of privileges, the\nconsolidation of discrimination within United Nations\nMember States, and it would limit the power of the\nGeneral Assembly to elect the most suitable candidates\nin accordance with differing historical periods.\nThe Government of San Marino fully endorses\nGeneral Assembly resolution 58/316, adopted on 1 July\n2004, relating to the revitalization of the work of the\nAssembly itself. Similarly, we are satisfied with\nresolution 58/314, adopted on the same day, granting\nthe Holy See wider and more incisive prerogatives as\nan Observer.\nThe safeguarding of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, together with full respect for\nfreedom, equality and democracy, have always been\nessential elements in the history of San Marino, and\nrepresent the very basis of its 1,700-year existence.\nThese issues continue to regulate relations with other\nStates and with international organizations. It is in this\nspirit that I express my best wishes once again to\nMs. Louise Arbour, the recently appointed United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nSan Marino firmly believes in the role of the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) and has recently\nsupported the draft ICC/United Nations relationship\nagreement and the setting up of an ICC liaison office in\nNew York.\nMy country remains strongly committed to the\ncampaign for the universal abolition of the death\npenalty, and it has recently ratified the Second\nOptional Protocol to the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death\npenalty.\nThe recent signature and ratification by San\nMarino of the United Nations Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen has been followed by a law granting full\ngender equality in the transmission of San Marino\ncitizenship to children. Moreover, the Government has\nsubsequently established for the first time in history a\nMinistry for Equal Opportunity.\n6\n\nAs 2004 is the International Year of the Family,\nwe hope that as many countries as possible will follow\nSan Marino in signing the two Optional Protocols to\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, which are\non the involvement of children in armed conflict; and\non the sale of children, child prostitution and child\npornography. In addition, San Marino recently ratified\nthe 1993 Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption,\nthus starting a wide debate domestically on joint\nparental custody in case of parental separation.\nEqual attention is being paid by my country to the\nmost disadvantaged members of our families and\nsocieties and to the issue of the increasing ageing of\nthe population, observed especially in developed\ncountries. Against this background, our Government\nhas been working to strengthen existing support\ninfrastructures and assistance to families.\nWe sincerely hope soon to reach an agreement on\nthe final text of an international convention on the\npromotion and protection of the rights and dignity of\ndisabled people.\nThe President took the Chair.\nSan Marino also wishes to underline the\nrelevance of the objectives set forth in the Monterrey\nConsensus, especially considering that 14 million\npeople, including 6 million children, are still dying of\nstarvation. One billion people have no access to\npotable water, and 3 billion human beings do not\nreceive adequate medical care.\nYet, poverty eradication cannot be implemented\nwithout respect for the ecosystem. In this regard, a\nvaluable instrument to develop and protect our\nenvironment is, in our opinion, the Convention to\nCombat Desertification, recently ratified by San\nMarino, along with a view to actively participate in the\nInternational Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d,\n2005-2015.\nIn accordance with the objectives of health for\nall, San Marino recently ratified the World Health\nOrganization Framework Convention on Tobacco\nControl and reiterates its support to the implementation\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, with\nthe awareness that the spreading of new epidemics\nrequires stronger international cooperation.\nOn this important occasion, year after year\nmeeting and exchanging views as representatives of\nour respective Governments, we express deeper and\ndeeper concern and frustration vis-\u00e0-vis the many\nthreats severely affecting humankind and possibly\njeopardizing our common future.\nYet, the ideals and principles we reaffirmed in the\nMillennium Declaration are still the highest benchmark\nto guide our efforts, both within our own States and\nwithin the work of the United Nations. We need to\ninstil hope and actualize our universal aspirations to\npeace, cooperation and development.\nTo this end, let me express my best and warmest\nwishes to you, Mr. President, to the Secretary-General,\nto all United Nations officials and to all our countries."

        "file_text": "At this time,\nwhen I have the honour to take the floor before this\naugust Assembly, above all I would like to express to\nyou, on behalf of the Congolese people as well as on\nmy own behalf, my warm congratulations to Mr. Jean\nPing on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly as well as the election of the members of his\nBureau.\nI also take this occasion to congratulate and give\nmy continued support to Mr. Julian Hunte, the\nPresident of the previous General Assembly, for the\nsignificant quality of the work he accomplished during\na difficult international situation.\nThis debate provides me the opportunity to bring\nthe message of my country to the world \u2014 a message\nof peace and national reconciliation \u2014 and to express\nour vision concerning the violent events taking place in\nthe world and the most appropriate way to find lasting\nsolutions to those events.\nIn that respect, looking back at world\ndevelopments, we can only note and deplore the rise in\ninternational terrorism in all its forms with its long line\nof victims, distress and desolation. This appears to me\nto be the appropriate time to announce that my\ncountry\u2019s commitment to the ratification of all\ninternational legal instruments on terrorism is moving\ninto its final phase of adoption. Our aim is to combat\nthat scourge which \u2014 I repeat \u2014 spares no one.\nApart from terrorism, the international\ncommunity is confronted with the resurgence of other\ndisasters which are just as murderous and devastating\nand which require us to strengthen our collective\nefforts. In particular I am thinking of HIV/AIDS,\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other endemic diseases.\nThat list of forgotten diseases should not obscure\nthe immense poverty and the natural disasters that we\nsee throughout the world. Moreover, we must not\nforget the areas of tension, civil wars and other armed\nconflicts which increase the misery and hopelessness\nof humanity and which thus sorely test international\npeace and security.\nDuring the intersessional period, the situation in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has been\ncharacterized by a process of political transition. In the\nlong term, we plan to organize elections which will\nenable the Congolese people to freely choose their\nleaders. In that respect, I would like to point out that\nthat process reached its midway point on 30 June 2004.\nIt has thus entered a decisive phase which requires\nfrom all institutions of the transition a redoubling of\neffort in order to meet the electoral deadlines as laid\nout in the global agreement.\nToday we can congratulate ourselves on the\nfollowing significant progress: the reunification of\nnational territory through the setting up of a land\ncommission under central authority; national\nreconciliation, symbolized by the presence in the\nGovernment of former enemies; and the beginning of\nthe process of integration of the army and the\nestablishment of the national police force.\nNevertheless, much remains to be done, including\nthe complete restoration of the authority of the State\nthroughout the country and the establishment of the\nnecessary internal and external conditions for the\nholding of the aforementioned elections.\nThus, taking into account the desire for peace of\nall of the Congolese people, and the determination\nexpressed many times by the transitional Government\nto respect the deadlines, it is important that we\nreinforce, in terms of quality and quantity, the United\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC), whose support of\nthe forces of order will help us put an end to the\n30\n\nactivism of the militias which continue to sow death\nand desolation in the eastern part of the country. In\naddition, given the results obtained by the political\nplayers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the\nfulfilment of their obligations under the global\nagreement, we launch an urgent appeal to the\ninternational community and ask it to respect its\npromises and commitments in bringing about the\nobjectives of the transition.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a\npeace-loving country, resolutely committed to\ndeveloping, maintaining and promoting excellent\nrelations with all countries dedicated to peace and\njustice and particularly, with its neighbours.\nAlso the principle of good neighbourliness, far\nfrom being a simple slogan, is for us a living and daily\nreality. That is why I am happy to see the signature of\nthe terms of reference, establishing a joint verification\nmechanism on the eastern border of our national\nterritory. This will enable us to rebuild trust in relations\nin the region, a process which will culminate in the\ninternational conference on peace, security and\ndevelopment, scheduled to take place shortly.\nThe other major task in the Great Lakes region\nremains preventing a recurrence of unfortunate events,\nsuch as the massacres of the people in Bukuvu, Ituri\nand those recently committed in Gatumba, Burundi,\nduring which 160 of our fellow citizens tragically lost\ntheir lives. This assassination of Congolese refugees on\nBurundian soil is the work of the enemies of peace and\nof peaceful cohabitation in our subregion. The people\nof Congo are waiting impatiently for the report of the\ninquiry being prepared under United Nations auspices\non this very subject.\nI solemnly express the Congolese people\u2019s faith\nin the United Nations, which has stood at our side at\nthe cost of many sacrifices. We firmly believe in its\nability to take even more responsibility on its\nshoulders, with a view to the ideas and principles\ncontained in the Charter, particularly with regard to its\nprocess of revitalization and the adaptation of its\nstructures so that it is able to rethink its working\nmethods in order that we will see peace, security and\npeaceful cohabitation come about among peoples\nthroughout the world.\nI would like to conclude my statement by\nassuring the Assembly of our will to bring to a\nsuccessful conclusion, with the help of the whole of the\ninternational community, the process of transition\nwithin the set deadlines so that the sons and daughters\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo are able to\nlive again in peace and dignity so long denied them\nand to which they legitimately have the right."

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all,\nto congratulate you, Sir, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nGabon, on your election as the President of the General\nAssembly and to wish you every success in this\nimportant position. I would also like to extend our\nappreciation to Mr. Julian Hunte for the excellent\norganization of the previous session.\nThe serious challenges to global stability and\nsustainable development that the international\ncommunity faces vindicate the urgent need to further\ndevelop the legal and institutional foundations of\nmultilateral cooperation. There is no doubt that the\ncentral role in coordinating these efforts belongs to the\nUnited Nations. It is important, today as never before,\nto define the direction of the dynamic adaptation of the\nUnited Nations to current realities, based on the\nOrganization\u2019s unique experience of over half a\ncentury, and to find adequate responses to the pressing\nissues of the contemporary world.\nDevelopments in the Central Asian region\nprovide a vivid demonstration of the intermingling of\nthe contradictory processes that are unfolding around\nthe globe. The aspirations of the peoples of Central\nAsia to fully integrate into the world community, to\ncreate conditions for sustainable stability and economic\ndevelopment are facing serious challenges. The region\nis faced with a combination of transnational threats,\nnamely terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking.\nSimilar patterns can be observed in other regions of the\nworld as well.\nNot a single day passes without terrorist acts\ntaking place somewhere in the world. It is obvious and\nundeniable that international terrorism has challenged\nthe civilized world. It makes no exceptions and does\nnot distinguish between places, nationalities, religions\nor social systems. It sows death and devastation in both\naffluent and developing nations. We need to admit that\ninternational terrorism, which is capable of quickly\ntransforming and adapting to the changing\ncircumstances of the contemporary world, is trying to\nimpose its terms and conditions and keep entire regions\nin fear.\nFrom the outset, Uzbekistan has firmly and\nvigorously supported the efforts of the anti-terrorist\ncoalition aimed at eradicating transnational threats.\nThe political leadership of Uzbekistan is deeply\ncommitted to the fight against this plague of the\ntwenty-first century and calls for a consolidation of the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts in this area.\nHowever, effectively fighting international\nterrorism requires, above all, combating its ideological\nsources. It is vital to oppose the ideology of extremism\nand fanaticism and to outlaw militant radical religious\ngroups that nurture international terrorism.\nAt the same time, Uzbekistan strongly opposes\nany kind of allegations or assertions linking\ninternational terrorism with the ever-growing religion\nof Islam, which has made an immense contribution to\nthe history of humanity. Uzbekistan, home of the\ngreatest thinkers and philosophers of the East, is\nadamantly pursuing an all-out support of traditional,\nenlightened Islam. Only by promoting and encouraging\nideas of an enlightened and tolerant Islam can we\neffectively withstand militant, politicized extremist\nfactions and avert further confrontations in the world.\nUzbekistan holds that, in reviewing the urgent\nissues of global security, the regional agenda should be\ngiven priority. Only by means of secure and stable\nregions can we gradually move towards global security.\nThe establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in\nCentral Asia remains one of the priorities of our\nforeign policy. We again call upon the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council to develop \u2014 in\ncooperation with the States of the region \u2014 a\nconsolidated position on the provisions of the treaty\nand its protocol. We trust that the establishment of this\nnuclear-weapons-free zone would become an important\nelement of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nMany issues of regional development are directly\nlinked to the processes taking place in Afghanistan. We\nbelieve that Afghanistan is historically and\ngeographically a part of Central Asia. Uzbekistan has\nbeen giving all possible assistance to the Afghan\npeople for the social and economic reconstruction of\nthe country and its harmonious integration into\nregional structures. The Government of Uzbekistan, in\ncooperation with United Nations agencies, has set up\nand is successfully implementing a delivery\nmechanism for international humanitarian assistance to\nAfghanistan via Uzbekistan. To date, over 2.5 million\ntons of such cargo has passed through our territory. In\naddition, we are doing all we can to reduce transit costs\nand improve the service infrastructure.\nIn light of the continuous threat of narcotics\nproliferation from Afghanistan, Central Asia, on the\n24\n\nfrontline of combating narco-aggression, is facing the\nproblem of effectively countering this global menace.\nWe look forward to the international community\u2019s firm\nand continuous support of Uzbekistan\u2019s initiative to\nestablish a Central Asian regional information and\ncoordination centre to combat transborder crime related\nto illegal drug trafficking.\nThe United Nations has been present in\nUzbekistan for over a decade. During this period, the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has\ncarried out numerous important projects aimed at\nstrengthening the country\u2019s potential in implementing\nreforms, protecting the environment and creating\nsustainable sources of income. We truly appreciate this.\nIn this regard, we look forward to assistance from\nUNDP and other United Nations agencies in\nimplementing Uzbekistan\u2019s initiative to establish a\nCentral Asian common market. This would contribute\nnot only to creating a large and robust regional market\nand attracting more foreign investment and modern\ntechnologies, but also to properly addressing the social\nand environmental problems of Central Asia, including\nits sustainable development and economic prosperity.\nOvercoming the transportation and\ncommunication isolation of the region is another top\npriority. In that context, I would like to draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to the multilateral initiative to\nestablish a trans-Afghan transport corridor, which\nwould link Central Asia with the Persian Gulf. The\nimplementation of that project would significantly\nexpand trade and economic relations and\nfundamentally improve the region\u2019s economic\nprospects.\nWe agree with the view of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, that the present juncture is of crucial\nimportance for the United Nations. There is no other\nmultilateral forum similar to the United Nations, in\nwhich countries that differ from one another in terms\nof cultural and historical heritage, economic potential\nand geographic location can work together as equal\npartners.\nIn the context of the current, increasingly\ncomplex globalization processes, the strengthening of\nthe Security Council is of paramount significance.\nUzbekistan supports the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil in both categories of membership, taking into\naccount the political and economic capabilities of\ncountries, geographical representation and other\ncriteria. We reiterate our support for the inclusion of\nGermany and Japan in the Security Council as\npermanent members.\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to\nunderscore the fact that Uzbekistan is confident that\nthe United Nations will retain its role as the main pillar\nof the international security and cooperation\narchitecture. We believe that the invaluable potential of\nthe United Nations, which withstood all the upheavals\nof the previous century, will long serve the cause of\nconsolidating our efforts in the face of global\nchallenges."

        "file_text": "The United Nations\nfaces unprecedented challenges: the recent past has\nbrought about a worrisome erosion in the standing and\ncredibility that this great Organization has enjoyed\n24\n\nworldwide. Use of military force without prior\nauthorization by the Security Council and increasingly\ndifficult and dangerous conditions under which United\nNations personnel operate in many places are but two\nexamples illustrating this trend.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has given a two-\ntiered response. First, he issued a call for an\nunequivocal commitment to the principle of\nmultilateralism, upon which this Organization is built.\nAnd secondly, he commissioned a report from eminent\nand highly experienced personalities on how the\nOrganization should address new threats and\nchallenges.\nLiechtenstein believes that this was the right\nresponse. An unequivocal and unwavering commitment\nfrom all of us is the basis for collective action and for\nobserving the rules we have set for ourselves. Only this\ncommitment can give meaning to our decisions to\ntackle new challenges, and only this can enable us to\nfurther develop a rules-based framework in order to\nlook confidently into the future.\nWe must acknowledge the fact that the challenges\nwe are facing today were not foreseeable when the\nfounding fathers agreed on the terms which guide the\nwork of this Organization. At the same time, we must\nalways recognize the Charter of the United Nations as\nthe unique achievement that it is and examine our\ncurrent ways of applying this great tool that was passed\ndown to us. It is therefore our obligation to conduct an\nin-depth and sober analysis of these new challenges in\norder to make an informed decision about how best to\naddress them within the framework of the United\nNations system. Changes and creative approaches will\nbe needed.\nWe therefore very much look forward to\nreceiving and considering the report of the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change established\nby the Secretary-General. But however insightful their\nfindings and however visionary their recommendations\nmay be \u2014 and we have high hopes that they will be \u2014\nthe necessary decisions to expand the existing\nmultilateral architecture will have to be made by us,\nthe States gathered in this Assembly on the threshold\nof the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Not\nin 10 years. Now. The time is right.\nIn a globalized world, collective action is the\nnecessary response to a great number of challenges.\nEffective measures in numerous areas \u2014 the\nenvironment, HIV/AIDS, poverty-reduction, the fight\nagainst terrorism, to name but a few \u2014 can only be\ntaken on the basis of genuine and efficient global\ncooperation. Such cooperation can only be successful\nif it is based on a set of transparent and clear rules\napplied in the same manner to everybody who\nparticipates in it. International law is clearly the\nprimary instrument in this respect. However, we have\nwitnessed contradictory tendencies in the area of\ninternational law, especially in the recent past.\nOn the positive side, there have been landmark\nachievements, most notably the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court. For the first time in the\nhistory of mankind, there is an independent Court,\nbased on a Statute negotiated by the international\ncommunity at a diplomatic conference, that has the\ncompetence to try individuals responsible for the worst\ncrimes when States themselves fail to do so. We are\nsadly reminded every day how much such an\ninstitution is needed. On the negative side, we have\nobserved a dangerous erosion in the application of\nlong-standing international law standards, most notably\nin the field of international human rights and\ninternational humanitarian law. The stage we have\nreached is critical and there can be only one response:\nWe must urgently reverse this trend and uphold the\nprimacy of the rule of law, both nationally and\ninternationally.\nWe firmly believe that the rule of law is an\nindispensable element of sound domestic policies \u2014\noften referred to as good governance \u2014 and an\nindispensable part of sustainable development\nworldwide. International organizations, including the\nUnited Nations, are called upon to continue their\nefforts to assist States in establishing and applying the\nrule of law. We strongly support the efforts made over\nthe past year to strengthen the role of the United\nNations in that respect.\nThe rule of law at the domestic level must be\ncomplemented at the international level through full\nand unconditional respect for internationally\nrecognized standards and transparent and fair rules in\ninternational decision-making. We have been very slow\nin dealing with the changes in the world and its\nconsequences, most notably with regard to non-State\nactors who fall outside the framework of international\nlaw as we have known it in the past. We must ensure\nthat all those individuals and groups that play a\nsignificant role in the international arena are not\n25\n\nallowed to move in a legal vacuum and we must clarify\nwhich rules apply to them. That, however, we can do\ncredibly and thus effectively only if we, the\nGovernments representing States, continue to respect\nthe standards we have created for ourselves.\nThe one body that is particularly called upon in\nthat respect is the Security Council \u2014 to many, the\nepitome of the United Nations as a whole. The Council\nmust meticulously observe the mandate given to it\nunder the Charter and ensure transparency and clarity\nin its decision-making. That is of special importance\nwhere the Council\u2019s decisions directly affect the rights\nand obligations of individuals who are not entitled to\nindividual legal remedies \u2014 a situation which can be\ndifficult to reconcile with the rule of law.\nA strong momentum is gathering for reform of\nthe Security Council after more than 10 years of\ndeliberations on that very complex topic. In light of the\nchallenges before the Council and the open questions\nconcerning its role, in particular with regard to\nincreasing legislative activities, successful reform must\naddress all aspects. Enlargement to make that body\nmore modern and representative is one such aspect. We\nbelieve that it is not sound for a universal Organization\nto have its major decisions in a truly vital area taken by\nonly a handful of States.\nFurthermore, the working methods of the\nCouncil, its accountability to the membership as a\nwhole and its mandate must also be addressed.\nLiechtenstein, and its delegation in New York in\nparticular, will continue to stand ready to make their\ncontribution to that end.\nIn accordance with the Charter, the Council acts\non behalf of the entire membership in carrying out its\nduties, and its decisions are binding on all Member\nStates. All States should therefore take a strong interest\nin its work and make use of their opportunities to\ninteract with and express their views to the Council,\nwhether they are members or not. More openness and\ninclusiveness in the Security Council are still both\ndesirable and feasible. The question remains, however:\nIs the Security Council too powerful or do we simply\nlack the necessary system of checks and balances? We\nsupport a dynamic and strong Security Council and\ntherefore tend to the latter view, with a clear focus on\nan enhanced role for the General Assembly, the only\nuniversal organ of the United Nations. The measures\non revitalization upon which we were able to agree\nduring the last session show us how far we still have to\ngo. It must be our goal to make this Assembly an\nefficient and effective body that can act and react\nquickly and with resolve.\nWe are still very far away from that goal. The\nmomentum gathered over the past year must be\ntranslated into further, bold measures and trigger a\nprocess that is not reversible. This is no time for\ncomplacency and no time for indifference. This\nAssembly has historical tasks before it. We must leave\nlethargy and short-term national interests behind in the\ninterest of the greater good. Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan put it very aptly in his speech this past Tuesday:\nIf we cannot reach agreement on the way forward,\nhistory will make the decisions for us. We must set a\nvision for the future and live up to our responsibility.\nWe owe this to all future generations and to ourselves."

        "file_text": "There\nare moments we can describe as historical turning\npoints, when nations and peoples must decide which\nside they are on. This is one of these moments, when\nhistory will judge us and examine if we were\ndemocratic leaders that represented the will of our\npeoples.\nIt is clear that the peoples of the world are taking\na stand against neo-liberal economics and war. They\nare fighting against those who would impose their will\nby military force and economic violence. They are\nresisting those who would undermine and even\noverthrow the basic principles that founded this\nOrganization that brings us together today. Under such\nconditions, Venezuela echoes the call of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that all the nations\nthat proclaim the rule of law in their territory respect it\nabroad.\nAs you know, the majority of the peoples and\nGovernments of the world took a stand against the\nillegal war in Iraq. In this context, Venezuela reaffirms\nthe words of President Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero that peace\nis a task that demands more courage, more\ndetermination and more heroism than war.\nThe principal question for us is now the\nfollowing: are we building a world of real democracy,\nequality and justice or a world led by the tyranny of\neconomic and military power? The people of\nVenezuela were faced with such a decision last month,\nwith a referendum on the presidency. In fact, in the last\nsix years, Venezuelans have participated in eight\ndemocratic procedures, including referendums and\nelections. The 1999 Bolivarian Constitution of\nVenezuela allows for a mid-term referendum on a\nrecall of the popular vote. On 15 August of this year,\ncitizens of Venezuela clearly exercised their\nconstitutional right and, in an historic referendum\nnever before seen in the history of the world, ratified\nthe mandate of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas, thus\nconfirming the democratic process of structural\ntransformation led by our President.\nSince the end of the last millennium, we have\nwitnessed tremendous dissent from citizens of the\nworld against neo-liberalism and war. In my country,\nby the late eighties, a set of structural adjustments,\ndeveloped under the influence of the main centres of\nneo-liberal capitalism, was met with a popular uprising\nthat paralysed the country, leaving an indelible mark on\nour people\u2019s minds. That resistance, popularly known\nas \u201cEl Caracazo\u201d, was perhaps the first protest against\nneo-liberalism. The poor took control of the capital,\nCaracas, as well as cities across the country to\ndemonstrate their discontent with increasing poverty\nand the unjust distribution of the profits from our\nnation\u2019s oil wealth. The ruling Government of the day\nresponded by sending in armed forces to suppress the\nprotests, killing thousands of people. That was a\npainfully tragic moment for the people of Venezuela.\nNevertheless, that event provoked the necessary\nconsciousness, igniting a political awakening among\nthe people that allowed them to unite their voices in the\nfight against neo-liberalism.\nOver the next decade, we witnessed protests\nagainst the World Trade Organization and against neo-\n44\n\nliberalism in Chiapas, Davos, Seattle, Prague, Quebec\nCity and Genoa. Wherever the architects of neo-\nliberalism gathered, they were met with massive\nprotests in the streets.\nWe also witnessed the desperate actions of the\nbrave South Korean farmer in Canc\u00fan, who gave his\nlife to call attention to the plight of his fellow farmers\non the brink of disaster throughout the world.\nThe war in Iraq only strengthened the global\nprotests. On 15 February 2003, an estimated 30 million\npeople around the world marched in protest and\ndisbelief, unwilling to stand idly by as once again the\nworld\u2019s screams fell on deaf ears, as not-so-smart\nbombs fell on little children without knowing why. If\nwe combine the protests against neo-liberal\nglobalization with the anti-war demonstrations, we will\nfind a global rebellion of revolutionary proportions has\nstarted. What we need to decide now is whether we\nwill march in the streets alongside our people or hide\nourselves away in an ivory tower.\nMy fellow leaders, have we no eyes and ears?\nCan we not see the suffering? Can we not hear the cries\nof the poor, the disenfranchised, the disappeared and\nthe desolate? Can we afford to shirk that\nresponsibility?\nAccording to the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), 44 per cent of Latin Americans\nlive below the poverty line. Although Latin America is\nnot the only region to face that reality, it is a\nparticularly conspicuous example because it represents\nthe laboratory of the neo-liberal project. Structural\nadjustment, as prescribed by the Washington\nConsensus, came early to Latin America, and its\napplication here became the model for the neo-\nliberalization of the former communist-bloc countries\nin the 1990s.\nBesides being the initial site of neo-liberalism\u2019s\ndevastating experiment, Latin America was also the\nfirst to experience anti-neo-liberal explosion. Last\nMarch, UNDP released a report entitled \u201cDemocracy in\nLatin America\u201d, which highlighted a startling\nrevelation: more than half of Latin Americans would\nprefer dictatorship over democracy if an authoritarian\nregime would solve their economic problems.\nA second report, released this past August by the\nprivate firm Latinobar\u00f3metro, came to a similarly\ndepressing conclusion \u2014 but with one notable\nexception: between 1996 and 2004 support for\ndemocracy actually grew in Venezuela, much more so\nthan in any other country in the region. In Venezuela\nsupport for democracy has undoubtedly increased.\nCould it be that there is a direct correlation between\nthose findings and the fact that Venezuela is actively\npursuing a viable alternative to market democracy?\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist, Amartya\nSen, affirms that democracy is the best remedy for\nhunger. Indeed, in Venezuela, under the leadership of\nPresident Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas, we achieved that goal by\ngiving power to the poor. To reduce poverty, it is\nnecessary to increase democracy. There is no other\nway. Democracy is also the only way to defeat\nterrorism. No matter if poverty and hunger create the\nconditions for its existence, there are no \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d terrorists. There is only one terrorism \u2014\nreprehensible, detestable and cowardly. But, once\nagain, only through greater democracy can we defeat it.\nWhat the UNDP report reveals is that Latin\nAmericans have lost faith in a model of democracy\nwhose scope is limited to political representation. It is\na model that has entirely ignored the economic, social\nand participatory facets of democracy and which has\nconsequently completely failed to reflect the popular\nwill. As Simon Bol\u00edvar, our visionary liberator,\nadvocated two centuries ago, the best form of\ngovernment is one that provides the highest degree of\nhappiness, stability and social security for its people.\nA few days ago, President Lula of Brazil chaired\na hugely successful meeting of world leaders on the\ntheme \u201cAction Against Hunger and Poverty\u201d. That\nwonderful initiative, co-sponsored by Presidents\nChirac, Lagos Escobar and Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero,\nexpressed our common vision to fight against poverty\nand social injustice to guarantee security and\nsustainable development in both the North and the\nSouth. Our absolute support for that initiative is\nexpressed in the document on the subject of ending\npoverty and giving power to the poor which we\ndistributed to Members at the beginning of the General\nAssembly session.\nTo that end we recognize the need to go beyond\nthe traditional official development assistance\nframework. Venezuela\u2019s contribution to the fight\nagainst hunger represents a genuine attempt to place\nthe tools of development in the hands of those who\nneed it most. In shifting from food aid to food\n45\n\nsovereignty, we are not limiting ourselves to helping to\nfeed the poor; rather, we are committed to helping the\npoor to feed themselves.\nFor that reason food sovereignty in Venezuela\nputs a clear emphasis on assisting small producers\nfrom community-run cooperatives. A far-reaching land\nreform has already transferred over 2 million hectares\nof land to small producers. We have also made a firm\ncommitment to create a world seed bank in our country\nto protect our heritage of seeds from the violent\nencroachments of transgenic and genetically modified\ncrops.\nIn addition, we have recently created a Ministry\nof Food and Nutrition to guarantee our people their\nfundamental rights in that area.\nVenezuela ardently supports the initiatives under\nway to reform the United Nations. As supporters of\nmultilateralism and participatory democracy, we claim\na greater participation of the countries of the South at\nthe United Nations, and particularly in a more\ndemocratic Security Council, one in which there is no\nright of veto. In that regard, we support the candidacy\nof Brazil as a permanent member of an expanded\nCouncil.\nVenezuela aspires to join the Economic and\nSocial Council for the period 2005-2007. Our presence\nin the Economic and Social Council will help the\npeoples of the South to promote at the global level the\nideas and social justice we are trying to enact\ndomestically. To achieve that objective and to attain the\nMillennium Development Goals, we believe that the\ncountries possessing the resources must make a\nfinancial effort commensurate with the challenge.\nVenezuela has invested $2 billion in social\nprogrammes this year, and we recently helped establish\na fund of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) to combat desertification and\ndrought, which greatly threaten our African brothers.\nThat assistance from OPEC members reflects our\nsolidarity with our brothers and sisters in Africa.\nVenezuela has already had the opportunity to assist\nseveral African countries through its policy of\ncooperation.\nThe United Nations was born in a world that was\ntraumatized by the atrocities of Second World War, yet\nhad the hope of creating a world of greater dignity for\nhuman beings.\nFifty-five years later, when we observe that the\nwill of the General Assembly is often not respected, it\nappears that we have lost our course. Thus, we run the\nrisk of submerging the world in a war of a thousand\nyears. It is time to put an end to the hypocrisy that\npermits a situation in which some resolutions are\nfollowed while others go unheeded.\nLet us have the courage to recover the original\ngoals of the Assembly. If we are courageous, we will\nrecognize not only that another world is possible but\nthat this other world is crucial for humanity."

        "file_text": "Sir, it is with great\npleasure that I congratulate you on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nWe are living in trying and turbulent times. As we\nmeet, the world continues to be haunted by the spectre\nof terrorism, as most recently evidenced in Russia and\nIraq. The victims are, as always, the innocent. The\nobjective is global instability and insecurity, leading to\nincreased intolerance and social regression. The\nhideousness of the means employed by terrorists\nexposes them for what they are. No just political cause\ncan be served by such acts.\nThe war against terrorism is a struggle against\nbarbarism. The perpetrators of terror must be rooted\nout and their bases and networks destroyed. This war is\ninherently a campaign in support of the values of the\n48\n\nUnited Nations \u2014 the values that we all seek to\nfoster \u2014 and it is in response to a threat that has\nserious implications for all of the Member States of our\nOrganization. Our challenge is actively to defend\nfreedom against the forces of tyranny to affect the\nconditions that help create the spectre of terrorism.\nIf anyone thought the threats to global security\nthat provided the impetus for looking at serious\nreforms of the United Nations system had receded,\nthen surely the recent terrorist outrage in southern\nRussia gives pause for reflection. The great challenges\nin Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in parts of Africa,\nand the considerable work still remaining to achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals testify to the fact\nthat the need for change has not passed. On the\ncontrary.\nThe High-level Panel will soon submit its report,\nand next year a summit is planned for the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations and the fifth year\nafter the Millennium Summit. Iceland believes that we\nnow have a historic opportunity to undertake\nmeaningful and long-awaited reform. This would in no\nsmall way be a reinforcement of the idea of\nmultilateralism and, if genuine and far-sighted, will\nequip the United Nations to deal more effectively with\nthreats to global security.\nIt will be our weighty responsibility here next\nyear to hammer out decisions on reform. We will have\nthe opportunity to make changes that will equip the\nmultilateral system to be more effective in preventing\nconflict, in resolving conflict where it occurs and in\npost-conflict peace-building.\nWe can of course choose to do nothing. We can\nlinger complacently in the inertia of the status quo. The\nconsequence would, however, be that the United\nNations would become less and less capable of facing\nthese common challenges to our security.\nIn particular, we must grasp the chance to make\nthe Security Council itself more representative, while\nincreasing its efficiency and effectiveness. The\ndiscussions of many years on increasing the number of\nnon-permanent and permanent seats must reach a\nconclusion. It is time that certain countries that have\nlong made a considerable contribution to the work of\nthe United Nations be given permanent seats on the\nSecurity Council. I am referring in particular to\nGermany, India, Japan and Brazil. But it is no less\nimportant to ensure that Africa also be given a\npermanent seat on the Council.\nSmaller States make up the vast majority of\nUnited Nations Members. Ensuring that smaller States\nare adequately represented in the various organs of the\nUnited Nations is not only a matter of paying due\nregard to the principles of sovereignty; it is also a\npractical matter of ensuring that the particular\nchallenges faced by smaller States \u2014 both island States\nand others \u2014 are taken into account in the multilateral\nsystem. Iceland knows the problems related to being\nfar away from potential markets. We know well the\nstruggle of small economies to diversify, and we have\ndirect experience of the vulnerability of small countries\nto external economic shocks and natural disasters. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to extend our\nsympathy to all those Caribbean States that have\nsuffered so much in the recent hurricanes. My\nGovernment is considering ways in which it could\ncontribute to disaster relief or reconstruction.\nJust as it is fundamental to the legitimacy of the\nSecurity Council that there be fair representation of the\nvarious regions of the world, it is also important that\nthe many smaller States feel that their issues are\nunderstood and taken into account. In that context, I\nwould like to refer to the previously announced\ncandidacy of my country, Iceland, for a non-permanent\nseat on the Security Council for the period 2009-2010,\nwhich was already endorsed in 1998 by the Nordic\nStates \u2014 Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden \u2014\nwithin the Group of Western European and other\nStates.\nSmaller States make a valuable contribution to\nrunning the multilateral system. Smaller States provide\nsome of the most innovative thinking on approaches to\nthe challenges we face and \u2014 in per capita terms and\noften in absolute terms \u2014 are some of the most\ngenerous contributors.\nAn issue of key concern to small island States,\nbut also to the world at large, is sustainable use of the\nworld\u2019s resources. As Iceland completed its term as a\nmember of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment (CSD), my Government was very pleased\nto see the organizational changes in the working\nmethods of the CSD implemented at its twelfth session,\nin April. My Government looks forward to continuing\nits active participation in the future work of the CSD to\nachieve and promote the sustainable development of\n49\n\nthe world\u2019s resources. Iceland will also continue to\nwork on alternative energy resources, particularly the\npossibilities of hydrogen as a clean-energy provider.\nIceland is committed to attaining the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals as they are set out in the\nMillennium Declaration. My Government will\nparticipate actively in the preparations for the major\nsummit in 2005. It is clear that the international\ncommunity must speed up its efforts in order to\nachieve, before 2015, the goals set by the Millennium\nSummit. We regard the 2005 summit to be one of the\nimportant milestones on the way to attaining them.\nI now turn to questions concerning particular\nregions. Iceland warmly welcomes the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD)\ninitiative and its aim of ensuring democracy, human\nrights, good governance and sound economic\nmanagement. The efforts of African countries in the\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in their own\nregion and the establishment of a Peace and Security\nCouncil within the African Union are ground-breaking\ndevelopments, as are the African mediation in a\nnumber of conflicts and the efforts of the African\nUnion and African regional organizations to develop\ntheir capabilities for peace-supporting operations.\nSub-Saharan Africa continues to be the focus of\nIcelandic bilateral development cooperation, and we\nwill continue to increase our contribution to and\ninvolvement in multilateral development cooperation.\nIceland welcomes the recent understanding\namong members of the World Trade Organization on a\nframework for the continuation of the Doha\ndevelopment round of negotiations on trade\nliberalization. The multilateral trading system is a\nproven vehicle for promoting economic development\nand growth, and it is central to the future prosperity of\nour nations. It is noteworthy that particular attention is\npaid to the needs of the least developed countries. It is\nimportant that they fully reap the benefits that the\nmultilateral trading system has to offer. Iceland\nbelieves that the framework will give the negotiators in\nGeneva a new platform for the prompt conclusion of\nthe Doha round. We want to do our part in making sure\nthat globalization benefits all countries, not least\nthrough targeted development cooperation. In an effort\nto assist African countries in making the most of the\nDoha round, Iceland is participating, together with the\nother Nordic countries, in the Nordic Africa initiative.\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004),\nunanimously adopted on 6 June, provided for the\nrestoration of sovereignty in Iraq. The resolution\nassigns the United Nations a leading role in helping to\nbuild a legitimate representative Government and\ndemocratic institutions. It also demonstrated the will of\nthe Council \u2014 and indeed of the rest of the\ninternational community \u2014 to resolve past differences\nand to give first priority to the political and economic\nreconstruction of Iraq. My Government remains\nprepared to lend its support to the difficult work ahead\nin Iraq. In Iraq, as elsewhere, Iceland would like to\nemphasize the importance of ensuring the safety of\nUnited Nations missions.\nAfghanistan will continue to occupy our attention\nin the coming months. The United Nations has done\nvaluable work in registering some 10 million voters.\nThe presidential elections on 9 October in Afghanistan\nwill be an important milestone in the process of\nrebuilding the country. We must maintain an ongoing\ncommitment to Afghanistan, where serious challenges\nto the rebuilding of the country continue to be faced.\nIceland has demonstrated its support and has assumed\nthe leading role in running the Kabul international\nairport, under the auspices of the NATO-led\nInternational Security Assistance Force.\nAn area of continuing concern is, of course, the\nMiddle East. The Icelandic Government continues to\ncall on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resume\nnegotiations on a political settlement. The road map\nsets out a realistic way to achieve a two-State solution.\nIceland fully supports the efforts of the Quartet. We\nurge the Quartet and all other well-intentioned parties\nto continue to focus on this issue.\nAt the beginning of my remarks, I concentrated\non terrorism. Terrorism is an assault on human rights. I\nwould like to express strong support for the initiative\nof the Secretary-General urging Member States to\nratify all those conventions that concern protection of\nthe rights of the ordinary citizen.\nIn conducting the war against terrorism, we must\nprotect the human rights that terrorists themselves\nflout. We must be sure that human rights and\nhumanitarian law are not sacrificed. Here, I would like\nto refer to the key role played by the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross \u2014 and by the entire Red\nCross and Red Crescent movement \u2014 in monitoring\nthe implementation of the Geneva Conventions, and at\n50\n\nthe same time to express my appreciation for that\nwork.\nDuring this session of the General Assembly,\nIceland will continue to work to advance the issue of\nhuman rights. In that context, we look forward to\nmarking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into\nforce of the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women, and we urge\nthose States that are not parties to accede to the\nConvention. Iceland will also continue to work with\nothers to uproot racism and religious intolerance as a\nmajor way to prevent conflict and create a secure\nhuman environment.\nIceland is totally committed to the multilateral\nsystem, of which the United Nations is the fulcrum.\nWithout an effective multilateral system, conflict and\nits causes will be much more difficult to address. But,\nin order to be effective, the system needs change. The\nGovernment of Iceland sincerely hopes that we can\nbring about necessary change during the next year, and\nwe look forward to working with all Member States to\nthat end."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to convey the greetings and best\nwishes of the people of my country to Member States\nand their people, and to the Secretary-General.\nWar, oppression, crime, hatred and suffering\nplague hundreds of millions of men and women all\nover the world today. In pursuit of the ideals of peace,\ndemocracy and happiness, the United Nations is the\nunited conscience of humankind. In order to achieve\nthe goals of the Millennium Declaration, our\nOrganization must be strengthened structurally,\neconomically and spiritually.\nSerbia and Montenegro therefore supports both\nthe initiatives for the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil, that based on the need for equal\nrepresentation of all continents, and that which\nconcedes a special role for the most developed\ncountries, without whose support the United Nations\nwould be unable to fulfill its noble goals.\nThe fight against global terrorism in all its\nmanifestations, such as anti-Semitism and anti-\nIslamism, is our primary responsibility today. Those\nwho perpetrated, masterminded and bankrolled terrorist\natrocities in New York, Washington, Moscow, Beslan,\nJerusalem, Madrid, Istanbul and other places have not\nonly declared war against all nations, but also against\nGod himself, who is the same God for all people.\nIn the fight against terrorism, force is\nunavoidable, but prevention is what we need most.\n52\n\nPoliticians, international religious and spiritual leaders\nand the media must constantly emphasize that the\nkilling of children and of innocent civilians are crimes\nthat the terrorists are perpetrating against their own\nreligions and nations and that God will neither forgive\nthem nor reward them with paradise for such crimes.\nMultilateralism is the only means to prevent the\ncatastrophe of the clash between faiths and\ncivilizations. At the same time, terrorism must be\ncondemned with equal resolve by everyone. There can\nbe no acceptable terrorists, nor should terrorists be\nproclaimed as `freedom fighters\u2019 anywhere.\nSerbia and Montenegro is a small country that has\nbeen confronted with most of the world\u2019s current\nproblems and misfortunes. The recent wars that saw the\nbreak-up of Yugoslavia - one of the founding members\nof the United Nations - have had immense and painful\nconsequences: unemployment; poverty; the tragic\nplight of some 600,000 refugees; hopelessness among\nyoung people, which breeds drug dependence; a rising\nsuicide rate; and the desperate position of Serbs in\nKosovo and Metohija.\nThe reality of Kosovo and Metohija today is both\ndramatic and grim. Over the past five years, the\ninternational administration and dominance of the\nAlbanian majority of this Serbian province have led to\nthe killing or abduction of more than 2,500 Serbs,\nincluding many children, and to the destruction of\n1,500-year-old churches and monasteries and\napproximately 40,000 homes. As a result of terrorism\nand massive violations of basic human rights, nearly\n200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians have been\nexpelled from Kosovo and Metohija.\nThe hopes of suffering victims are directed\ntowards the United Nations, particularly its bodies and\nspecialized agencies. I take this opportunity to express\nmy most profound gratitude to the Secretary-General\nand to the Director-General of UNESCO for the\ndecision to convene, in November, an international\ndonor conference aimed at funding the reconstruction\nof destroyed churches and monasteries in Kosovo. We\nare also grateful for the principled position that all\nhomes must be rebuilt, that conditions must be created\nfor the return of all of those who have been expelled\nand that the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija must be\nguaranteed the right to life and to freedom of\nmovement and all civil, national and religious freedoms.\nThe spirit of a united Europe and a united world\nlives in the hearts of Serbs and Montenegrins. While\nwe respect the existing State borders that we share with\nour neighbours, we wish to erase them in everyday life\nand to build a common European future based on\ndialogue, reconciliation and equality among all nations.\nWe are fully confident that, with the strong support of\nthe United Nations, we will attain that goal.\nBut the insistence by some on the creation of a\nsovereign State of Kosovo amounts to a call for the\nbreak-up of the sovereign State of Serbia and\nMontenegro. Such an objective breeds new hatred and\nmisery and is contrary to the basic tenets of\ninternational law and to the Charter of the United\nNations. We will not agree to the violation of the rights\nof our State and its citizens.\nBy applying consistent standards in addressing all\ncrimes, the United Nations will assist the efforts of the\ndemocratic Government in Serbia and Montenegro to\nfulfill our obligations to the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is something\nwe must do. The nation is innocent; responsibility rests\non the individual, and none of those who have been\nindicted for war crimes has the right to hold a nation\nhostage.\nAll of us on this planet are brothers and sisters.\nGens una sumus: we are all one family. Therefore, the\nprimary obligation of any majority, whether religious,\nracial or ethnic, is to fully protect the rights of\nminorities. I can assure the Assembly that my\nGovernment is unreservedly committed to that\nprinciple."

You may\nsafely count on my delegation\u2019s full support in the\ndischarge of your important responsibilities.\nHungary is firmly committed to effective\nmultilateralism as a key tool of its foreign policy. Well-\nfunctioning international organizations and institutions\nhaving broad political support in the international\ncommunity can and should, indeed, play a significant\nrole in addressing the challenges of our globalized\nworld.\nWe are looking forward with eager expectation to\nthe outcome of the work of the High-Level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change, set up by the\n23\n\nSecretary-General, to be finalized later this year.\nAddressing the complex and difficult tasks that we are\nfacing today needs not only strong political will on the\npart of all of us, but also an improved and adapted\nmultilateral framework of cooperation.\nOnly a system of international institutions whose\nactivities and form of operation are renewed and\nadjusted to the realities of our contemporary world can\nbe effective as an instrument in addressing successfully\nthe threats and challenges.\nHungary remains strongly committed to making\nthe United Nations more effective. To this end, the\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, must\nadapt to the changing circumstances of the political\nlandscape.\nNew and emerging threats, including\ninternational terrorism, the danger of the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction and their means of\ndelivery, transnational organized crime and failing\nStates are all grave menaces. The role played by\nMember States in prevention and early warning should\ntherefore be stronger than ever. These challenges are\nglobal or regional in nature and, in our view, the\nresponse to them must be at the same level. Without\nsuch enhanced cooperation among the members of the\ninternational community, all efforts are doomed to be\nfruitless.\nHeinous acts of terrorism such as those that\ncaused immense human suffering in New York,\nWashington, D.C., Bali, Istanbul, Madrid and, recently,\nthe Russian Federation, should be considered brutal\nattacks against the values of democracies. By putting\ninnocent lives at risk, they also seek to undermine the\nopenness and tolerance of our societies.\nAlong with our partners in the European Union,\nHungary strongly condemns all forms of terrorism. In\nthis regard, we fully support the important work of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee. We\nhope that its reinvigorated activity, including planned\nvisits by the Committee to Member States, will\ncontribute to the enhancement of our capabilities in\ncombating terrorism. It is of the utmost importance to\nprovide assistance in strengthening the preparedness of\nthose countries that are eager to tackle the menace\noriginating from their territory.\nSubstantial work has been undertaken on freezing\nfunds and financial resources to prevent the financing\nof terrorism. The United Nations has to continue to be\na key player in that fight. To achieve real and tangible\nresults in that regard, we have to ensure full\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions and the accession of the largest possible\nnumber of States to international conventions and\nprotocols to combat terrorism. Hungary has done its\npart to that end.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nand their means of delivery continues to be a clear and\npresent threat to international peace and security. New\ndiscoveries of large-scale nuclear-weapon programmes,\nnetworks of illicit trafficking in nuclear material and\ntechnology and the ill-conceived policies of denial and\ndeceit about the purpose and nature of such\nprogrammes remain a most serious concern to the\ninternational community. There is a growing\nrecognition, shared by Hungary, that those programmes\nalso represent the most serious risks of proliferation.\nThe danger of nuclear, biological and chemical\nweapons falling into the hands of rogue States, terrorist\ngroups or, for that matter, any other non-State actors\nthat menace our world, gives rise to new, major\nsecurity challenges. In that regard, we must act\ntogether in a decisive manner, both regionally and\nglobally.\nIn that respect, Hungary strongly supports the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540\n(2004), which calls on all States to establish effective\nnational export controls. We urge full implementation\nof that resolution and are prepared to assist others in\ndoing so.\nIn our fast-changing world security environment,\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) is and should remain the cornerstone\nof the universal non-proliferation regime. Along with\nour European Union partners, we are committed to\nsafeguarding the Treaty\u2019s authority and integrity. In\nthat context, we are looking forward to the Seventh\nReview Conference of the NPT next year.\nWe should continue our efforts in the field of\nconflict prevention and post-conflict crisis\nmanagement. For millions of people in conflict areas,\nthose efforts mean hope for peace and a better, more\nsecure future.\nWe are confident that the joint efforts of the Iraqi\npeople and the international community will lead to a\ndemocratic and prosperous Iraq living in peace with\n24\n\nitself and its neighbours. Hungary strongly condemns\nthe terrorist acts and the kidnappings aimed at\nundermining the political and reconstruction process in\nthat much-suffering country. The contribution of the\nUnited Nations is essential for success. Our\nOrganization has already proven to be effective in\nadvancing the political process when it seemed to have\ncome to a standstill.\nHungary continues to contribute, along with\ncoalition forces, to the stabilization and the\nimprovement of security conditions in Iraq. We deem it\nimportant that relevant international organizations and\ninstitutions increase their joint efforts towards that end,\nincluding through the training of Iraqi security\npersonnel.\nAt this moment, our priorities in Iraq must be to\nassist preparations for the national elections and the\ndrafting of a new constitution. Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) provides a key role for the\nUnited Nations in the political transition process. Its\nample experience in establishing democratic\ninstitutions, the rule of law, the promotion of respect\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms and\nelectoral assistance can and should be utilized.\nHungary views the potentially successful\nrealization of the presidential and the subsequent\nparliamentary elections in Afghanistan as important\nsteps towards the normalization of the political\nsituation in that country. We welcome the fact that\ndespite unsatisfactory security conditions, progress is\nbeing made on preparations for the presidential\nelections to be held in October this year.\nHungary is deeply concerned about the continued\nviolence in the Middle East, where substantial progress\nis yet to be achieved. We remain convinced that full\nand unconditional implementation of the road map\noffers the best chance for the parties directly involved\nto live side by side in peace and security. We urge all\ninvolved, including the Quartet, to redouble their\nefforts to that end.\nThe situation in the Balkans continues to remain\nat the centre of our attention. Overall developments in\nthe region and the efforts of the international\ncommunity have resulted in a calm but fragile political\nenvironment. In that respect, Hungary is committed to\nmaintaining its presence in the international missions,\nin the service of peace and stability, in that region\nwhich is so close to us.\nIn that connection, we are following with serious\nconcern the deterioration of the human rights situation\nin our immediate neighbourhood \u2014 in Serbia and\nMontenegro. It is particularly alarming that the number\nof incidents perpetrated against the non-Serb\npopulation, including the Hungarian community, is on\nthe rise. Hungary once again calls upon the Serbian\nauthorities to take the necessary measures to stop and\nto prevent those violent acts, as well as to identify,\nprosecute and punish the perpetrators of serious crimes\nof physical abuse, as well as psychological threats and\nintimidation. We are looking forward to the results of\nthe international monitoring currently under way.\nInternational protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms is at the core of the foreign\npolicy of Hungary. It is not only an expression of\nsupport for the universal values we feel so close to our\nhearts. It is also an essential prerequisite for preserving\nhuman dignity and enhancing liberty in our\ncontemporary world. Freedom of the individual and\nfull respect for the rights of human beings are matters\nwell above the authority of any given State.\nIn today\u2019s world, we could hardly find a country\nwhere everyone speaks the same language or shares the\nsame culture, beliefs and traditions. The presence of\ndifferent national, ethnic, linguistic and religious\ngroups within the borders of a country is not only an\nasset but also a source of social and cultural\nenrichment. It is our firm belief that the United\nNations, as the most comprehensive multilateral\norganization, has a major role to play in the promotion\nof respect for, and the observance of, human rights,\nincluding the rights of national minorities.\nAgainst that background, the international\ncommunity should continue to examine all possible\nways to promote and establish an early-warning\nmechanism or a monitoring body dealing with\nminority-related situations. That should include the\noptions of nominating a Special Rapporteur on\nminorities and elaborating a legally binding universal\ndocument to address shortcomings.\nNext year, with a major event, will be particularly\nimportant for the United Nations. In the course of\naddressing the burning issues on our agenda, we have\nto take a long, hard look at our tasks, including the\nreview of the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration, adopted by heads of State and\nGovernment in 2000. In our view, the review exercise\n25\n\nrequires careful preparation, vision, political\ndetermination and the courage to act. Hungary is ready\nand willing to take part in this process."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I would\nlike to begin by congratulating you upon your election\nto your challenging office. Under your able guidance,\nthe Assembly will take forward its relentless pursuit of\npeace, security and prosperity throughout the world. I\ncan assure you of Greece\u2019s unwavering support in your\nefforts. Our thanks go also to the outgoing president,\nMr. Julian Hunte, for his exemplary efforts and\nachievements in revitalizing the work of the General\nAssembly, as well as on many other issues.\nThe Greek Government fully subscribes to the\nstatement delivered two days ago by the Foreign\nMinister of the Netherlands on behalf of the European\nUnion (EU) (see ), as well as to the EU\npriorities presented to this General Assembly.\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century,\nevents of great importance changed the world we live\nin. From the most shocking tragedy of 11 September\n2001 to the bombing attacks in Madrid and the recent\nacts of unspeakable brutality in Beslan, a dark parade\nof acts of blind violence has caused immense human\nsuffering.\nThis has increased our responsibility and cemented\nour will to work in solidarity for a safer, fairer world.\nFighting international terrorism has become the most\npressing task among our priorities. In that fight, we\nmust prevail. Besides the scourge of terrorism,\nhowever, there are many other challenges and grave\nproblems that afflict humanity. The proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, human trafficking,\norganized crime, failing States, environmental\ncatastrophes, social and economic crises, pandemic\ndiseases, large-scale humanitarian disasters, hunger\nand poverty constitute the core problems we have to\nface in solidarity regardless of our geography, culture\nor religion.\nLast year, the Secretary-General announced the\ncreation of a High-Level Panel of eminent persons to\nassess the new threats and challenges and to suggest\nways to deal with them, including through reform of\nthe multilateral international system. We fully support\nthose efforts. We are eager to contribute constructively,\nto the best of our ability, towards making the United\nNations as effective as possible for the twenty-first\ncentury.\n(spoke in French)\nThe major challenges and threats confronting us\nare a source of profound concern \u2014 for us and for the\npeoples we represent. Nonetheless, it is my conviction\nthat, at any cost, we must avoid being drawn into\npessimism and anxiety about the future. I share with\nmillions of people worldwide the hope, optimism and\ndetermination that were recently seen during the\nOlympic and Paralympic Games in Athens.\nIn Athens, athletes of the world devoted their\nefforts to a noble cause and showed us that competition\ndoes not necessarily mean tension, friction, crisis or\nconflict. To the contrary, they proved that the\naspirations of all sides can not only coexist peacefully\nbut can also lead to a strengthening of friendship,\nsolidarity and cooperation among individuals and\nnations.\nThe ancient ideal of the Olympic Truce embodies\nmodern humanity\u2019s hope for the peaceful settlement of\nthe conflicts ravaging the world. The General\nAssembly has, on many occasions, unanimously\nendorsed the Olympic Truce and has appealed to\nMember States to respect it during the Games. It is\nnow a question of transforming that appeal into a\ntangible reality.\n(spoke in English)\nMultilateral cooperation is the safest way to a\nbetter world. We all should contribute to the\nenhancement and effectiveness of the international\nmultilateral system. In that context, Greece fully shares\nthe view of the Secretary-General that we have to\n25\n\nmove rapidly from the existing culture of reaction to\none of prevention.\nThe peaceful resolution of all disputes at an early\nstage, on the basis of the United Nations Charter, is of\nfundamental importance to my country. We strongly\nbelieve that the United Nations system of conflict\nprevention and its preventive potential should be\nfurther enhanced to respond better to future challenges.\nPeace and development are two mutually\nreinforcing sides of the same coin. Persistent poverty\ncheats nations out of progress and provides a breeding\nground for both internal and regional crises. Four years\nago, with the adoption of the Millennium Declaration,\na landmark decision was taken to embark upon long-\nterm global evolution. We committed ourselves to\nachieve by the year 2015 the Goals that were set. It\nwould be a disgrace to mankind if we did not succeed\nin bringing about stable and sustainable development\nand in eradicating hunger and poverty.\nHowever, there are growing indications that,\ndespite some progress, we are lagging in fulfilling\nagreed targets. Collectively, we have to explore new,\ninnovative ways of financing development. Particular\nattention should be paid to the development problems\nof Africa and of small island States.\nIn line with the Millennium Declaration, and\ndespite the enormous outlay of resources necessary to\nfinance the Olympic Games and their security, Greece\nhas made a point of increasing its development\nassistance.\nIn the context of that effort, Greece welcomes the\nproposals to combat hunger and poverty made by the\nPresident of Brazil and co-sponsored by France, Chile,\nArgentina and Spain. We shall continue to work\ntowards a constructive and effective system that will\nallow smooth cooperation between recipients and\ndonors and between developing and developed\ncountries.\nA close look at Greece\u2019s immediate\nneighbourhood reveals that, despite the considerable\nprogress made over the last few years, the situation\nstill remains fragile in parts of the western Balkans.\nUnemployment and the lack of economic prospects are\nin some cases a social and political time bomb. The\nsituation in Kosovo remains a source of instability.\nWith the proactive support and involvement of\nthe international community, we are working hard to\ntransform the Balkans into a region of democracy, peace,\nstability and prosperity, focused on a common European\nfuture. We believe that genuinely regional initiatives\nsuch as the South-East European Cooperation Process\nconstitute the appropriate vehicle to enable\nparticipating countries to coordinate their efforts\ntowards reform, progress and good neighbourliness.\nIn recent years, the climate of our bilateral\nrelations with Turkey has been constantly improving.\nBoth the Greek and the Turkish Governments have\nundertaken sincere efforts to set bilateral relations on a\nnew track. We note with satisfaction the progress\nachieved so far in certain areas of our bilateral\ncooperation and express our determination to expand it\nfurther. It is in that spirit that we clearly support\nTurkey\u2019s European perspective.\nIn Cyprus, reunification remains our unwavering\ngoal through a mutually agreed, lasting, fair and\nfunctional settlement, based on the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions and the plan of the Secretary-\nGeneral and compatible with the European Union\nCommunity acquis and European Union principles.\nDuring the last 30 years of military occupation of\nmore than one third of the territory of Cyprus, Greece\nhas strongly supported every attempt and initiative by\nthe United Nations, including the most recent one, for\nthe achievement of a just, viable and functional\nsolution of the Cyprus problem. Unfortunately, the last\nround of talks did not lead to an agreed comprehensive\nsolution. In the referendum, which followed in April,\nan overwhelming majority of Greek Cypriots rejected a\nspecific version of the Annan plan, but they still deeply\ncherish the goal of a reunited island.\nThe international community can contribute\ndecisively in that direction by keeping the window for\na solution open and by avoiding any action which\ncould lead to the deepening of the division of the island\nor could fail to provide incentives for its reunification.\nThe horizon over the Middle East remains dark.\nThe Greek Government is convinced that only the\nimplementation of the road map can lead to the two-\nState solution: Israel and Palestine coexisting in peace\nand security. Half measures can only complicate\nmatters and add new sources of tension. Essential\nprogress in the peace process cannot be achieved\nwithout a comprehensive cessation of all kinds of\nviolence, especially violence directed against civilians.\nTerrorism cannot be a weapon to achieve political\n26\n\ngoals, and terrorist attacks cannot be justified by any\nmeans.\nAs to Iraq, we are deeply committed to the\nterritorial integrity and unity of the country in a federal\nsystem. We are deeply worried by the ongoing violence,\nand we hope for progress in the political process, which\nwill lead to a stable and prosperous democratic\ncountry, allowing all of its citizens to enjoy the fruits\nof peace and exploit the country\u2019s enormous potential.\n(spoke in French)\nIn the light of the great challenges on the African\ncontinent, we note with great satisfaction the\ndedication shown and the results achieved by the\nAfrican Union, an organization that is only 3 years old.\nGreece and its European partners want to help to improve\nAfrica\u2019s prospects through development assistance,\nhumanitarian assistance and logistical support.\nMoreover, we support the prospect of strengthened\npolitical cooperation with African countries and with\nthe continent\u2019s regional organizations.\nI take this opportunity to express the\ncongratulations of my Government and of the Greek\npeople on the tenth anniversary of the establishment of\ndemocracy in the Republic of South Africa, a historic\nevent of pan-African significance.\n(spoke in English)\nMy country has applied for a non-permanent seat\non the Security Council for the period 2005-2006. I\nwish to express our deep appreciation to the members\nof the Group of Western European and other States for\ntheir endorsement. Elections are taking place in a few\nweeks\u2019 time. We are asking for the support of the\nAssembly, which we would greatly appreciate. Let me\nassure Members that we shall respect its mandate and\nthat we remain strongly committed to contributing\nconstructively to the maintenance of peace and security\nand to the preservation of the multilateral order.\nGreece remains completely devoted to the\npromotion of democratic principles of government, the\npeaceful resolution of disputes, strict adherence to\ninternational law and respect for human rights. We are\ndetermined, should we be elected, to devote all our\nefforts and all our capacity to fulfilling that\nresponsibility and honouring the trust of this Assembly\nof all nations."

        "file_text": "I would like to join previous\nspeakers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for his\nexemplary stewardship of the Assembly during his\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session.\nAt the Millennium Summit, Member States\ncommitted themselves to a shared vision of global\nsolidarity and common security. We reaffirmed our\nfaith in the United Nations and its Charter as\nindispensable for a more peaceful, secure and just\nworld. As we have entered the new century we have\ndone our best to maintain the vital importance of\ninternational law, so that all countries may be able to\ncount on the Organization in their hour of need and so\nthat, in turn, the United Nations can fulfil what the\nworld expects from it.\nSome of our actions sought to protect millions of\ninnocent people, especially women and children, who\nstill fall victim to brutal armed conflicts. Others\nendeavoured to establish a more equitable world\neconomy, where all countries must have equal chances\nat fair competition.\nAzerbaijan is making its own contribution to the\nstrengthening of global and regional security. As an active\nmember of the global coalition against international\nterrorism, Azerbaijan is faithfully cooperating,\nbilaterally and within multilateral frameworks, to\nsuppress this evil that continues to bring death and\nsuffering to innocent peoples. Azerbaijan is among the\ncountries that have suffered directly from the\nconsequences of armed conflicts on its territory. In\nreality those conflicts are interlinked, and we have no\nother choice but to face them in cooperation and unity.\nThere should be no room for double standards.\nSince the very day it became a member of the\nUnited Nations, Azerbaijan has constantly drawn the\nattention of the international community to the conflict\n7\n\nbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-\nKarabakh and to the occupation by Armenia of\nAzerbaijani territories. Azerbaijan expected the United\nNations to compel the aggressor to move out of its land\nand to allow the expelled Azerbaijani population to\nreturn to their homes. I should like to recall that, in\n1993, the Security Council unanimously adopted four\nresolutions \u2014 resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874\n(1993) and 884 (1993) \u2014 in response to Armenia\u2019s\noccupation of sovereign Azerbaijani territories.\nThose resolutions confirmed that the region of\nNagorno-Karabakh was part of Azerbaijan, resolutely\ncalled for respect for the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Azerbaijan and its internationally\nrecognized borders, and underlined the inadmissibility of\nthe use of force for the purpose of acquiring territory.\nThe resolutions demanded an immediate, complete and\nunconditional withdrawal of occupying forces from all\noccupied areas of Azerbaijan and called for the\nestablishment of conditions for the safe return of\ndisplaced people to their places of permanent residence.\nNone of those resolutions \u2014 which were intended\nto restore justice and peace and the territorial integrity\nof Azerbaijan \u2014 has been implemented by Armenia,\nwhich never respected or recognized the fundamental\nprinciples of international law contained in the\nresolutions that laid down the basis for the settlement\nof the conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other\nregions of Azerbaijan, which make up 20 per cent of\nthe territory of Azerbaijan, have been occupied by\nArmenia for more than 10 years. As a result of the\npolicy of ethnic cleansing conducted by Armenia, more\nthan 1 million of Azerbaijan\u2019s people have become\nrefugees or internally displaced persons.\nThe silence of the Security Council has had a\ndevastating impact on the resettlement process.\nArmenia has ignored the resolutions and has attempted\nto consolidate the results of its military aggression \u2014\nand it has not been punished for it. Armenia\nconsequently launched an outrageous policy involving\nmassive illegal settlement of an Armenian population\nin occupied Azerbaijani territories. That also is a\nblatant violation of international law, and in particular\nof the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.\nMoreover, the situation has deteriorated, with those\nterritories being used for drug trafficking, arms\ntransfers, the harbouring of terrorists, illegal economic\nactivities and smuggling. The occupied Azerbaijani\nterritories have become a kind of grey zone out of the\ncontrol of Azerbaijan\u2019s Government and free from any\ninternational monitoring.\nThe self-proclaimed, non-recognized so-called\nNagorno-Karabakh republic is a constant threat to\npeace and security in the whole region. Armenian\naggressors and Nagorno-Karabakh separatists are also\nexploiting natural resources in the occupied\nAzerbaijani territories and are attempting to engage\noverseas companies in their illegal business. I call\nupon Member States to take all necessary measures to\nmake their nationals and companies respect\ninternational law and to prevent them from illegal\nactivities on the territory of our country. For its part,\nAzerbaijan will undertake all necessary legal and\npractical measures to hold those companies\naccountable for participation in the stealing of the\nnatural wealth belonging to a sovereign nation.\nFurthermore, Armenia is falsifying history and\nmisappropriating the cultural and architectural heritage\nof the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.\nReligious and historical monuments, ancient\nmanuscripts and other cultural properties have been\ndestroyed, refashioned, plundered or removed.\nThe process of political settlement of the conflict\nthat has been conducted within the Minsk Group of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) during the last 12 years has thus far yielded no\nresults. No serious consideration has been given by the\nMinsk Group to the implementation of the Security\nCouncil\u2019s resolutions, to assessing the situation on the\nground or to the illegal activities carried out by\nArmenia in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.\nIt is obvious that, under the current passive and\nsilent attitude of the United Nations, the Security\nCouncil, the OSCE and the Minsk Group, and without\nstrong pressure from the international community,\nArmenia will not abandon its aggressive and\ndestructive stance. The illegal actions of Armenia in\noccupied Azerbaijani territories and its position in the\nnegotiating process prove that Armenia is not intent on\nfinding a solution to the problem. Rather, it intends to\nfurther prolong the negotiations and to consolidate the\nresults of its aggression, while trying ultimately to\nimpose a fait-accompli-based settlement.\nI wish to stress from this podium that a settlement\nof this issue must be based only on international law\nand democracy, not on ethnic cleansing and the de\n8\n\nfacto annexation of the territory of a sovereign State.\nAzerbaijan will never accept the occupation of its\nterritory, the violation of its territorial integrity or the\nresults of ethnic cleansing.\nThe return of Azerbaijan\u2019s displaced population\nto their homes remains one of our key priorities in the\nprocess of settling the conflict. But even before our\nexpelled people, refugees and internally displaced\npersons come back home, there is still an urgent need\nfor all the relevant United Nations agencies, donor\ncountries and international humanitarian organizations\nto be actively involved in addressing the suffering of\nthe most affected part of population.\nThe Government of Azerbaijan does not spare\ntime, effort or financial resources to do its part; but\ngiven the scale of displacement, that is not sufficient.\nBurden-sharing between the Government and relevant\ninternational organizations is crucial. In addition to\npurely material support, we also request a renewal of\ninternational attention to the problem and better\ncoordination on the part of the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies, as well as efforts by all international\norganizations. We expect a more responsive strategy by\nthe United Nations with regard to the state of the\nforgotten humanitarian crisis in Azerbaijan.\nAzerbaijan is fully committed to the objectives of\npoverty eradication and to the promotion of good\ngovernance. On that basis, and as a result of the\nmeasures we have undertaken, we are currently seeing\nincreased economic performance and growth.\nAzerbaijan is making its contribution to the\ndevelopment of transregional cooperation. We are also\npromoting such transportation and communication\nnetworks as the Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus\nAsia project and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-\nTbilisi-Erzerum oil and gas pipelines. Those projects\nwill ensure predictable access for the exports of land-\nlocked countries to world and regional markets.\nThe United Nations has to adapt itself in order to\nsuccessfully tackle all the challenges it faces. The\nlong-standing issue of United Nations reform needs\nfinally to be resolved. The inability of the Security\nCouncil to cope with problems, and particularly those\nrelated to armed conflicts, is obvious. The new\nSecurity Council should be more representative,\nresponsible and democratic. Its working methods must\nbe more transparent and able to respond more rapidly\nto the new challenges, risks and threats of the twenty-\nfirst century. Developing viable mechanisms for the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions is also\na pressing issue.\nIt is the obligation of all of us to collectively\napply effective approaches to current problems,\nthereby enabling a stable environment for the\nsustainable growth and democratic development of\nnations. That can only be achieved through\nstrengthening the norms and principles of international\nlaw and through friendly relations and mutually\nbeneficial cooperation among States."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I\nextend to you my sincere congratulations on your\nunanimous election to guide the work of this fifty-ninth\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. We\nare convinced that the wealth of diplomatic experience\nand expertise you bring to this body will assist you in a\nmeaningful way during your presidency. I can assure\nyou that the Government of the Republic of Suriname\nand its Permanent Mission stand ready to cooperate\nwith you in the coming months. It also gives me great\npleasure to salute your predecessor, the President of the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly,\nMr. Julian Robert Hunte, a fellow Caribbean national.\nMr. Hunte\u2019s sterling and dedicated leadership has made\nall of us, especially those from the Caribbean region,\nproud. To Secretary-General Kofi Annan we offer our\ncontinued support. We acknowledge the importance of\nhis remarks at the start of the General Assembly and\nshare his views regarding the application of the rule of\nlaw, both domestically and internationally, as the\nguiding principle in strengthening and preserving\ndemocracy, defending and promoting human rights and\nestablishing peace.\nWe are keenly aware of the importance of the\nUnited Nations, as the supreme multilateral institution,\nin advancing multilateral diplomacy for the benefit of\nhumanity in a world in which we continue to struggle\nto achieve peace, security and prosperity. The\ninternational community expressed some time ago the\nneed for a more effective and efficient Organization\nthat would be better able to address the many\nchallenges our world faces today.\nUnder the inspiring leadership of your\npredecessor, Mr. President, the fifty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly achieved the reordering of the\nagenda of the General Assembly aimed at its further\nrationalization and at facilitating the uniform and\ncoherent discussion of development issues in the\nplenary and the main committees of the General\nAssembly. We must keep that powerful momentum for\nchange alive and take it a step further. We must ensure\nthat we do not regress from the results achieved and\nensure that there is continued progress in these areas.\nThe reform of the United Nations Security\nCouncil remains one of the vital objectives of the\nrestructuring efforts of the Organization. In our view, a\nrestructured Council must be a reflection of the\nmembership of the Organization, improving its level of\ntransparency and making it more democratic. The\nCouncil must be more inclusive and comprehensive in\nits functioning, as security matters, because of their\nmultidimensional nature, affect the life and livelihood\nof each and every one of us. The membership of a\nrestructured Council and, equally, its current\ncomposition must ensure that the Council upholds the\nfundamental principles of the Charter while retaining\nits main focus: the maintenance of international peace\nand security.\nIt is very disturbing to observe that, despite\nintensive diplomatic and political undertakings, peace\nand tranquillity in several regions of the world are still\na major concern and challenge that threaten the\ndemocratic underpinnings of society. The time may be\nopportune for the United Nations to spearhead the\nprocess of involving relevant interest groups and civil\nsociety at large in the different countries of a particular\nregion to assist in the establishment of sustained peace\nin that region.\n12\n\nWe express our concern about the ongoing\npolitical difficulties in the Middle East and in Africa,\nresulting in violence and the displacement of many\npersons.\nThe political crises in our own hemisphere \u2014\nespecially in Venezuela and Haiti \u2014 have attracted\nmuch attention and have been the subject of many\nefforts by the United Nations and the Organization of\nAmerican States. We look forward to continuing and\nsustainable political stability in Venezuela which, we\nhope, will promote an environment of normalcy and\nprogress.\nThe political situation in our sister nation, the\nRepublic of Haiti, remains of great concern. Since its\ninception as the first black independent republic, Haiti\nhas become the symbol of struggle and hardship, but\nalso of courage, survival and solidarity. That long-\nbattered country and its population need more\nprofound, constructive and long-term assistance to\nimprove the living conditions of the people of Haiti.\nEarlier, I referred briefly to the multidimensional\nnature of security and the need to give due attention to\nsocial, economic and environmental threats. In recent\nweeks, the Caribbean region, which is home to\neconomies that are already vulnerable, has felt the\nforce of nature in the most extreme manner. While\nseveral countries have been battered \u2014 such as\nJamaica, the Bahamas, Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and\nseveral other islands \u2014 one country in particular has\nbeen severely damaged: Grenada. I join all the other\nnations that have already done so in calling for\nimmediate as well as long-term financial and technical\nassistance for the Government and people of Grenada.\nThe Government of Suriname offers it condolences to\nthe families of the victims in Caribbean countries, as\nwell as in affected states of the United States of\nAmerica, where various hurricanes in recent weeks\nhave caused considerable damage and loss of life.\nAnother global threat that has an impact on every\ncountry emanates from the activities of terrorists,\nterrorist groups and State-sponsored terrorism. The\nworld will never forget the images of horrifying\nterrorist acts such as the one that took place in Beslan\nthis year, where hundreds of persons, mostly children,\nlost their lives. The Government of Suriname remains\ncommitted to the fight against terrorism. We also\ncontinue to believe that an effective and successful\nbattle can be waged through a comprehensive\napproach.\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange, which was established by the Secretary-\nGeneral with a view to receiving a global report on\ninternational security, is a result of the renewed interest\nin international security concerns. We hope that that\nreview will be one that will produce result-oriented\nobjectives and measures.\nSuriname believes that development issues such\nas the eradication of poverty and hunger and the\nprotection of the environment are among the extremely\nimportant aspects to be addressed if one wishes to\nobtain lasting and comprehensive security, which\nencompasses, inter alia, military, political,\nenvironmental, economic and social developmental\naspects.\nUp to the present day, globalization has not\ndelivered on the promise of vast development\nopportunities on a global scale. While we have to\nacknowledge that globalization has created\nopportunities, those opportunities have been restricted\nto just a few societies. The opportunities that arise\nfrom development in the world today are,\nunfortunately, not within the reach of all humankind.\nThe current world order is still characterized by\neconomic disparities, unequal trade regimes, income\ninequalities between and within countries, social\ninjustice and declining opportunities for hundreds of\nmillions. Globalization can only become a real option\nfor economic development if it becomes all-inclusive\nand if we give it a human face by paying particular\nattention to the negative impact it has on social\nprogress.\nSuriname continues to believe that the United\nNations must regain its importance in the areas of\nglobal development, if we want to be successful in our\nefforts to eradicate poverty, achieve social and\neconomic development and stem the spread of\ncommunicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\nThe meeting on the subject of poverty organized\nby the Government of Brazil under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations points to a common awareness of the\nfact that the global development agenda must be\nadvanced and that, therefore, the international\ncommunity must move from political will to action and\nfrom commitments to implementation, granting\nhumanity as a whole an opportunity to develop.\n13\n\nThe upcoming 10-year review of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action will provide small island\ndeveloping States with a momentous opportunity to\npromote their priority interests and concerns for the\nnext phase of the implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action. While we anticipate that that\ncomprehensive review will result in concrete proposals\nto advance the implementation process, we also expect\nthat the review exercise will take place in a spirit of\npartnership. The upcoming meeting in Mauritius\nshould therefore generate greatly needed support,\ngenuine commitment and, moreover, the political will\nof all partners in the process of furthering the cause of\nachieving true benefits and progress for the many\npeople living in small island developing States.\nIn conclusion, I want to stress the need for the\nUnited Nations to become more effective in dealing\nwith the current challenges in terms of terrorism and\nsecurity. At the same time, we must remain vigilant in\ndefending and strengthening democracy and\ndemocratic values and institutions, so as to create a\nstable political and social environment for progress and\nsustainable development. We also need to continue,\nand intensify, our battle against HIV/AIDS, illegal drug\ntrafficking and crime. Although globalization has\nopened up opportunities, it is also our collective\nresponsibility to ensure that international trade\nliberalization does not result in social and economic\nmarginalization, especially of smaller and vulnerable\neconomies.\nTo achieve those objectives, the United Nations\nhas to continue its restructuring process and become\nnot only the principal global platform in theory, but\nalso demonstrate its capabilities to act in practice. It is\nin that context that my Government considers the\nUnited Nations the most appropriate global multilateral\ninstitution for the advancement of the living standards\nof humankind as a whole and for achieving sustainable\nglobal peace and security."

When we look at the\nimpressive success achieved by the United Nations\nsince San Francisco in 1944, two things seem clear.\nFirst, the institutions that we have created\nrepresent the greatest and most successful effort ever\nmade by mankind to organize peaceful coexistence and\nto endow the planet with the best possible instruments\nfor dealing with the important aspects of human lives\nwithin human society.\nSecondly, it is equally clear that the world has\nchanged so much that the current reality now far\nexceeds the capacity of the institutions that were\ncreated to address and resolve past issues, issues that\ntoday have taken on totally different characteristics.\nSuffice it to recall that the founding Members of the\nUnited Nations numbered 51 and that today there are\n191 Member States. More important, the world\u00eds\npopulation at that time was only half what it is today.\nAnd the total is inexorably rising towards 9 billion.\nFurthermore, over the past 40 years, scientific\nadvances and the ensuing technological applications have\nincreased the resources of a very small group of nations,\nleaving far behind many other countries, some of which\nonly recently gained their independence and most of\nwhich are rich in natural resources but lack the basic\nstructures needed to achieve sustainable growth -\ncountries, moreover, where, no doubt as a consequence\nof this, the population is increasing at very high rates\nand where the resulting emigration to other continents\nwill soon create serious problems of coexistence.\nUruguay has been a Member of the United\nNations since its foundation and believes in the\nOrganization and in the varied multilateral agencies\nthat support its efforts; we understand the need to\nconsider Charter revision so that nations that did not\nthen carry the weight they carry today can assume\ngreater obligations in the inescapable tasks that the\nsituation of mankind now imposes on us. It is time for\nthem to share the responsibility with the five nations\nthat assumed it nearly 60 years ago.\nUruguay has also been participating in\npeacekeeping operations for many years. Uruguay is one\nof the largest troop contributors, and is the very largest\nif the ratio of its small population - 3.4 million - to\npeacekeepers is taken into consideration. We have\nparticipated in operations in Asia and in Africa, and we\nare currently deployed in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, Haiti, Eritrea and elsewhere.\nUruguay acknowledges and welcomes the wise\nEuropean Union effort to bring equality at the highest\nlevel to European nations with marked differences in\nincome compared with the richest countries. The\nexamples of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece,\nwhich will surely be emulated for new European Union\nmembers, indicate what we in the United Nations must\ndo for the Congo and Haiti.\nThere is no point in achieving peace if the United\nNations lacks funds that can immediately be spent for the\npractical benefit of peoples in extreme economic\ndifficulties. We must create global and largely\nautonomous financial instruments to achieve those goals.\nThat is the only way for the United Nations to succeed.\nA tiny nation like Haiti \u00f3 of 27,000 square\nkilometres and 9 million inhabitants, where the average\nnumber of children per mother is 4.7 and which lacks\nthe institutional and material infrastructure it needs -\ncannot and will not resolve its problems merely\nbecause a contingent of military forces from countries\nof the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) is\nkeeping the peace.\nTravelling in the Congo with the troops we\nrecently dispatched, we see exactly the same thing\nhappening: a nation of 2.2 million square kilometres\nand a population of 50 million does not have a road\ngoing from one end of the country to the other. Without\nautonomous, ready and independent means of coping\nwith and transforming that state of affairs, the United\nNations will not have solved anything at all even five,\n10, 15 or 20 years from now. Yet only the United\nNations can handle such tasks.\nJust more than three years since the fateful day of\n11 September 2001 and just over six months since the\ntragedy in Madrid, new and terrible forms of violence\ncontinue assailing other parts of the world, claiming\nhundreds of innocent victims \u00f3 as we have recently seen\nin Russia and as we see in the Middle East. This reveals\nthe destructive power that poses a permanent threat to the\nworld as a whole, a source of inescapable sadness and\na cause for despair about the human condition itself.\nTerrorism - and a genuine commitment to\ncombat and defeat it - must therefore be the first item\n10\n\non our international agenda. Each State, each nation, each\ncommunity and each human being must contribute to\nthis endeavour; that is how we can help the United\nNations to fulfil its role as universal guarantor.\nCombating this and other evils - hunger, poverty,\nunderdevelopment, marginalization, exclusion - requires\na United Nations that is more united, nimbler and more\neffective. That is why the Organization must be more\nrepresentative, more balanced and more reliable: so\nthat it can continue to be a reference point for the weak\nand a restraining influence on the strong.\nHere, our country has recently adopted legislation\nstrengthening the system of prevention and control of\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism. We\nare in compliance with nearly all current treaties in this\narea, and our legislation improves our mechanisms for\ninternational cooperation against money laundering\nand the financing of terrorism.\nAt the Millennium Summit and in the Doha\nDeclaration and Monterrey Consensus we agreed on\nprinciples, goals and priorities, and we made\ncommitments which we reaffirmed a few days ago at\nthe summit of world leaders for the Action Against\nHunger and Poverty. If we are to attain those goals, we\nneed more just and equitable rules of international\ntrade. That is how to ensure that this becomes a key\nstage in the march towards the social and political\nstability that is today in serious jeopardy.\nThis is particularly important since it is well\nknown that States that vociferously preach free trade\nand demand open markets \u00f3 which in our case are\nalready entirely open \u00f3 themselves impose and institute\nobstacles to trade, subsidize their production in distorting\nways and compete with countries such as mine and many\nothers, which have nothing to offer the world except the\nlabour of their people in the commodity and industrial\nsectors, which further enriches the rich countries.\nUruguay attaches fundamental importance to\nfinancial and trade issues. In all international forums,\nUruguay calls for freer, more open markets. We favour\na single market from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego; we\nsupport the Doha Agreement; we support the opening\nof markets. We believe in freedom, but we believe also\nthat freedom is indivisible: there can be no political\nfreedom without economic freedom, and we think there\ncan be no economic freedom that does not go hand in\nhand with political freedom.\nWe believe, therefore, that peoples can be strong\nonly if they can create their future in freedom. We\ncannot build and stabilize democracies if women and\nmen cannot find an honest job to which to devote their\nenergies. That goal cannot be achieved with economic\nassistance alone or with loans that, in the poorest\ncountries, are paid back only with great difficulty. It\ncan be brought about only with free trade \u00f3 something\nthat the world experienced in the nineteenth century.\nIn conclusion, Uruguay will continue to be\ncommitted to the international system and to the\nprogressive development of international law, the most\nrecent expression of which was the establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court, whose Statute we\nhave ratified. We reaffirm our conviction that\nmultilateralism is the main principle on which the\nconduct of international affairs must be based. We\nexpress the hope that our region and the world as a\nwhole will pool their efforts and work together in a\nrealistic and committed manner. We continue to believe\nin the United Nations as the collective instrument best\nsuited to our search for peace."

        "file_text": "I wish to\nbegin by warmly congratulating Mr. Jean Ping,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, on his election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session. I wish also to extend my country\u2019s\nthanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nthe powerful and inspiring words he spoke yesterday\n(see ).\nThousands of my compatriots are today suffering\nunder the blows of nature. Floods of a kind never\nbefore seen have brought grief to many families. The\nentire country has turned to the victims in a truly\nmoving display of solidarity. With my heart in Panama\nwith the victims and their families, I have come to the\nUnited Nations, because the tragedy unfolding in my\ncountry highlights more than ever the need to tackle\nthe problem of poverty urgently.\nThe United Nations was conceived as a way of\npreventing war and restoring peace. Today, all the\ncountries of the world have to be able to feel that they\ncan come to the United Nations to solve their problems\nand not just to discuss them. If that is to happen, the\nUnited Nations must reform.\nFor some years, from this rostrum, heads of State\nand Government have been urging the need for reform,\nand the Secretary-General has welcomed that initiative.\nI want to join my voice to theirs so that once and for all\nwe actually carry out the reform. We cannot afford to\nwait any longer or the people of the world will lose\nfaith in the United Nations.\nWe do not need an organization with a glorious\npast. We need an organization with a future, one that\ncan tackle the world\u2019s most serious problems. For that\nreason it is necessary that the principal organs be more\nrepresentative.\nThere are political struggles and armed conflicts\non every continent. There is no region of the world\nwhere peace and harmony reign. Some are regional\nconflicts, some are internal ones, but they are no less\nbloody for that. And yet, there is one struggle that is\nglobal in dimension and that requires global solutions.\nI am speaking of the struggle against hunger and\npoverty. That was the subject of a 20 September\nmeeting of more than 60 world leaders, who were\nresolved to tackle it with all the tools available to them.\nI need not dwell on the tragic numbers, but I do\nendorse what has been said by the moving force of that\nmeeting, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil:\n\u201cpeace can never grow out of poverty and hunger\u201d.\nIn Latin America the threat to democracy posed\nby military coups has been significantly reduced. It is\nno longer army divisions that threaten democracy; it is\nthe legions of the poor and the unprotected who can\ndestroy democratic institutions if their basic needs are\nnot met.\nBut then we face a contradiction: the more\npoverty there is in a given country, the less likelihood\nthere is of being able to defeat it. Countries are crushed\nby public debt. Millions of people are being born today\nalready owing more than they will earn in their entire\nlifetime. Often those debts are the result of past\ndeficits, which, owing to excessive bureaucracy, bad\nprojects or corruption, produced no tangible benefits\nfor the people. The fiscal problems facing most of the\ncountries in our region make the situation even worse,\nas Governments lack the resources they need to try to\nmeet the minimum needs of their people.\nThis analysis is not a new one. The \u201clost decade\u201d\nof the 1980s was the result of exactly the same\nproblems, although there was also an international\neconomic crisis and an absence of democratic\n28\n\nlegitimacy in most of the continent at that time. There\nare, however, undeniable differences between that\nperiod and the present. On the one hand, over the past\nfew years unprecedented wealth has been generated,\nwhile at the same time the number of poor has grown.\nOn the other hand, although more countries are\ndemocratic today, there is also a greater amount of\ndebate on how to effectively address society\u2019s\nimmediate problems.\nDemocracy, as a system of government, ended up\nbeing conflated with the limitations of individuals,\nwhile in truth the problem was that Governments were\nunable to produce effective responses. The problem is\nthus not democracy; the problem lies with\nGovernments.\nDirect help to Governments, in the form of loans\nor grants, has not been enough or sufficiently effective\nto solve the problems of poverty or the lack of growth\nthat the aid was supposed to correct. Those of us who\nhave the responsibility of governing and trying to\nprovide answers cannot forget that, for many, patience\nhas yielded to despair. The immediacy of their needs\ndemands immediate solutions, which are not always to\nhand. That means that we have to speak out clearly\nabout the problems, that we have to administer our\nStates with transparency and that we have to fight\ncorruption in order to win back the trust of people who\nare tired of so much deception and frustration.\nLatin America needs a new economic agenda, one\nnot based at just throwing money at social problems. It\nneeds an agenda that seeks to understand the complex\nnature of our countries and institutions. Stopping\npayments, restructuring, adjustments \u2014 that is a road\nthat we have been down before, and our region was the\nloser.\nThe new agenda requires absolute transparency in\npublic administration and accountability. But the task\nof making public administration more efficient and\nmore transparent takes time and resources. But interest\non debt builds up, and the needs of a large sector of the\npopulation also increase.\nProgress in reducing poverty among our peoples\nwill require much effort and great resources from the\npoor countries; to a degree, creditor countries and\nmultilateral agencies could compensate them by\nreducing public debt. In that regard, we propose that a\nrelief clause be included in the lending programmes of\nthe international financial institutions to reduce future\ninterest on our public debt if we meet agreed goals on\npoverty reduction. That would be one way of\ncompensating Governments for their efforts to alleviate\npoverty while also allowing them to meet their\nfinancial obligations.\nIn the past few years, people\u2019s concerns have\nshifted dramatically. Cultural heritage, natural wealth,\nbiodiversity and animal species threatened with\nextinction must all be protected. It seems that\nsometimes financial resources are found more easily\nfor those issues than for the millions of human beings\nwho are dying every day of hunger, or for those who\nare barely surviving, unable to live a decent life, and\nwithout hope.\nI would like to join in the widespread call on the\ninternational community to devise and implement bold\nand generous approaches to tackle poverty. It is\nshameful that in the technological age, when so many\nthings have been invented that were unimaginable just\n10 years ago, that we have not been able to invent a\nway for millions of people in the world to escape from\nthe subhuman conditions to which poverty condemns\nthem.\nSometimes it seems that international aid is\nprovided only if there are desperate tragedies or acts of\nterrorism. Of course, when nations are victims of\nnational disaster or terrorism such international\nassistance is necessary and commendable. I would like\nto take this opportunity to reiterate Panama\u2019s resolve to\ncombat terrorism wherever it may occur. But we must\nnot forget that many more people die because of\npoverty than in wars or natural disasters.\nI am pleased to report that Panama has done its\nduty and has stood by the international community in\nits efficient and safe management of the Canal. We\nshall continue in future to manage that important artery\nof international trade in the same way, so that it will\nbe, as it has been today, open to shipping from all\ncountries of the world.\nI will return to my country optimistic, because I\nhave seen here a determination to fight poverty. I have\nsensed the solidarity of the international community in\nthe face of natural disaster and I have renewed my\nbelief that when there is the will, when there is faith\nand determination, the most difficult tasks can be\naccomplished."

        "file_text": "Nelson Mandela once\ndescribed his country\u00eds transition to democracy as a\nlong journey to freedom comprising many milestones,\neach a realization of new opportunities for him and his\nnation. We, the Afghan people, started our journey to\nstability and democracy almost three years ago. I am\ndelighted to report that, 18 days from today, our people\nwill go to the polls for the first time to elect their\nPresident, marking the most significant milestone in\nour journey.\nAs the presidential elections will mark the end of\nthe transitional period set forth in the historic Bonn\nAgreement, I would like to outline some of\nAfghanistan\u00eds achievements over the past three years\nand discuss our challenges.\nMuch has changed in my country, but no change\nis more visible than the confidence of the Afghan\npeople in the future of our country. We have seen that\nconfidence in the return of more than 3.5 million\nrefugees who are now rebuilding their lives. We have\nseen that confidence in the enthusiasm of families who\nare sending their boys and girls to school, rebuilding\ntheir homes and setting up their businesses. And we\nhave seen that confidence in the enthusiasm of 10.5\nmillion Afghans who have registered to vote in the\nupcoming elections.\nEarlier this year, the Constitutional Loya Jirga\nadopted an enlightened Constitution establishing a\ndemocratic Islamic republic. It guarantees equal rights\nand equal protection for all citizens \u00f3 men and\nwomen. The vision of the Constitutional Loya Jirga is\nbecoming a reality. Approximately 42 per cent of the\nregistered voters are women, and women will make up\nat least 25 per cent of our future parliament. Our\nConstitution also guarantees freedom of speech and\nfreedom of the press.\nDuring the past year, we enacted the election law,\nestablished the necessary mechanism to organize and\nmanage elections and completed voter registration, and\nwe are now preparing to hold presidential and\nparliamentary elections. Thanks to the cooperation of\nour two brotherly neighbours, Pakistan and Iran,\nhundreds of thousands of Afghans still living in those\ncountries will also participate in the election.\n2\n\nIn partnership with the international community,\nwe have intensified our efforts to rebuild our national\nsecurity institutions. Today, there are 15,000 national\narmy soldiers and nearly 30,000 national police\nofficers providing security to our citizens. We are\ngrateful to the thousands of International Security\nAssistance Force and coalition troops that are assisting\nour security forces. We have also taken steps towards\ndisarming, demobilizing and reintegrating private\nmilitias. Nearly all of the heavy weapons have been\ncollected from the city of Kabul, and thousands of\nformer combatants have been disarmed in various parts\nof the country.\nWe have continued the reconstruction of our\ncountry. At the Berlin conference this year, the\ninternational community renewed its commitment to\nrebuilding Afghanistan. The generous pledges that we\nreceived in Berlin will be committed to national\nreconstruction and development programmes that will\ncreate economic opportunities for our citizens and will\nfurther promote economic growth throughout the\nregion. Eradicating poverty and meeting the\neducational and health needs of our citizens will\ncontinue to remain among our top priorities. We will\ncontinue to focus on building our roads to re-establish\nAfghanistan as the land bridge for transcontinental\ntrade. Upon completion of Afghanistan\u00eds ring road,\nevery major Central Asian capital will be less than 32\nhours from the Persian Gulf and the port of Karachi.\nWhile our achievements are significant, we\ncontinue to face challenges. Terrorism remains one of\nour main challenges. The remnants of terrorism\ncontinue to attack our citizens and to threaten our\nsecurity. As long as terrorism continues to exist in our\nregion, neither Afghanistan nor our neighbours nor,\nindeed, the rest of the world can be safe. Eliminating\nthe remnants of terrorism in Afghanistan and in the\nregion requires not only continued support from the\ninternational community, but also strong and sincere\ncommitment from other countries in the region. To stop\nthe movement of terrorists across borders, the countries\nin the region must cooperate closely.\nThe cultivation and trafficking of narcotics is\nanother major challenge to Afghanistan and to the rest\nof the world. Drug profits finance terrorism and\nundermine our efforts to build a healthy and legitimate\neconomy. Afghanistan is fully committed to\neliminating this menace. However, we cannot succeed\nwithout the strong partnership of the international\ncommunity.\nPoverty remains another serious challenge. Even\nthough we have made considerable progress over the\npast three years, we are still one of the poorest\ncountries. We still have the second-highest infant and\nmaternal mortality rates in the world, and we have one\nof the highest illiteracy rates. Very few Afghans have\naccess to safe drinking water, and only 6 per cent of the\nAfghan population has reliable access to electricity.\nOur achievements have not come without a cost.\nDuring the elections for the Constitutional Loya Jirga,\nterrorists did everything to disrupt the process,\nincluding bombing an elementary school and killing\nmore than 20 children. During the registration for the\nelections, terrorists showed their desperation by\nintensifying their attacks. They bombed vehicles\ncarrying women registration workers, killed civilians\nwho carried registration cards and bombed religious\nschools, killing children.\nThose attacks have not stopped our people from\npassing one milestone after another. The valuable role\nof the international community has been crucial to our\nsuccess. Nations from different continents with\ndifferent cultures and religions have come together to\nhelp rebuild Afghanistan. That is a clear example of\ncooperation among civilizations. On behalf of the\nAfghan people, I thank all the nations that have\nsupported us with their troops and resources, especially\nthe United States of America, Japan, Germany, the\nUnited Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Spain, France and\nTurkey. We are most grateful to the United Nations for\nthe commitment and engagement of United Nations\nagencies and employees during the past three years. We\nespecially appreciate the personal commitment and\ndedication of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan;\nhis Deputy Special Representative, Mr. Jean Arnaud;\nand his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\nwhose wisdom and leadership have guided us\nthroughout the journey.\nAfghanistan is on the road to recovery from the\ndevastation of more than two decades of war. Much has\nbeen accomplished in the past three years. Yet\nestablishing a stable, democratic and prosperous\nAfghanistan requires sustained and collaborative\nefforts by the Afghans, by our neighbours and by the\ninternational community. We, the Afghan people, will\ndo our share. Working together for a stable and\n3\n\nprosperous Afghanistan not only is a good example of\nsuccessful international cooperation, but will also\ncontribute to regional prosperity and global security."

        "file_text": "At the\noutset, I would like to say that I feel very honoured and\nprivileged to participate for the first time in the work\nof the General Assembly and to represent the Republic\nof Moldova at this rostrum.\nOn behalf of the Moldovan delegation, I wish to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your well deserved\nelection. I am confident that your vast experience and\ndiplomatic skills will help the Assembly at the current\nsession to fulfil its important tasks.\nI join other speakers in expressing our gratitude\nto your predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for the\ndedicated and effective manner in which he guided the\nwork of the previous session.\nThis has indeed been a difficult year for the\nOrganization, with serious crises occurring in various\nparts of the world. Increasingly, the international\ncommunity is faced with conflicts within States, the\npainful manifestations of which have been seen in\nconflicts in the Middle East, Africa, the North\nCaucasus and elsewhere.\nWe are all preoccupied by the implications and\nconsequences of the crisis in Iraq. The Republic of\nMoldova considers that the United Nations should be\nengaged in a more consistent way in helping that\ncountry to stabilize its internal situation and to embark\non the path towards recovery, development and\ndemocracy.\nEarlier, in Spain and Turkey and, most recently,\nin the Russian Federation, we have seen how\nterrorism \u2014 the scourge of the twenty-first century \u2014\nindiscriminately strikes the innocent, including\nchildren. We strongly believe that terrorist acts must be\nconsidered crimes against humanity. The Republic of\nMoldova strongly condemns all terrorist acts, for\nwhich there can be no excuse or justification. We pay\nhomage to the victims of that violence.\nPrecisely due to the challenges faced, the\nRepublic of Moldova fully supports the ongoing reform\nprocess of the United Nations system. A key aspect of\nthat process is the reform of the Security Council. Too\noften, that principal organ has been accused of failures\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\nIt is therefore essential to make it more efficient in the\ndischarge of its primary responsibility. In our view, the\nefficiency of the Security Council can be achieved by\nimproving its representativeness, legitimacy,\ntransparency and accountability and by restricting the\nright of veto to issues of substance, as provided for by\nthe United Nations Charter.\nThe Republic of Moldova shares the view that the\nreform of the United Nations system will be successful\nonly if the reform of the Security Council is followed\nby the reform of the General Assembly and the\nEconomic and Social Council. We support the\nmomentum created for revitalizing the Assembly and\nstrengthening the coordinating functions of the\nEconomic and Social Council in the social and\neconomic fields. Effective coordination among the\nthree main bodies is essential if we want to address\ncomprehensively the urgent problems of today\u2019s world.\nIn the new circumstances, the United Nations\nshould continue to improve its capacity in the field of\npeacekeeping, which is an important instrument for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\nsupport actions aimed at enhancing the United Nations\nrapid deployment capabilities through its standby\narrangements. I would like to mention that Moldova\nhas committed itself to contribute troops to the United\nNations Standby Arrangements System through\nyesterday\u2019s signing at the Department of Peacekeeping\nOperations of a formal document in that regard. The\nRepublic of Moldova is already present in United\nNations peacekeeping efforts, with military observers\nand staff officers in United Nations missions in Liberia\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. We are determined to continue to\nsupport United Nations activities in this area.\nIt is crucial to further strengthen the United\nNations anti-terrorist legal framework. The Republic of\nMoldova fully supports the current efforts to conclude\na convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear\nterrorism and a comprehensive international\nconvention on international terrorism.\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General\nfor his many initiatives to make the Organization more\neffective. The creation of the High-level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change is another important\nstep in that direction. Like other Member States, the\nRepublic of Moldova looks forward to concrete\nrecommendations from the Panel on how to tackle\n13\n\ncontemporary threats, including new ones such as\nintra-State conflicts, terrorism and separatism.\nWe cannot realistically expect to win the war\nagainst international terrorism as long as regional and\ninternal conflicts remain unsolved and their root causes\nnot properly addressed. Recently, terrorism has\nincreasingly been merging with separatism. Many\nterrorists and international criminals have found a safe\nhaven in the regions affected by internal conflicts and\nsecessionist tendencies.\nIn this context, I would like to add my voice to\nthose who have repeatedly warned in recent years of\nthe danger posed by aggressive separatism. Separatism\nprovides fertile ground for various extremist forces and\nterrorist groups. It has become one of the main sources\nof internal conflicts and regional instability. To ignore\nit would have tragic consequences for numerous\ncountries of a multi-ethnic composition.\nRegretfully, separatism continues to be the main\nobstacle to consolidating the independence and\nstatehood of the Republic of Moldova. Over the years,\nthe Republic of Moldova has systematically informed\nthe relevant international organizations of the danger\nthat the political conflict in its eastern region poses to\nregional and international peace and security. The\nsettlement of the conflict has become the country\u2019s\nabsolute priority. The initiatives put forward by the\nRepublic of Moldova in recent years reflect the\ndetermination and political will of Moldovan\nauthorities to resolve this political conflict peacefully,\non the basis of respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the country. In particular, I would\nlike to underline the initiative of the President of the\nRepublic of Moldova, Mr. Vladimir Voronin, on the\nestablishment of the Joint Constitutional Commission\ncharged with drafting a new constitution.\nDespite the constructive approach by Moldovan\nauthorities in their dialogue with the self-appointed\nTransdniestrian leaders and other participants in the\nmultilateral framework of negotiations, developments\nhave demonstrated the inefficiency of these\nnegotiations. It has also become obvious that the\nseparatist leaders do not sincerely wish for the\ncountry\u2019s reintegration. In this regard, I should\nmention, among other things, the recent closure of\nMoldovan schools that use Latin script, the inhumane\ntreatment of children and ethnic discrimination.\nThis region remains an area rife with the illegal\nmanufacture and traffick of arms. Given the porousness\nof the Transdniestrian section of the Moldovan-\nUkrainian border, there are no guarantees that the\nillegally manufactured or trafficked armaments will not\nreach other conflicts zones in the future.\nWe are also deeply concerned about the human\nrights situation in the area controlled by separatist\nforces. The separatist regime has systematically\nviolated most human rights, including the right of\nassociation, the right to a fair trial, freedom from\ntorture, freedom of movement and, especially, the right\nto education. All of these human rights violations\nhinder the democratization process within the region.\nAt the same time, we have encountered a biased\nattitude on the part of the involved parties, reflected in\nthe support for smuggling and in the obvious violations\nof existing bilateral and international agreements. We\ndeem it necessary to modify the components of the\npeacekeeping mechanism and to replace it with a new\none under an international mandate.\nConsidering that the interests of regional stability\nand security require an objective and impartial\napproach, it is necessary to ensure full respect for\ninternational law and democratic standards. More\nimportantly, any geopolitical and geo-economic\ninterest in maintaining the status-quo needs to be\nabandoned. Strict implementation of the decisions\ntaken at the 1999 Istanbul Summit of the Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe would\nharmoniously fit such an approach.\nAlso, as has already been mentioned during the\ncurrent debate, we must exclude the practice of\napplying double standards when dealing with internal\nconflicts and the means for their settlement.\nThe reintegration of the country and\nconsolidation of democratic values within its entire\nterritory are essential conditions for the European\nintegration of the Republic of Moldova. It is in this\ncontext that the President of the Republic of Moldova\nhas launched an initiative on a stability and security\npact for Moldova. This document is aimed at ensuring\nconsensus among the parties concerned, in order to\nguarantee the development of an independent,\nsovereign and integral Moldovan State. We believe that\nholding an international conference on this issue\nshould be the next step in initiating the debate on the\nmeasures to follow. This situation demonstrates the\ninternational character of the problem, as well as the\ninefficiency of existing regional settlement\nmechanisms.\n14\n\nToday, the main challenges for the United\nNations in the economic, social and related fields stem\nfrom world trends, such as globalization and increasing\necological interdependence, and from persistent factors\nsuch as widespread poverty and severe social\ninequalities between and within States. They should be\naddressed by a strengthened global partnership\nbetween industrialized countries, developing countries,\ncountries with transitional economies and\nintergovernmental institutions.\nThe Millennium Development Goals remain the\nmost significant objectives agreed to by the\ninternational community, as they cover the areas of\nmajor concern for the peoples of the world. It is\ntherefore of utmost importance to achieve the Goals, as\nwell as other specific developmental targets set\nsubsequently by several major United Nations\nconferences in the economic and social fields. In this\ncontext, we welcome the decision of the General\nAssembly, adopted at its last session, to hold in\nSeptember 2005 a high-level meeting that will\nundertake a comprehensive review of the progress\nmade in the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration, including the Millennium Development\nGoals, as well as a review of the integrated and\ncoordinated implementation of the outcomes of the\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits.\nThis review is necessary, given the overall slow\npace of implementation. We share the concerns\nexpressed in this respect by many States, in particular\nby the countries sponsoring the world leaders\u2019 New\nYork Declaration on the Action against Hunger and\nPoverty, which was adopted on 20 September. Like\nthem, we believe that if resolute and urgent action is\nnot taken, the Millennium Development Goals will not\nbe reached by 2015 in some regions of the world.\nWe should not forget, in this context, about the\ngrave social and economic problems that affect crisis-\nstricken countries and countries with special needs, in\nparticular landlocked countries. Creating an enabling\nenvironment for sustainable development is a challenge\nfor them and, therefore, they should be further assisted\nby the United Nations system and the donor\ncommunity.\nI would like to reiterate, in conclusion, my\ncountry\u2019s commitment to the Organization and its\nwillingness to cooperate with other Member States in\norder to achieve the noble goals and principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me at the outset, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Comoros and on my own behalf, to\ncongratulate you warmly on your election to preside\nover the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session. Your task is by no means an easy one,\nbut it is an honour to you personally, to your country\nand to the entire African continent. No other\norganization can boast of that universal mission. I\nwould therefore like to assure you of the full readiness\nof my delegation to work with you for the success of\nthat noble mission in the service of peace and security\nin the world.\nMy delegation welcomes the way in which your\npredecessor guided the work at the fifty-eighth session.\nOn behalf of the Comoros I hail the tireless\ncommitment and complete availability of the\nSecretary-General in the fight he leads to advance the\nideals of peace, social justice, development and\nfreedom throughout the world.\nThe world \u2014 a world of peace and vision,\nOf ideas and union now unfurled,\nA world that has divided lands\nAnd with seas that share their sands;\nWorld of tolerance and knowing,\nWorld abundance, overflowing;\nWorld of peace, world that charmed,\nNo, world; you cannot be harmed.\nNations unity provided,\nBut hearts tend to be divided.\nFor we have met each other,\nAnd yet our peoples live in fear.\nChildren of the world,\nand countries of the world,\n24\n\nWhere is the world?\nWhat is this world?\nBorders here do not exist;\nPrayers vanish in the mist.\nTerror is their daily lot;\nFear is all that they have got.\nKillers rule instead of bread.\nMillennium world, world so fair,\nYet a world of billionaires;\nWorld of speeches of all sorts\nWithin fora, and of courts.\nWorld rejecting our solutions\nand denying resolutions.\nWhat a world. What a peace.\nWhile the world is slowly forging ahead in this\nthird millennium, we are obliged to note that the\nfeelings of our respective peoples are fluctuating\nbetween hope and concern. Indeed, while the\nrelationship between peace and development is\nbecoming increasingly justified and is making them\nindivisible, the path of world events is tending to call\nthis into question. It is indeed true that there can be no\npeace and no security in the world as long as hundreds\nof millions of individuals are still prisoners of\ndestitution and poverty and still do not have the\nminimum necessary for a decent daily life. Nor can\nthere be peace and security in the world as long as,\nworking all together, we have not made the required\nefforts to save the hundreds of millions of human lives\nthreatened by the scourges of AIDS and other\npandemics.\nMoreover, what kind of peace can there be in a\nworld that makes the spread of weapons and the\nproliferation of hotbeds of tension the very pattern of\nits existence and the means for its evolution?\nThese are the problems before us, this forum with\nthe highest priority mission of seeing to the proper\nconduct of world affairs, the prosperity and flourishing\nof the human race and to the control of the global\nenvironment by our actions, which must serve the\ncause and the welfare of each and every people, each\nnation and each citizen of the world.\nThat is why it is incumbent on the United\nNations, today more than ever, to play fully its role as\ndefined by the Charter. This role is one of vanguard\naction, of mediation par excellence, of stimulus and of\npromotion of the remarkable accomplishments wrought\nevery day by the progress of science.\nFor that reason, my country says \u201cno\u201d to poverty,\n\u201cno\u201d to AIDS and other pandemics, \u201cno\u201d to terrorism\nand \u201cyes\u201d to the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. In order to combat the scourges of\npoverty, major diseases and terrorism, we need a firm\nand determined will to work for development.\nThe Millennium Summit, in which all the\nforemost leaders of our planet participated, took full\nnote of that reality. The Millennium Declaration set out\nthe steps and the course to follow in order to\neffectively direct the world\u2019s development and\nprogressively correct the problems identified. The\nDeclaration established 2015 as the deadline for\nreviewing the plan of action that each country must\nimplement, in a collective resolve to get the world back\non track.\nThe Union of the Comoros endorses the\nMillennium Development Goals. While working for\nprogress in the national reconciliation process, the\nGovernment of my country, like all other members of\nthe community of nations, has made the necessary\nefforts to establish a poverty reduction strategy. Today,\nthat document to which all active forces in our country\ncontributed, constitutes the instrument panel of our\ndevelopment priorities.\nIn order for the Comoros to act on those\ndevelopment priorities, it requires the assistance of the\ninternational community. It was only this past April\nthat my country finally completed the establishment of\nits institutions, thus bringing to a close the separatist\nand institutional crisis that for seven years had shaken\nthe foundations of our State.\nIn particular, we hope that the entire international\ncommunity will support the African Union\u2019s call,\nissued at the recent summit at Addis Ababa, for an\ninternational donors round-table meeting to be held to\nassist the convalescent Comoros. This would enable it\nto recover and by stages to rejoin the other nations in\nworking at the subregional, continental and global\nlevels to achieve sustainable development, which is\nnow its greatest priority.\nThe firm national commitment of all Member\nStates of the international community is required to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. This\n25\n\nmilitates in favour of the enhanced representation of\ncontinents and peoples in the United Nations.\nWe should therefore consider increasing the\npermanent membership of the Security Council to\ninclude, for example, the Republic of India, Japan, the\nFederal Republic of Germany and the Federative\nRepublic of Brazil. The African continent and the Arab\nworld also deserve appropriate representation on the\nSecurity Council. That is the way to achieve equity,\nand equity is desperately needed for there to be greater\njustice and peace in the world. That appears to be what\nmust be done today to create the necessary balance for\ncontrol of the international order and the global\nenvironment, which have never been so unstable and\nuncertain.\nIn the eternal search for peace, social justice and\nprosperity, the fate of small island States, which face\nso many threats to their survival, must not remain in\njeopardy. Let us be fully aware that numerous countries\nare destined to disappear because of such hazards as\nrising sea-levels, desertification, cyclones and volcanic\neruptions. Accordingly, we must consider specific\nactions for each of those States. We urge the\ninternational community to mobilize on a large scale to\nensure the success of the forthcoming meting of small\nisland developing States, to be convened on the island\nof Mauritius early in 2005.\nI must not fail to affirm before the Assembly that\nmy country, the Union of the Comoros, in its concern\nto maintain its unity and integrity, considers the issue\nof the Comorian island of Mayotte to be one of its\ngreatest and most urgent priorities. My Government is\nconvinced that a speedy settlement of this dispute will\nfurther the development of the country as a whole and\nwill enable it to resolutely take its place alongside\npeace- and freedom-loving countries and to champion\nuniversal ideals and promote democracy in the world.\nThe Union of the Comoros therefore calls on the\nFrench Republic to engage in a constructive political\ndialogue on this issue, in compliance with General\nAssembly resolution 3385 (XXX), which admitted the\nComoros to the United Nations as the Comoro\nArchipelago, composed of four islands: Mayotte,\nAnjouan, Moh\u00e9li and Grande-Comore.\nIn the same spirit, my country attaches the utmost\nimportance to the principle of a single independent and\nindivisible China and calls for the restoration of the\nisland of Taiwan to its rightful home.\nMy country truly values the very constructive\ndialogue now under way between the Government of\nthe Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan on the question of Kashmir.\nThe Union of the Comoros sincerely hopes that\nthe Palestinian and Israeli peoples will soon institute a\ndialogue that will bring about an end to the violence\nand lead to the peaceful coexistence of those two\nneighbouring peoples.\nIt also hopes to see a just and equitable settlement\nto the question of Western Sahara and vigorously\nsupports the efforts made to that end by the United\nNations and the Government of the Kingdom of\nMorocco.\nThe Union of the Comoros vehemently condemns\nthe hostage-takings in Iraq and hopes to see a rapid\nreturn of peace and security in Iraq, which will\ncontribute to security in the region.\nThe Union of the Comoros is closely following\ndevelopments in Darfur. It supports the efforts of the\nAfrican Union, the Government of the Sudan and the\nentire international community to find a speedy, just\nand equitable settlement of that question.\nFinally, I hope that the work of the fifty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly will be successful,\nand I join all those eminent personalities who have\npreceded me at this noble rostrum in expressing my\ncountry\u2019s most fervent desires for greater peace and\nsecurity throughout the world."

        "file_text": "It is a special honour for me, as a member of the new\nGovernment of Luxembourg and its Minister for\nForeign Affairs and Immigration, to take the floor for\nthe first time before this gathering of the nations of the\nworld.\nYou, sir, have acceded to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at a time when decisions fraught\nwith consequences for the future of our Organization\nmust be prepared and discussed. Our Secretary-General\nhas reminded us that the United Nations is at a\ncrossroads. I have no doubt that, under your skilled and\nwise leadership, our General Assembly will be able\neffectively and decisively to provide constructive and\nconsensual responses to the great issues of our time.\nThe session ahead, leading us to the\ncommemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the\nestablishment of the United Nations, must be one of\nrenewal for multilateralism. I can assure you, Sir, that\nmy country \u2014 a founding Member of the United\nNations \u2014 intends to contribute actively to that crucial\nwork, in particular within the presidency of the Council\nof the European Union, to which Luxembourg will\naccede on 1 January 2005, following the current\npresidency of the Netherlands. It goes without saying\nthat I fully subscribe to the statement made by my\ncolleague, Mr. Bernard Bot, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of the Netherlands, before this Assembly.\nFrom this moment until the sixtieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, three themes will be the focus of\nour attention: issues linked to the maintenance of peace\nand security; the complex question of development and\nits financing; and United Nations reform.\nWe must begin this genuine relaunching of\nmultilateral cooperation first of all in the area of the\nmaintenance of peace and security, basing our action\non the United Nations Charter. While regional crises\nand civil wars have multiplied in various areas of the\nglobe, in particular on the African continent over the\npast year, history has taught us, often tragically and\npainfully, that peace and stability can only be\nmaintained and guaranteed within the framework of an\ninternational order based on the rule of law and shared\nstrong and effective institutions based on fundamental\nshared values. This has been stated in our superb\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the\nsubsequent normative instruments that supplemented it.\nThis is also the lesson learned from the fratricidal\nhorrors and conflicts of the past century between\nmember States of the European Union, which now we\nare gratified to see expanded to 25 members.\nIn that context, we look with concern toward the\nMiddle and Near East, where situations of tension and\nof open conflict seem to be worsening. Regarding the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, we must emphatically\nrecall here, given a situation characterized by\nnumerous impasses on all sides, that the path of\nnegotiation and compromise remains the only\nreasonable path and that the road map remains the only\nway to achieve a negotiated solution between the\nparties, based on the coexistence of two States, namely,\nan independent and viable Palestinian State, living in\npeace next to Israel, within secure and recognized\nborders. This was also vigorously reaffirmed by the\nQuartet the day before yesterday. In the same way, any\nwithdrawal by Israel from the Gaza Strip must take\nplace within the context of the political process\ndescribed by the road map.\nThe unanimous adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) on the situation in Iraq and the\nsubsequent restoration of Iraqi sovereignty constitute\nan important stage in the process of political, social\nand economic reconstruction of this battered country.\nThe European Union, for its part, adopted in early\nSeptember a set of measures designed to further\nstrengthen the European commitment to Iraq. We hope\nthat conditions will soon be such that the United\nNations will be able to fully play its proper role, in\nparticular regarding the political process, the\npreparation for elections, humanitarian assistance and\nreconstruction.\nLuxembourg has also been following with the\ngreatest attention developments in the situation in the\nGreat Lakes region, the Western Balkans, and, in\nparticular, in Kosovo, as well as in Darfur in Sudan.\nMy country fully associates itself with the positions\npresented here by my Dutch colleague on behalf of the\nEuropean Union.\n15\n\nThe preservation of peace, crisis prevention and\nmanagement and peacekeeping are among the noblest\ntasks of our Organization. The Security Council has an\nimportant role to play here. We should not hesitate to\nconsider innovative solutions in defining new\napproaches and institutional processes to strengthen\nour collective capacity for prevention and action on the\nbasis of the Charter.\nHere I would like to welcome the measures taken\nby the Secretary-General regarding the prevention of\ngenocide. I would venture to hope that the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change will be able\nto put before us proposals to both improve our capacity\nfor shared action and cope with the new threats to\npeace and security, among which, first and foremost,\nare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. United Nations instruments in fighting\nterrorism were recently enhanced by the adoption of\nSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and the\nimplementation measures which flow from it.\nHowever, the recent report of the Analytical Support\nand Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution\n1267 (1999) concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and\nAssociated Individuals and Entities reminded us that a\ngreat deal still remains to be done to put an end to\nthese despicable and unacceptable practices which\nleave so many families throughout the world in\nmourning.\nThe fight against terrorism cannot be won solely\nthrough the use of military and police means. We must\nstrike at its roots, which spawn hate, brutality and the\nsenseless destruction of human lives. The core of any\nmultilateral system is the right of all peoples and every\nhuman being to live in peace and dignity.\nThe threat of weapons of mass destruction also\nremains a concern of highest priority. While significant\nprogress has been made, disturbing news has reached\nus over the last few months from other regions of the\nglobe, in particular from Iran and from the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea. In each of these cases, the\nnecessary clarifications and full guarantees must be\nprovided, particularly within the framework of strict\nrespect for the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) regimes. Here, I would like to emphasize that\nthe 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons must provide an\nopportunity for reaffirming the validity and relevance\nof the shared quest for solutions to the complex issues\nof non-proliferation.\nRegarding all of these cases linked to the\nmaintenance of peace and international security, the\nUnited Nations will find a reliable and committed\npartner in the European Union, which has made the\nemergence of effective multilateralism one of its\npriorities for the security strategy it adopted in\nDecember 2003. It is, indeed, with pride that I add that\nLuxembourg has also been shouldering its\npeacekeeping responsibilities by contributing military\ncontingents to the Kosovo Force and to the\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan,\nwhich are now under the command of the European\nCorps.\nThe issue of development is and must remain the\nfocus of the international community\u2019s attention. This\nis the most important point in this context. While\nmillions of human beings continue to live in\nunacceptable conditions, our rallying around the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\nmust be constant and indeed stepped up, given the fact\nthat many States, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,\nstill experience extreme difficulty in making progress\nto meet the 2015 deadline.\nFor its part, Luxembourg is ready to shoulder its\nduties in the indispensable joint international efforts. In\n2003, our official development assistance (ODA) in\nLuxembourg reached 0.81 per cent of our gross\nnational product and the goal of having this figure\nreach one per cent in the years to come is part of the\nprogramme of the new Government that was formed in\nJuly of this year. The struggle against poverty and the\ncommitment to sustainable development on the global\nlevel are also major objectives of the policy of\ncooperation in Luxembourg, the policy that we are\nimplementing together with our partners in a spirit of\npartnership and participation. In our actions to ensure\ncooperation, particular emphasis must be placed on the\ncontinuation of international efforts targeting\nreproductive health, in particular, combating the\nhorrendous scourge of HIV/AIDS.\nIn addition to an increase in ODA on the global\nscale, other sources of financing can be used, and the\ninitiative of Presidents Lula and Chirac has charted the\nway for a number of interesting ideas in this respect.\nWe believe that it is critical to maintain the Monterrey\nConsensus as a whole. Any effective development\n16\n\nstrategy in the medium- and long-term must be based\non a proper combination of elements such as ODA,\ninternational trade, direct foreign investment and the\ndomestic efforts of the countries involved, particularly\nregarding capacity reinforcement, strengthening of\ngovernance and the rule of law. In this regard, I am\nconvinced that all efforts must be further developed to\nachieve a positive conclusion to the Doha development\nround.\nAs Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration,\nI must mention an innovation in our national political\ncontext, as did our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\non 29 January 2004, in an inciteful speech to the\nEuropean Parliament in Brussels regarding the growing\nimportance of the problem of migration, particularly\nfor Europe. This issue must be addressed through a\ncareful management of migration flows by focusing on\nintegration and international cooperation. Decisive\naction against organized crime, in particular crime\nlinked to any kind of trafficking in human beings, is an\nindispensable corollary to this.\nWe are called upon to step up our efforts during\nthe year to come to prepare for a significant event,\nnamely, the September 2005 summit, and which, in\nUnited Nations jargon, is being called the \u201cmajor\nevent\u201d. Five years after the Millennium Summit, this\nmeeting of the highest political leaders on the planet\nshould provide an opportunity to define a new\nsynthesis \u2014 a new global agenda \u2014 at the dawn of the\ntwenty-first century.\nIndeed, we face many significant challenges.\nTogether, we must review all of the commitments\nundertaken in the Millennium Declaration and at the\nmajor conferences of the 1990s, assess their\nimplementation and, within the Organization, make\nany adjustments and adaptations that a changing global\ncontext requires \u2014 all without compromising the level\nof the shared ambitions that inspire us. We must see to\nit that the new global agenda expresses the hopes and\naspirations of the entire international community. In\nparticular, development must continue to be a focus of\nthe attention it deserves. There is also a need to open\nour Organization up to the new debates and the new\nissues that are emerging in the area of the maintenance\nof peace and security.\nNone of the foregoing issues are fiefdoms of a\nparticular State or group of States. Rather, they are\nconcerns shared by all Member States and, as such,\nmust be managed jointly within the multilateral\ninstitutions that form our common heritage. The\nvitality and relevance of our Organization is the key to\nthe effort to redefine the terms of the international\nagenda by giving priority to the concepts of\ninterdependence and solidarity. While the goals are\nvital, the risks are significant, and, together, we must\nchart a coordinated, inclusive and balanced path that\nwill allow each and every one of us to participate fully\nand to express our aspirations and expectations.\nTo achieve those lofty goals we need, first of all,\nto promote the development of a new mindset in our\ndeliberations. After the divisions and controversies of\nrecent years, the international community must once\nagain come together and close ranks around shared,\njoint objectives. In that way the United Nations will\nremain the pre-eminent seat of international legitimacy\nand a vital centre for multilateral action, as the\nSecretary-General recently said. It is that new mindset\nthat must inspire our shared activities as we move\ntowards next year\u2019s major event.\nWe also need to agree on a procedure that will\nensure the participation of all, guarantee the necessary\nbalance among the various aspects of the process and\nguide us towards greater coordination on the substance\nof the political messages to be formulated. In all\nevents, rest assured that my country and its partners in\nthe European Union are ready to participate fully in\nthat debate.\nIn the context of a renewal of multilateralism, as I\nhave tried to outline it here, reform of the United\nNations has pride of place. Our institutions must be\nbetter adapted to meet new challenges, as well as to\nfulfil their present mandates. The genuine renewal of\nthe United Nations system must be reflected in a\npalpable strengthening of the tools for analysis,\ndecision and action available to us. Effective\nmultilateralism must be expressed through the\nstrengthening of the United Nations system as a whole.\nBy adopting a more global approach, we see\nreform not as a zero-sum game, but as a positive-sum\ngame, in which each player and each institution\nbenefits from the new impetus thus provided.\nSignificant progress was already made in the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly during the fifty-\neighth session, under the leadership of the former\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte. Those efforts now remain\n17\n\nto be translated into action as well as continued and\nintensified.\nSecurity Council reform, which has been in\ndiscussion for more than a decade, must be carried out,\nso that that vital body can better reflect the realities of\ntoday\u2019s world; indeed, it is both a prerequisite for the\nCouncil\u2019s legitimacy and a guarantee for the\neffectiveness of its action. More active interaction\nbetween the Security Council and the General\nAssembly and a better coordination of their roles, as\nwell as enhanced transparency regarding States not\nmembers of the Security Council, should form the\nframework of any future enlargement of the Council.\nThe restructuring of the work of the Economic\nand Social Council and the Main Committees of the\nGeneral Assembly should be conducted with\ndetermination and courage so that more focused and\nbetter organized activities can gain greater relevance\nand have greater political impact on the substantive\nproblems being addressed.\nThe strengthening of the rule of law on a global\nscale, as called for by the Secretary-General, and, in\nparticular, the consolidation and ultimate\nuniversalization of the International Criminal Court,\nshould be among our highest priorities, along with the\nprotection of human rights \u2014 the vital importance of\nwhich I would like to emphasize once again.\nFinally, I would be remiss were I to fail to\nmention the Secretariat staff and other United Nations\npersonnel, who are carrying out an extraordinarily\ndifficult mission with courage and dedication, and\nindeed sometimes, as we know, risking their very lives.\nIt is crucial that we be able, within the framework of\nthis year\u2019s budgetary discussions for the year, to\nprovide the Organization with the resources,\nparticularly the financial resources to fulfil the\nmandates that we have conferred upon it, especially in\nregard to peacekeeping operations. It is also vital that\nthe Organization adopt a rigorous policy regarding the\nprotection of United Nations personnel, who are acting\non our behalf in often dangerous conditions in all\ncorners of the globe.\nIt seems that to put a curse on someone, one has\nonly to wish for them to live in interesting times. I do\nnot know if we are living under a curse, but I do know\nthat we are living in an interesting time: a time of\ndebate, a time of restructuring, a time of choice and of\nthe relaunching of international cooperation. Let us\nseize this opportunity and breathe new life into the\nUnited Nations, which has been proven itself to be\nindispensable. But let us also admit that the choice of\nmultilateralism is a demanding one, and one that\nrequires of us all an increased readiness to call into\nquestion our old certainties and to accept new\napproaches within a renewed institutional framework.\nOn the path towards that renewal, let us draw\ninspiration from the magnificent lines of the Spanish\npoet, Antonio Machado, and I quote:\n\u201cTraveller, your footsteps\nAre the road, and nothing else;\nTraveller, there is no road.\nThe road is made by walking;\nWalking makes the road\u201d.\nI am confident that together we will have the\nvision and the courage to take that first step, and the\nsteps that follow, on that ambitious path."

        "file_text": "I am deeply honoured to\nhave this opportunity to address the General Assembly\non behalf of the people of Zambia.\nI would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Ping\non his assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. As one of the 21\nVice-Presidents for the current session, Zambia pledges\nhim its support and cooperation. I would also like to\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte\nof Saint Lucia, for the efficient manner with which he\npresided over the proceedings of the fifty-eighth\nsession. I wish to extend our sincere appreciation to\nSecretary-General Annan for his relentless dedication\nto the cause of international peace, security and\neconomic development.\nThis session of the General Assembly convenes\nat a time when vexing problems plague the world\ncommunity. Zambia believes that the key to addressing\na host of such difficult global issues as terrorism,\nHIV/AIDS and the humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is to\nfind multilateral solutions, often within the context of\nan effective United Nations. Indeed, that is what I\nwould call a multilateral imperative. With that in mind,\nZambia welcomes the report of the Secretary-General\non the work of the Organization.\nIt is also Zambia\u00eds hope that this session will\nbuild on past achievements to advance the global\nagenda. Accordingly, Zambia supports the convening\nof the high-level plenary meeting next year in New\nYork on the Millennium Development Goals, to which\n20\n\nwe committed ourselves in 2000. We firmly believe\nthat all Member States have a collective responsibility\nto implement the commitments set forth in the\nDeclaration.\nMy delegation supports the ongoing reforms of\nthe United Nations. Zambia shares the concerns of\nother countries that this important process has not yet\nbeen completed. Zambia believes that the reforms\nshould address the concerns of developing countries. In\nthat regard, we look forward to the progress reports on\nthe reforms. Zambia appreciates the recent initiatives\nof the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\neighth session on the revitalization, reform and\nenhancement of the working methods of the General\nAssembly. My delegation stands ready to continue\nactively participating in the reform process during this\nsession. We commend the President and his\npredecessor for the revitalization of the General\nAssembly as the highest deliberative and decision-\nmaking organ of the United Nations.\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council,\nZambia remains concerned about the lack of progress. I\ntherefore appeal to this Assembly to support the efforts\nof the Security Council to enhance its decision-making\nand liaison methods during this session.\nAs I stated at the outset, Zambia believes in\nmultilateralism, which continues to be an indispensable\ninstrument for achieving global consensus on\nimportant, life-saving issues. As a global community,\nwe face challenges that are transnational and\ninterconnected in nature. It is essential that we take\nadvantage of the immense problem-solving potential of\nmultilateralism. Unilateralism should have no place in\nthis global era. Zambia reaffirms its support for the\nUnited Nations initiatives in the fight against global\nterrorism and the proliferation of small arms and any\nform of weapon of mass destruction. We call upon the\ninternational community to take all necessary steps\nwithin the purview of the United Nations to combat the\nscourge of terrorism in all its manifestations. That\nscourge needs to be fought relentlessly, with total\ncommitment and vigour. Zambia also pledges to\ncontinue supporting the Counter-Terrorism Committee\nof the Security Council.\nMy delegation would like the United Nations and\nthe world community at large to assist Member States\nin building their capacity to fight international\nterrorism. And we want to express our heartfelt\nsympathy for the innocent victims of terrorism in\nRussia, here in New York and elsewhere.\nZambia expresses its profound dismay at the\ncontinued unrest in the Middle East and the impasse in\nthe Palestinian-Israeli peace process. We call on the\nparties to that longstanding conflict to allow for full\nimplementation of the Quartet\u00eds road map. Zambia\nreiterates that the road map offers a viable solution to\nthe Middle East question. We endorse and support the\ninitiatives for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East\ncrisis. In the same vein, Zambia welcomes the adoption\nof Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004) on Iraq.\nWe fully realize that economic, social and\npolitical development is the primary responsibility of\neach individual country. We are pleased that the Group\nof Eight countries continue to support the New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development (NEPAD), the\nprimary objective of which is eradicating the\nincreasing poverty on our continent and putting\nAfrican countries on the path of sustainable economic\ngrowth. We recognize that the new initiative is by\nAfricans and for Africans, but we cannot ignore the\nvital importance of assistance from the international\ncommunity through increased official development\nassistance.\nExternal debt has continued to consume a large\nproportion of the national incomes of developing\ncountries, especially the least developed countries\n(LDCs). The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\nDebt Initiative was established to assist highly\nindebted poor countries to reduce external debt to\nsustainable levels. Admittedly, the HIPC Initiative does\nhelp reduce the effects of indebtedness. However, it\nhas some inherent problems which inhibit the full\nrealization of its benefits. The international community\nmust, therefore, continue exploring innovative\napproaches toward debt elimination. In that\nconnection, we applaud the efforts of President Lula of\nBrazil in his search for the appropriate financing\nparadigm for the eradication of poverty and hunger.\nAs we endeavour to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, we are very concerned with the\nplight of the LDCs, which constitute 70 per cent of the\nworld\u00eds population. These countries are likely to miss\nthe target we set of reducing by half the number of\npeople living in extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.\n21\n\nLet me briefly change direction and say a few\nwords about certain positive developments in my\ncountry, a place where freedom truly is on the march.\nAs you know the Programme of Action for the\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010\nwas adopted in Brussels in 2001. Since then, Zambia\nhas committed herself to serious economic reform,\nincluding privatization, trade liberalization, the\nadoption of poverty reduction strategies and the\ncreation of an environment conducive to both local and\nforeign investment. While we are doing our part, we\nexpect corresponding action from the international\ncommunity, as agreed upon in the Programme of\nAction. Without assistance, all of our efforts will be\nrendered futile. Our aim is to graduate one day soon\nfrom an LDC to a developing country.\nIn addition, I am proud to say that my\nadministration is based on the rule of law. For example,\nwe have embarked on an ambitious review of our\nconstitution in order to provide ourselves with a\ndocument that will stand the test of time. We call on\nour cooperating partners and well-wishers to support us\nin this important endeavour.\nThis year and next - 2004 and 2005 - are\nimportant years in the lives of our people. I call your\nattention to four important events that are taking place\nin our country during this period.\nFirst, on 24 October 2004, we shall celebrate the\nfortieth anniversary of our national independence.\nThen, in February 2005, Zambia will be hosting the\nThird African Conference on Peace Through Tourism,\nthe high point of which will be a ceremony honouring\nthe hundredth anniversary of the birth of former United\nNations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjild, who\ndied tragically in a plane crash in Ndola, Zambia.\nAlso next year, my country will celebrate the\nhundredth anniversary of the founding of the town of\nLivingstone, the tourist capital of Zambia and home of\nVictoria Falls, also popularly known as the adventure\ncentre of Africa.\nIn addition, next year we will commemorate the\none hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Dr. David\nLivingstone\u00eds first glimpse of Victoria Falls, the\nworld\u00eds largest curtain of falling water, which we call\nMosi-O-Tunya, or the smoke that thunders.\nIt is my honour to invite your Excellencies, and\nthrough you all, all your citizens to come to Zambia\nand participate in these events.\nZambia also welcomes peace initiatives at\nregional, continental and global levels aimed at ending\nconflicts and wars in various parts of the world. It is\nfor this reason that Zambia has continued its active\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions.\nWith peace prevailing in Angola, that country is\nnow faced with the challenge of post-conflict\nreconstruction. Zambia calls on the international\ncommunity to double its assistance to Angola to help\ntackle the humanitarian situations such as the removal\nof landmines and the settlement and reintegration of\nformer combatants and refugees. I am pleased to report\nthat on 15 June 2004, Zambia and Angola witnessed\nthe repatriation of some 363 Angolan refugees in\nnorth-western Zambia, under the auspices of the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees\u00ed voluntary repatriation programme. This was\na good start to the programme, but more international\nsupport is needed.\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate the imperative\nof finding multilateral solutions to the problems that\nconfront us. In our interdependent world, all of the\nproblems and challenges that we face can only be\naddressed through the concerted multilateral efforts of\nthe international community."

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset to express my sincere\ngratitude for the honour to speak from this rostrum and\nto convey, on behalf of the President of Turkmenistan,\nMr. Saparmurat Niyazov, best wishes for peace and\nprosperity to the peoples of all nations. I should also\nlike to congratulate the President of the General\nAssembly on his election to that lofty and responsible\npost and to wish him every success in fruitfully guiding\nthe work of the fifty-ninth session.\nThe events taking place in the world today, which\nare influencing the development of every region and\nevery country, attest to the dramatic changes that have\noccurred in the meaning of the historical process under\nnew conditions. Our ability to elaborate and implement\nqualitatively new approaches to interaction within the\ncommunity of nations will largely determine the degree\nto which security and stability are maintained\nthroughout the world. In that context, an immutable\nprinciple and basic direction for Turkmenistan\u2019s\nforeign policy remains the strengthening and\ndevelopment of close cooperation with the United\n5\n\nNations. I should like to take this opportunity to thank\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nconstant support for the peace-loving foreign policy of\nTurkmenistan.\nWe should note that among the priority areas of\nour country\u2019s cooperation with the United Nations are\nmaintaining international peace and security and\npreventing or resolving conflicts through political\nmeans and processes. With regard to those issues,\nTurkmenistan has often become a centre where, under\nthe aegis of the United Nations and with the\nparticipation of its Special Representatives, effective\nnegotiations have been carried out to resolve complex\nsituations that have taken place in the countries of our\nregion.\nDuring the present general debate, it has been\nnoted several times that one of today\u2019s major threats to\ninternational security and stability is terrorism.\nFollowing the events of 11 September 2001,\nTurkmenistan was one of the first countries to support\nthe United Nations initiative of establishing an\ninternational coalition to fight terrorism, in which we\nhave taken an active part.\nIn that context, Turkmenistan not only firmly\ncondemns any act of terrorism in any part of the world,\nbut also is undertaking specific legislative and practical\nmeasures aimed at fighting that evil and preventing it\nfrom spreading. That is particularly relevant, given that\nthe security conditions of the world community are\ndetermined by each country\u2019s actual contribution to the\nstrengthening of its own internal stability, together with\ncooperation at the collective level. This is why we\nbelieve that there is a need today to draw up a\nqualitatively new dimension, both between individual\nStates and within the framework of their joint activity\nin international organizations.\nDespite the fact that terrorism is multifaceted, its\nnature is one and the same, and at its roots lie a\ndoctrinaire egoism which has been raised by its\nfollowers to the highest level of evil, intolerance and\ncruelty. Terrorism recognizes no State and no\nnationality; it is not affiliated with any religion or\nculture. This is why the war on terrorism and terrorists\nmust be conducted through joint efforts.\nIt is precisely through the close coordination of\nactions of members of the international community, on\nthe basis of norms of international law, that the\nestablishment of a situation in the world can be\nconducted in such a way that any manifestation of\nterrorism will be punished and, as a result, it will be\npossible to take effective measures to combat it. Here,\nTurkmenistan favours effective implementation of a\nbroad-ranging system of measures to combat terrorism,\nincluding active cooperation in finding and bringing to\njustice the organizers and perpetrators of terrorist acts.\nTo counteract international terrorism, and to\nprotect the rights and freedoms of our citizens, we\nmust be able to forestall each of its manifestations and\ncounter it, not only through universal unanimous\ncondemnation, but also through a high degree of\nprofessionalism of law enforcement agencies, and also\nthrough the active use of the entire international legal\narray of instruments drawn up within the framework of\nthe United Nations.\nFurther involvement of the role of the United\nNations is becoming clearer against the backdrop of\nthe present development of both global and regional\nprocesses that require the concentration of collective\nefforts and the adoption of decisions, taking into\naccount a multitude of interests. Here, the fundamental\nprinciples of international cooperation enshrined in the\nCharter and the criteria tested by time concerning\nmaintaining the balance of interests are a high priority\nfor us. By following such a policy, Turkmenistan\nalways attempts fully to utilize the potential of the\ncommunity of nations and institutions in proposing and\nimplementing foreign policy initiatives.\nWe see vast potential in the close partnership\nwith the United Nations and its specialized structures\nin implementing joint programmes and projects. In this\ncontext, we would like to express our gratitude for\ncooperation extended to us by such United Nations\nspecialized agencies as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, UNICEF, the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the\nUnited Nations Population Fund. Through interaction\nwith these agencies, the Government of Turkmenistan\nis implementing a number of major projects that are\nyielding specific results in the social sphere, health\ncare, education, the environment, combating illicit drug\ntrafficking and a number of other areas. Turkmenistan\nwill continue to maintain close ties with these United\nNations agencies in the quest for and implementation\nof new possibilities for cooperation.\n6\n\nA clear example of the strategic partnership of\nTurkmenistan with the United Nations was the signing\nof our country\u2019s Government in February of 2004 of\nthe United Nations Development Assistance\nFramework to promote development for 2005-2009. A\nsignificant feature of this document is the fact that it\nfully coincides with the national priorities and interests\nof Turkmenistan, as defined by the National\nDevelopment Strategy of our country for the period\nuntil 2020. It aims at resolving global objectives within\nthe framework of the United Nations Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nOne of the important components of\nTurkmenistan\u2019s policy is the human dimension. Our\ncountry is conducting joint work with international\norganizations in this area. During the years of\nindependence, we have worked to create genuine\nguarantees for the implementation of personal,\npolitical, economic, social and other rights of citizens.\nThe personal rights of citizens have been specifically\nreflected in Turkmenistan\u2019s laws and law enforcement\npractice concerning such matters as the abolition of the\ndeath penalty, the banning of searches on citizens and\nthe banning of the adoption of ad hoc decisions in\npressing criminal charges. Through practical action,\nTurkmenistan reaffirms the implementation of these\nlegal acts.\nEvery year in our country, by presidential decree,\nthere is a widespread amnesty, the next to take place in\njust a month. As a result, more than 9,000 people will\nbe amnestied.\nToday in Turkmenistan there are no restrictions\nwhatsoever on travel of its citizens abroad. There is\nguaranteed freedom of registration and activity of\nreligious organizations and groups, in accordance with\nuniversally recognized international law, regardless of\nthe number of adherents or of their faith. A number of\nvery important legislative acts were adopted regarding\nthese issues, in accordance with which, at the present\ntime in Turkmenistan, there are various religious faiths\nregistered and functioning.\nAs for the human dimension, Turkmenistan has\nintensified its work with the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights\n(OHCHR). On our invitation, in March 2004,\nTurkmenistan was visited by a group of experts from\nthe OHCHR, who, together with the Turkmen side,\ndrew up specific areas for cooperation and rendered\nassistance in work on the further development of this\nhuman dimension, among which was methodological\nand legal assistance in the preparation of national\nreports on United Nations conventions in the field of\nhuman rights. We intend to continue our efforts\nregarding these issues and are ready to cooperate with\nall of the United Nations agencies and other\ninternational organizations.\nAgainst the backdrop of such effective\ninteraction, we are concerned that in 2003 the General\nAssembly\u2019s Third Committee considered a draft\nresolution regarding human rights in Turkmenistan.\nThe proposal was made by representatives of several\ncountries without having visited Turkmenistan, without\nhaving studied the situation on the ground, without\ntaking into account the significant initiatives of the\nGovernment of Turkmenistan in this sphere and\nwithout having first acquainted the Turkmen side with\nits contents. Such attempts at a one-sided consideration\nof serious questions is, in our view, unacceptable, and\nit is not in keeping with constructive cooperation in\nthis sphere. The adoption of hasty decisions does not\nmake a positive contribution to constructive dialogue.\nThis is extremely important, particularly in the light of\nthe principle of mutual respect for States, one of the\ndominating principles in the system of values professed\nby the United Nations.\nAt the crossroads of the twentieth and twenty-\nfirst centuries, our region, Central Asia, has moved\ninto the forefront of the international community\u2019s\nattention. How multilateral dialogue will take place on\nproblems of this region to a great extent will determine\nthe prospects for peace and security on a global scale.\nAware of its full responsibility to the\ninternational community, Turkmenistan attaches utmost\nimportance to the role of the United Nations in\nstepping up regional and interregional dialogue in\nseeking solutions to potential problems. In this regard,\nI should like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the\ninitiative of the President of Turkmenistan regarding\nthe creation of a Central Asian regional consultative\ncouncil of heads of State.\nThe issue here is about the creation of an inter-\nState body at the highest level for holding regular\nconsultations and working out joint decisions on\nrelevant issues that directly affect the fate of the\ncountries of the region and the real needs of the people\nthat inhabit those regions. These are, first of all, issues\n7\n\nof cooperation in trade and the economy, energy\nsupply, border trade, transportation and humanitarian\nissues. In our view, this mechanism for multilateral\nconsultations at the head-of-State level would promote\nthe development and implementation of agreed actions\nby parties on the basis of mutual interest and would\nallow for creation of the most effective system of\nrational interaction.\nIn October 2003, in Ashkhabad, the first round of\na forum on conflict prevention and sustainable\ndevelopment for Central Asia took place under the\naegis of the United Nations and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In the\ncontext of strengthening the effectiveness of\ninstruments of preventive diplomacy, we believe it to\nbe useful and advisable to create a United Nations\ncentre on preventive diplomacy in the Central Asian\nregion. Turkmenistan is ready to provide full assistance\ntowards locating it in our nation\u2019s capital.\nAn important stage in intensifying regional\ncooperation was the preparation of the trans-Afghan \u2014\nor Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan \u2014 gas pipeline\nproject. Turkmenistan welcomes the interest of large\ncompanies and financial and industrial groups in that\nmajor project. Here, I would like to note that the\nUnited Nations, using its broad international authority,\ncould have worked out a system of political and legal\nguarantees to ensure conditions favourable to the\nproject.\nIt is important to recall that in the past\nTurkmenistan proposed, from this rostrum, an initiative\nto formulate and adopt under the aegis of the United\nNations an international convention on a regime\ngoverning the functioning of inter-State pipelines, and\nassociated guarantees. We believe that such a\ndocument would make it possible to create a\ndependable political and legal mechanism to ensure the\ntransportation of raw materials to world markets.\nOn the question of implementing a secure\ndevelopment strategy and enhancing cooperation in the\nregion, I would like to underscore issues of\ninternational cooperation regarding the Caspian Sea.\nThese relate first and foremost to the exploration of the\nCaspian Sea\u2019s richest fields of hydrocarbon resources\nand are linked not only to the interests of the countries\nof the region but to those of many other States and\ntransnational companies. Our policy is aimed at\nmerging those interests.\nIt is a well-known fact that the oil and natural gas\nreserves of the Caspian Sea are the planet\u2019s most\nimportant energy resources for the twenty-first century.\nTheir reasonable and effective exploration and the\nconstruction of pipeline infrastructure to transport them\nto world markets would ensure significant economic\ngrowth in many States and the well-being of their\npeoples.\nEffective economic activity on the Caspian Sea is\nclosely linked to ensuring stability in the Caspian\nregion. Turkmenistan favours making the Caspian Sea\na zone of peace, stability and sustainable international\ncooperation.\nWe share the view that, in the twenty-first\ncentury, the United Nations system needs rational\nreform. We favour such United Nations reform, but\nonly in terms of strengthening and broadening the\nOrganization\u2019s role in the world. In this context, an\nimportant issue is ensuring maximum representation of\nStates in the United Nations, in the broader community\nof nations, in the specialized agencies and in the\nUnited Nations system in general. In addition, the\nUnited Nations should make full use of the potential\nand advantages of Member States. For example,\nTurkmenistan is ready to provide United Nations\nagencies with resources to expand their presence in the\nregion by opening headquarters and other major offices\nof United Nations agencies in our capital.\nThe diversity and complexity of the tasks facing\nthe States Members of the United Nations is self-\nevident. Carrying them out requires not only collective\nefforts but also unambiguous awareness of the\nindividual role and responsibility of each country of\nthe international community. Turkmenistan adheres to\nthat logic of political behaviour, with the objective of\nstrengthening peace and promoting economic, social\nand cultural development."

        "file_text": "I am delighted to\ncongratulate Mr. Ping, a distinguished son of Africa,\nupon his election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-ninth session. Indeed, at a time when the\ncommunity of nations has committed itself to paying\ndue attention to issues that relate to development in\nAfrica through support for the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u00eds Development and other mechanisms, his\npresidency gives us the hope and confidence that our\nconcerns and aspirations and those of others will\nremain high on the agenda of this body. Let me also\nexpress our sincere appreciation to his predecessor,\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the efficient and exemplary\nmanner in which he conducted the business of the fifty-\neighth session.\nAt the fifty-eighth session, I spoke alongside\nothers about the need to reform the United Nations and\nits related bodies so as to make them more democratic.\nI stressed the perils inherent in the status quo,\nparticularly with regard to the dominance of global\npolitics by one super-Power and its closest allies.\nWhile we welcome the current debate on enhancing the\nauthority and role of the United Nations, we wish to\nstress the need to address the core issue of the\ndemocratization of international governance. Debate on\nthe reform of the Security Council has been too long\ndrawn out because of attempts calculated to protect\nthose whose interests are best served by the status quo.\nIronically, it is some of those same forces that,\nsince last year, have been raining bombs and hellfire on\ninnocent Iraqis purportedly in the name of democracy.\nIraq today has become a vast inferno created by blatant\nand completely illegal and defiant acts of aggression\nby the United States, Britain and their allies, in the full\ntrail of which the world has witnessed mass destruction\nof both human lives and property, and with them our\nhuman rights, values, morality and the norms of\ninternational law as enshrined in our Charter. We are\nnow being coerced into accepting and believing that a\nnew political-cum-religious doctrine has arisen,\nnamely, that there is but one political god - George\nW. Bush - and that Tony Blair is his prophet. It is the\nKoran writ anew in Baghdad.\nThe United Nations Charter remains the only and\nmost sacred document and proponent of the relations of\nour nations. Anything else is political heresy.\nWe note that the Secretary-General has placed\nbefore the General Assembly the report of the Panel of\nEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil Society\nRelations. While civil society makes a significant\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations, we\nhope that any arrangements that will eventually be\nagreed upon will recognize that the United Nations\nremains an inter-State and intergovernmental body. It is\nalso our expectation that the conclusions of the debate\nwill recognize the different levels of development of\ncivil society in different parts of the world.\nAs we prepare for the mid-term review of the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration in\nSeptember 2005, it is apparent that many developing\ncountries, including my own country, Zimbabwe, may\nbe unable to meet the goals and targets set, as our\nsubregion of southern Africa has in recent years\nexperienced extended and successive periods of\ninclement weather, principally droughts, that have\nwreaked havoc upon our economies and accordingly\ndiminished our capacity to achieve the Millennium\nDeclaration targets. The situation, particularly with\nregards to the health and education sectors, has also\nbeen worsened by the brain drain and the devastating\neffects of the HIV and AIDS pandemic.\nIn that regard, Zimbabwe welcomes the\ncontinuing efforts of this community of nations to find\nsolutions to the scourge of HIV and AIDS that has\nravaged our peoples and economies. At the national\nlevel, we have taken measures, within our limited\nmeans, to combat the pandemic. We are also\ncoordinating our efforts at the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) level. Regrettably,\nwe continue to see an unfortunate and futile tendency\nto use assistance in this area as a reward for political\n26\n\ncompliance and malleability, making it unavailable to\ncountries whose Governments are deemed\n\u00ecinconvenient\u00ee. Let it be realized that the pandemic\ndoes not respect boundaries and that these self-serving,\nselective approaches will have little or no meaningful\nresults.\nZimbabwe has also had to withstand unprovoked\ndeclared and undeclared sanctions, imposed by Britain\nand its allies, which are bent on bringing down our\nlegitimately elected Government. Mr. Tony Blair, the\nBritish Prime Minister, has arrogantly and\nunashamedly announced in his Parliament that his\nGovernment was working with Zimbabwe's opposition\nparty to bring about regime change. Once again, the\nlawless nature of that man who, along with his\nWashington master, believes he is God-ordained to rule\nour world, has shown itself. Regime change is the\ninalienable right of the Zimbabwean people, who,\nthrough their sovereign vote, can make and unmake our\nGovernments.\nIn any case, we reject completely the assertions\nof, and pretence to, democracy by our former colonial\nmasters, whose undemocratic regimes we taught the\nlesson of one man \u00f3 or one woman \u00f3 one vote\nthrough our armed liberation struggles.\nAs we in Africa look at the situation here in the\nUnited States, we are aware of the plight of the black\npeople \u00f3 Afro-Americans \u00f3 of both yesterday and\ntoday and of the semi-slave, half-citizen status that has\nbeen their burden. Do the blacks in the United States\nhave the same political, social and economic rights and\nstatus as their white counterparts? When we will we\never have a black \u00f3 African-American \u00f3 President of\nthe United States? Never, ever. Why?\nI wish to take this opportunity to express the\nappreciation of my Government and that of the people\nof Zimbabwe for the humanitarian assistance we\nreceived from the international community during our\nperiod of need. Without such support, we would not\nhave been able to avert a major catastrophe.\nI am pleased to inform you, Sir, that we have, in\nspite of the sanctions and evil wishes of Britain and its\nallies, now emerged from that difficult phase. We had a\nrelatively good agricultural season this year, and our\nland reform programme has begun to make a\nsignificant contribution towards the turnaround of our\neconomy. Despite the partial drought at the beginning\nof the season, we have managed this year to realize a\ngood harvest \u00f3 certainly one good enough to ensure\nthat we meet our food requirements until the next\nseason. We plead with the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) to stop its strange political mouthings, lies and\nfabrications about our situation. Our own regional\norganizations know the truth about Zimbabwe. We urge\nthe IMF to listen to them, and, for once, to be clean.\nMy Government is determined to eliminate\ncorruption and its corrosive effects on national\ndevelopment efforts. After signing the International\nConvention against Corruption in November last year,\nwe put in place legal and administrative measures that\nhave already arrested a growing and deliberate\ntendency to circumvent normal business practices,\nparticularly in the financial-services sector. We have,\nhowever, experienced some setbacks in our efforts, as\nsome countries, particularly in the developed West,\ncontinue to provide safe havens for fugitive economic\nsaboteurs from our country.\nIn March next year, Zimbabwe will be holding its\nsixth democratic parliamentary elections since\nindependence in 1980. Those elections, like others\nbefore them, will be conducted in accordance with our\nnational laws and the SADC principles and guidelines\ngoverning democratic elections, recently adopted by\nour subregion. We do not need any lessons from the\nNetherlands or its imperialist allies from the European\nUnion on this question. Zimbabwe will indeed\nwelcome to the elections those observers whose sole\nand undivided purpose is to observe the process and\nnot to meddle in the politics of the country.\nThe fight against international terrorism has\nexposed the duplicity and insincerity of erstwhile\nleading democracies and human rights monitors with\nregard to the question of the observance of human\nrights. We have seen established international\nconventions thrown to the dogs, and resolutions of the\nGeneral Assembly and other United Nations bodies on\nthis issue have come to naught.\nWe are seriously concerned at the fact that the\nUnited Nations, the pre-eminent instrument for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\nwatched helplessly while Iraq was unlawfully attacked\nand plundered by the United States and United\nKingdom-led so-called coalition of the willing. Such\nbelligerent, gunslinging diplomacy and the illegitimate\nterritorial occupation of the State of Iraq are blemishes\non the fair-play image of the United Nations.\n27\n\nWhile the sadistic scenes from Abu Ghraib\nremain vivid in our minds, other places in Iraq, as well\nas Guantanamo Bay, have provided useful samples of\nthe Western concept of respect for human rights. Let\nme say once again that the West should spare us their\nlessons on human rights. They do not have the moral\nauthority to speak about, let alone parade themselves as\ntorch-bearers of, human rights.\nZimbabwe remains deeply concerned about the\nsituation in the Middle East. We continue to be\nrevolted by a situation where the collective decisions\nand authority of the United Nations are disregarded\nwith impunity on account of big-brother support. We\ndemand an immediate lifting of all restrictions illegally\nimposed on the Palestinian people, which have seen\nPresident Yasser Arafat remain a virtual prisoner of\nforeign occupation. We welcome the recent opinion\ngiven by the International Court of Justice that found\nthe construction of the Israeli wall to be in\ncontravention of international law, and the subsequent\nGeneral Assembly resolution that demanded an\nimmediate halt to that monstrosity.\nAs the Assembly is aware, the African Union\nearlier this year established its own Peace and Security\nCouncil to seek and promote African solutions to\nAfrican problems. Already, the Council is seized with\nthe matter of the crisis in western Sudan. Those efforts\nneed the support of the international community.\nLet me conclude by assuring Mr. Ping of my\ncountry\u00eds support as he presides over the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. I wish also to\nreiterate my country\u00eds commitment positively to\ncontribute to the fulfilment of the aims and purposes of\nthe United Nations."

        "file_text": "The fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly coincides\nwith the twenty-fifth anniversary of the independence of\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines. The last quarter of a\ncentury has presented a mighty challenge for the\npeople of my country: to develop in a world\nincreasingly indifferent to the particular problems of\nsmall, poor, developing States. But it is a challenge\nthat the citizens of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nhave embraced with courage, fortitude and hope \u2014\n9\n\nnever doubting our ability to survive, thrive and\nultimately prosper as we contribute to the uplifting of\nour unique, independent, distinctive and noble\nCaribbean civilization. Our country has made progress\nthus far, but much more remains to be done. We look\nforward to succeeding in our quest for self-mastery.\nI would like to congratulate you, Mr. President,\non your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-ninth\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\nyou will perform your duties with dignity and skill. Let\nme just say that you have a hard act to follow. Your\npredecessor, our Mr. Julian Hunte, is a distinguished\nson of the Caribbean who hails from our sister island,\nSaint Lucia. He made us proud in his role as President\nof the General Assembly.\nThe peoples of the Caribbean and the southern\nUnited States are still traumatized by the devastation\ncaused by hurricanes this season. Jamaica, the\nBahamas, the Cayman Islands, Haiti, Cuba and other\nCaribbean countries, including my own, have been\nseverely affected. But our nearest neighbour, Grenada,\nhas suffered cataclysmic destruction and is now in a\nstate of national crisis. We offer our profound\ncondolences to the families and loved ones of those\nwho have died in the hurricanes. Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines and other Caribbean nations have reached\nout a helping hand to Grenada, but the magnitude of\nthe devastation in that country on 7 September is\nbeyond the capacity of the Caribbean to address\nsatisfactorily by itself. Indeed, Grenada has become an\ninternational responsibility.\nI therefore reiterate the call of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) for the urgent convening of\nan international donors\u2019 conference to address the\nmatter of Grenada\u2019s utter devastation and its\nreconstruction. Simply put, Grenada has moved from\nthe status of a middle-income developing country with\na modern, sophisticated society and well run,\ndemocratic State machinery to a devastated land in a\nmatter of three hours of pounding from hurricane Ivan.\nToday in Grenada there is no functioning economy and\na highly traumatized civil society.\nArising from all that is a strategic issue in our\nquest to turn Grenada\u2019s setback into a regional advance\nfor a more profound and meaningful Caribbean\nintegration. Hurricane Ivan has spoken eloquently to\nthe fact that nature has made our region one. History\nhas further moulded us as one people who were drawn\noriginally from diverse lands and cultures. Yet we in\nthe Caribbean continue to buck, rather than accommodate\nourselves appropriately to, both nature and history. That\nis a sort of vanity that we can ill-afford.\nIt is tragic that it takes a catastrophe of this\nnature to hammer home the point that the small island\ndeveloping States have been making for some time,\nnamely, that there is a need for special and differential\ntreatment because of, among other things, our\nvulnerability to natural disasters.\nI repeat, without exaggeration, that Hurricane\nIvan, in a few short hours, reduced Grenada to rubble\nand, at a stroke, undid the hard work and achievements\nof its people since independence in 1974. We in Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines feel their pain and know\nthat, but for the grace of God and the vagaries of\nnature, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would have\nsuffered the same fate.\nAccordingly, the crisis in Grenada, occasioned by\nnature, prompts Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to\ngive the highest priority to the international conference\nto be held in Mauritius in January of next year, when\nthe specific and distinct problems of small island\ndeveloping States will be highlighted. We will be\nstressing the need for the international community to\ntake urgent action on the problem of global warming and\nclimate change, which, if left unchecked, could lead to a\nglobal human and economic calamity in this century.\nThe international community must become focused on\nthe avoidance of that threatened apocalypse.\nSince we met here last year, the Caribbean\nCommunity has faced another crisis in our region \u2014 this\ntime, a political one \u2014 as one of our member States,\nHaiti, descended into chaos, violence and anarchy. We\nsaw an elected head of State removed in circumstances\nthat bring no credit to our hemisphere. We remain\ndeeply troubled by the controversial interruption of the\ndemocratic process that took place in the early hours of\nthe morning of 28 February this year in Port-au-Prince.\nIt is worth remembering that CARICOM States were\ninstrumental in preparing a plan of Action for Haiti to\nensure that the Constitution of that country was\nrespected and to create the basis for a mobilization of\nresources to avert a humanitarian disaster.\nOn 25 February 2004, CARICOM was successful\nin having the matter raised at a meeting of the Security\nCouncil. On that occasion, we went to the Council\narmed with a draft resolution. We pleaded for the\n10\n\ninternational community to respond to the rapidly\ndeteriorating situation in Haiti. The draft resolution\npresented by CARICOM to the Security Council was\nnoted but politely ignored. The rest is history. The\nGovernment and people of Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines are anxious to help the Haitian people in\nthe sorry plight in which they currently find\nthemselves. But before engaging politically with the\nso-called interim Government of Haiti, we must see,\namong other things, unequivocal evidence on the\nground of advances in democracy and freedom and\ncredible guarantees of free and fair elections within a\nreasonable time. A regime that tries an indicted\nmurderer at midnight, one who was hailed by the very\nregime as a liberator, and then frees him before the first\ncock crows, has failed the most elemental tests of\njustice, freedom and democracy.\nThe death and destruction occasioned by Hurricane\nJean in Haiti demand our humanitarian assistance, not\nour political engagement with the Haitian regime.\nThe dire situation in the Darfur region of Sudan\nhas caused great distress to the Government and people\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My own personal\ngrief prompted me to write letters in May of this year\nto several world leaders, including Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, offering the slender resources of my\ncountry to assist in whatever small way we could to\nalleviate the suffering of the afflicted Sudanese people.\nMost of those I addressed responded positively. It is\ntrue that \u2014 thanks in large measure to the diligence of\nvarious journalists and the news media \u2014 this tragedy\nhas now been brought forcefully to international\nattention. But the question we must nevertheless ask\nourselves is this: has the international community\nreacted in an appropriate way to this calamity, or have\nwe merely engaged in the usual perfunctory and\nroutine denunciations? The images and reports coming\nout of Darfur are a chilling reminder of man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man and a haunting condemnation of\nthose who can truly help but who stand by idly or\ndownplay this humanitarian disaster callously. In that\nregard, the Government of Sudan must shoulder its\nresponsibility to its citizens and to humanity.\nThree months have gone by since I wrote to the\nSecretary-General, and this massive human tragedy\ncontinues to unfold before our appalled eyes. I suggest\nthat we cannot allow the bloodbath to continue. We\nmust save those who can still be saved in what have\nbecome the killing fields of Africa. The genocide of\nyesterday in Rwanda stands as a monument of shame\nto the international community. As an international\ncommunity we must today take the shame out of our\neyes in Darfur with urgent practical measures.\nA similar effort is required to address the harsh\nconditions of life of other peoples, including the heroic\nnation of Palestine, whose humanity is being daily\nassailed by outside forces.\nI would like to express, on behalf of the people of\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, our deepest\nsympathy to the Government and people of the Russian\nFederation on the tragic and inexplicable events in\nBeslan on 3 September. A tragedy of that magnitude,\nand especially the slaughter of so many innocent\nchildren, cannot fail to cause heartfelt sorrow.\nSince 11 September 2001, the fight against\ninternational terrorism has intensified on all fronts. It is\nright and proper that rich and poor countries be engaged\nin the ongoing war on the barbarism of terror. Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines is a reliable partner in the\nglobal struggle against the evil of terrorism. Still, it is\nnecessary for me to point out that the cost of being a\nreliable participant in that war is a heavy burden on the\nmeagre resources of developing countries like Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines. Our international\nobligations and circumstances necessarily pull us into\nthat war, which we did not occasion or initiate. Yet we\nbear that imposed burden with equanimity and pain.\n This body, however, must be reminded yet again\nthat there is another terrorism that we must fight\nrelentlessly. It is the terrorism of war, poverty,\nilliteracy and disease, including HIV/AIDS. We must\nnever forget, either, that daily hunger for 1 billion\npersons worldwide is truly a weapon of mass\ndestruction. Together we must fight that terrorism too.\nDeveloped countries cannot allow trade regimes and\nmarket conditions to further impoverish the poor, as has\nbeen the case with banana farmers in the Caribbean, and\nstill trumpet that they are helping the poor.\nThe case for a judicious and balanced reform of\nthe United Nations to better reflect the reality of the\ntwenty-first century is unanswerably strong. We must\nredouble our collective efforts to persuade those who fear,\nunreasonably, the consequences of a just reform. We must\nnot permit entrenched power to defeat right reason.\nSince Saint Vincent and the Grenadines became\nan independent State, it has had unbroken diplomatic\n11\n\nrelations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. We see\nthat country of liberty and democracy as a most\nimportant component of the magnificent Chinese\ncivilization. Taiwan has the world\u2019s seventeenth largest\neconomy and the fifteenth largest trading volume\ninternationally, and is third in the global ranking of the\nextent of foreign exchange reserves held. Taiwan\u2019s 23\nmillion people ought properly to be represented in this\nuniversal body by the Government of their choice. It is\na mistake to continue to deny Taiwan international\nmembership of organizations. The relations between\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines and Taiwan have\nbeen exemplary. Our friendship demands that we plead\ntheir just cause.\nI conclude with these observations. Some States\nboast ownership of boundless territory, vast natural\nresources and potent firepower; but none of those\nfactors by themselves, or a combination of all three,\nguarantee peace or prosperity. In some other States\npoverty, hunger conflict and disease are the norm. If,\ninstead of investing in war \u2014 knowing its certain side\neffect of the waste of young, innocent lives \u2014 nations\ncooperated with each other, striving for ways to solve\nproblems common to all, it is just possible that the\nworld we bequeath to our children will be more\npeaceful and richer in the ways that matter and\nboasting cleaner air and a healthier environment.\nInternationally, and in our own countries, let us\nemphasize the power of love rather than the love of\npower. Let us extol not the rightness of power but the\nrighteousness contained in our human condition."

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman, I\nam pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of this session. We assure you that we will\nsincerely cooperate with you in order to contribute to\nthe success of this session and to the realization of the\ndesirable objectives to which we all aspire. We all hope\nto serve humankind and the cause of international\npeace and security.\nI also take this opportunity, Sir, to express my\nheartfelt thanks to his Excellency Mr. Julian Robert\nHunte, your predecessor and President of the Assembly\nat its fifty-eighth session, for all his efforts to ensure\nthe success of that session and of the concurrent\nresumptions of the tenth emergency special session.\nThis session of the General Assembly has been\nconvened under very complex and difficult\ncircumstances. There has been a clear decline in the\ninternational community\u2019s ability to unite and to reach\nconsensus on solutions to the diverse problems that\nhave undermined international diplomacy. Those\nproblems have deprived preventive diplomacy of its\nability to create an environment of international\nunderstanding conducive to agreement on issues of\ncommon interest to all peoples.\nWe believe that there is an urgent need for the\ninternational community to review both regional and\ninternational policies and to put an end to the sense of\nuncertainty, pessimism and vagueness surrounding the\nwork of the United Nations. States that can influence\ninternational policy have a moral and material\nresponsibility to take the initiative to review those\npolicies and create an environment of cooperation\namong international stakeholders.\nThe region of the Middle East is the focus of\nglobal attention, because of its potential impact on\ninternational stability. We share the interest shown by\nmany countries in the situation in the Middle East,\nwhich is prompted by the need to find solutions to the\npolitical and social problems facing the region.\nHere, it is worth noting that the Group of Eight,\nat its meeting on Sea Island in the state of Georgia in\nthe United States on 9 June 2004, focused their interest\non the Middle East. In principle, we welcome their\nposition since we believe that closer cooperation is\nessential within the Group of Eight and the countries of\nthe Middle East to consider how to prioritize the\ndiscussion of the political issues that remain the main\nobstacle to the march of the people of the Middle East\ntowards progress and stability.\nThe problem of Palestine and Israel\u2019s continued\noccupation of Arab territories in Syria and Lebanon\ncannot be put on the back burner indefinitely.\nTherefore, we should seek fair and just solutions to\nthose problems. The road map announced on 30 April\n2003 was welcomed by the Arab countries but has yet\nto be implemented. We therefore call on the United\nStates of America, the Russian Federation, the\nEuropean Union and the United Nations \u2014 the\nmembers of the Quartet that sponsored the road map \u2014\nto fulfil their commitment to the Middle East.\nThe Security Council adopted resolution 1546\n(2004), by which it transferred sovereignty in Iraq from\nthe Coalition forces to an interim Iraqi Government. It\nwas a milestone in the development of the situation in\nIraq. However, the deteriorating security situation in\nIraq remains a cause of deep concern. We believe that\nthe interim Iraqi Government is making great efforts to\nrestore normalcy and stability. We support the\nGovernment of Iraq in its endeavours to unify all Iraqis\naround a common agenda. We feel that certain\nsuccesses have been achieved through the adoption of\npolitical dialogue, and that it is essential to Iraq to\nexpand that dialogue.\nIn the Sudan, the Government has been making\ncommendable efforts to achieve stability in Darfur. We\nlook forward to ongoing cooperation between the\nAfrican Union and the Sudanese Government. The\nGovernment\u2019s willingness to implement certain\nmeasures proposed by the United Nations and to\ncooperate with the Security Council to implement\nresolution 1564 (2004) deserves our support and\ncommendation.\nIn our view, the United Nations should provide\nfinancial and technical support to the efforts of the\nAfrican Union and the Sudanese Government to\nachieve peace in Darfur. Moreover, we believe that any\naction by the Security Council against the Sudan would\nbe harmful and would undermine the United Nations\nability to work effectively on the ground. It would,\nmoreover, hamper the efforts of the Sudan and the\nAfrican Union to achieve peace.\nAll human beings share this Earth and should\nwork together to develop and preserve its resources. It\nis highly important that the international community\ntake note of the environmental changes taking place\n22\n\neverywhere, such as the destructive storms, floods and\nfires that have had tremendously harmful effects on all\nhumanity. Those phenomena may be caused by human\ntransgression and destruction of environmental\ndiversity. That is why the international community is\ncalled upon to study the environment and do whatever\nit can to stem the phenomenon of desertification and\ndrought in order to preserve great global sources of\nfood.\nRecent international policies have resulted in the\nemergence of serious types of terrorist acts. One of the\nmost horrific of such acts was the hostage-taking in a\nschool in Beslan in North Ossetia in the Russian\nFederation. We strongly condemn that terrorist act and\nexpress our solidarity with the Russian Government in\nfighting such attacks. We believe that the international\ncommunity should show solidarity in the face of\nterrorism everywhere and engage in in-depth\nconsideration of the phenomenon. The convening of an\ninternational conference to consider terrorism is a good\nidea, since the outcome of such a conference could be\nan important tool that would help defeat the\nphenomenon.\nThe Sultanate of Oman believes that States\u2019\naccession and commitment to disarmament treaties and\nconventions would enhance and maintain international\npeace and security. In that context, we should seriously\nconsider the possibility of establishing collective\nmechanisms for arms monitoring and control, based on\nunified standards acceptable to all, be it in the field of\nweapons of mass destruction or that of conventional\nweapons. Otherwise, the role of the world order will\nremain limited to theoretical studies or to drawing\nattention to the dangers of the arms race to\ndevelopment, the environment and international peace\nand security.\nThe world stockpile of weapons of mass\ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons, could\ndestroy human life on our planet many times over. That\nis why the Sultanate of Oman has signed most\nconventions on disarmament and arms control,\nincluding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention\nand the Biological Weapons Convention.\nThe emergence of globalization and the World\nTrade Organization raised the hopes and aspirations of\npeoples for an era of international cooperation that\nwould broaden sustainable development. However, the\nresults of the new developments have been an\namalgamation of democracy and dictatorship, of\nhuman rights and enslavement, of great prosperity and\nextreme poverty, of the provision of advanced health\ncare side by side with fatal contagious diseases, of free\ntrade and world trade monopoly, and of a rise in the\nprice of industrial products and a decline in the prices\nof the raw materials required to maintain their\nproduction. The amalgam has led to economic\nimbalances. Is that what we sought to achieve?\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange was established in the context of an initiative\nby the Secretary-General to seek ways of reforming the\nOrganization, and in particular of expanding the\npermanent membership of the Security Council. We\nwould welcome such an expansion in order to broaden\nthe base of participation in the Council\u2019s decision-\nmaking process. However, the permanent members\nshould work to create an international climate\nconducive to an expansion that reflects the\ninternational will. Conditions of membership should be\nreviewed to include aspects that conform to\ninternational changes so as to guarantee equitable\nrepresentation and international consensus if possible.\nWe believe that it is high time for permanent\nmembers of the Security Council to review their own\nattitudes and policies in the Council in order to\nfacilitate the required restructuring. We believe that the\nexcessive adoption of Security Council resolutions on\nsecondary international issues undermines the prestige\nof the Council and reduces the ability of the United\nNations to deal with priority questions that are\nimportant to international peace and security. We\nbelieve that the Security Council must not interfere in\nthe internal affairs of Member States, so as to preserve\nthe international consensus in addressing issues related\nto international peace and security.\nThe Sultanate of Oman would like to express its\nsupport to the efforts made by the United Nations. We\nwould particularly like to express our support to the\nSecretary-General and to the role he plays in\nconducting the affairs of this Organization. Our\ndelegation will spare no effort to ensure the success of\nthis session, in order to realize the objectives to which\nwe all aspire."

        "file_text": "I\nwish to extend to you, Sir, my delegation\u2019s warmest\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I am\nconfident that, under your stewardship, this session\nwill successfully accomplish its mission.\nThe outgoing year has been a challenging time as\nthe international community has grappled with a host\nof formidable challenges, including terrorist attacks,\nthe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, violent internal conflicts, the surge of\ninfectious diseases and natural disasters, in addition to\npersisting poverty and hunger and humanitarian\nemergencies.\nMoreover, the war in Iraq and its aftermath have\nhad a lasting impact on the fabric of international\naffairs in the Middle East and the world over. The\nbitter divisions that it engendered over how to ensure\nour collective security against terror and the threat of\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction have\nposed a challenge and a test for the United Nations. It\nis gratifying to see that, in these difficult times, the\nworld Organization has been able to regain its validity\nas the indispensable common house of the entire\nhuman family.\nTo make the United Nations a more effective\ninstrument for pursuing all the priorities identified in\nthe Millennium Declaration, world leaders pledged\ntheir resolve to undertake a set of bold measures to\nreform the world Organization so as to enable it to\nadequately address the manifold challenges ahead. The\ntask of reforming the United Nations will undoubtedly\nrequire truly innovative approaches and the unfaltering\ncommitment of Member States. In that respect, my\ndelegation eagerly awaits the report of the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and ensuing\nrecommendations by the Secretary-General to be\nsubmitted to the General Assembly later this year.\n31\n\nIn the meantime, my delegation highly commends\nthe hard work and tireless efforts of Mr. Julian Hunte,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession. Resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, adopted under\nhis skilful leadership, have proved to be by far the\nmost far-reaching actions in recent years. Significant as\nthey are, we should nevertheless aim higher and work\nwith vigour to further reaffirm the central position of\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations\nand to enable it to play that role more effectively.\nOn Security Council reform, I wish to join\nprevious speakers in reiterating that its composition\nhas long ceased to reflect current geopolitical realities.\nMongolia reaffirms its support for a just and equitable\nenlargement of the Security Council by increasing the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent seats, while\nensuring the representation of developing and\ndeveloped countries. In that regard, my Government\nsupports the legitimate aspirations of such countries as\nJapan, Germany and India that are willing and able to\nshoulder greater responsibility in pursuit of\ninternational peace, security and development.\nPermanent seats, in our view, should also be allocated\nto Latin America and Africa. We do not, however, seek\nenlargement for its own sake \u2014 the expanded Security\nCouncil must be fully equipped to effectively react to\nthe crises and conflicts of the new millennium. It is\nalso our view that the veto power ought to be\nthoroughly reviewed, and efforts should be exerted to\nmake the Council more democratic by enhancing its\naccountability and the transparency of its work.\nThere appears to be a broad consensus emerging\nthat next year\u2019s high-level meeting to review the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\nand the celebrations for the sixtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations will galvanize us into making bold\nplans for the future \u2014 plans that will enable the family\nof nations to attain the ambitious, but achievable, goals\nset by the Millennium Declaration through a genuine\ndisplay of solidarity, shared responsibility and effective\npartnership.\nIn his address to the Assembly last week the\nSecretary-General eloquently underscored the need to\nuphold the rule of law on both the international and\ndomestic levels. Mongolia firmly believes that the rule\nof law and multilateralism are the fundamental\nprinciples of international relations in the twenty-first\ncentury. We must not falter or fail in pursuing them.\nThe value of international law \u2014 the only viable\nframework of rules to govern the behaviour and\ninteraction among States \u2014 must never be rated on its\nperformance in the short term or for its ability to\nachieve near-sighted goals, nor should the value of\ndialogue and collective decision-making be called into\nquestion. Violation of those principles, even with the\nbest of intentions, is dangerous. Let us remember that\nthe road to hell is paved with good intentions. Such\nactions would only bring about unforeseen and\nunintended effects that in the long term could be\nextremely harmful to established international\nmechanisms and processes and endanger the existing\nworld order. That simple truth applies to every aspect\nof international life from the war on terror and the\nmaintenance of peace and security to the management\nof international trade and environmental protection.\nIndeed, any unlawful act, once committed, will\ncertainly have far greater repercussions than imagined\nat the outset \u2014 repercussions that will ultimately\nundermine its original objectives.\nThe persistent instability of some regions of the\nworld and the people who suffer from internal armed\nconflicts represent the failure of world leaders to\nenforce the commitment they undertook in the\nMillennium Declaration to \u201cspare no effort to free our\npeoples from the scourge of war, whether within or\nbetween States\u201d. The violence and hatred that spread\nacross the Darfur region of Sudan is one such tragic\nexample.\nIn the Middle East, Mongolia notes with sadness\nthe lack of progress on the path towards the peaceful\nresolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We urge\nboth sides to exercise utmost restraint, and support the\nefforts of the Quartet to ensure the implementation of\nthe road map.\nMongolia is also concerned with the security\nsituation in Iraq. The end of occupation and the formal\nrestoration of Iraqi sovereignty on 28 June 2004 were\nlaudable achievements, yet the persisting climate of\nviolence and insecurity threatens to undermine the\nefforts of the international community to bring peace,\nsecurity and stability to that country. Mongolia\nwholeheartedly supports the political process based on\nSecurity Council resolutions 1483 (2003) and 1546\n(2004), and the actions undertaken by the interim\nGovernment to convene a national conference, create\nan interim council and hold elections early next year.\n32\n\nIn Afghanistan, the approaching presidential and\nparliamentary elections are important milestones for a\nnew, democratic State. The registration of more than 10\nmillion voters, a significant portion of whom are\nwomen, clearly demonstrates the strong determination\nof the Afghan people to rebuild their country.\nContinued engagement of the international community\nremains crucial in maintaining peace and stability in\nAfghanistan and promoting the Bonn process.\nThe Korean nuclear crisis, and the resulting\ntensions on the Korean peninsula, cast dark clouds over\nall of North-East Asia. As a North-East Asian nation\nthat rejects nuclear arms, Mongolia stands for a\nnuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula and sees it as an\nimportant condition for the reconciliation of both\nKoreas and, therefore, for the peace and stability of the\nregion. The continuation of the six-party talks towards\na negotiated solution is of vital importance for the\nmaintenance of peace and stability both on the Korean\npeninsula and in the region as a whole.\nIndeed, strengthening international peace and\nsecurity by supporting practical disarmament measures\nin every possible way has been one of the main\npriorities of Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy. The\nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines and efforts\nto curb the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\nhave an immediate bearing on human security and\nsocial and economic development around the world.\nAs an ardent advocate of the disarmament of\nweapons of mass destruction, and, in particular, nuclear\ndisarmament, Mongolia believes that the full and\neffective implementation of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by both the\nnuclear and the non-nuclear weapon States will play a\npivotal role in promoting international peace and\nnuclear security. In that context, Mongolia welcomes\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004), adopted\nunanimously under Chapter VII of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, as a meaningful step towards curbing\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nHowever, we also believe that another significant step\nneeds to be made towards nuclear disarmament: the\nearly entry into force and universalization on a priority\nbasis of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nThe establishment of new and consolidation of\nexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones should remain high\non the international agenda. My Government will\ncontinue its efforts towards institutionalizing its\nnuclear-weapon-free status at the international level.\nMongolia\u2019s internationally recognized and legally\nbinding nuclear-weapon-free status could further\ncontribute towards ensuring peace and stability in the\nregion of North-East Asia and beyond.\nThe global war on terror remains high on the\nagenda of the international community. The\n11 September attacks heralded the start of an\nunprecedented global campaign that united countries,\nlarge and small, in their resolve to stand together to\ncombat terrorism.\nAnd yet, despite the efforts of the international\ncommunity, terrorism \u2014 like the Hydra of Lerna \u2014\nseems to grow a new head for each one it loses.\nThe current year has been no exception to that\nsad pattern and civilians continue to be the target of\nattacks: in Iraq, both Iraqi and foreign nationals have\nbeen targeted; in Madrid, an attack was perpetrated\nagainst a commuter train; and, in the Russian\nFederation, there have been a string of attacks, the\nlatest being the school massacre in Beslan, where\nchildren fell victim to an unprecedented atrocity.\nThose events have highlighted once again the\nneed for an effective international anti-terrorist\ncampaign. The United Nations plays a central role in\nthe fight against terror, coordinating the actions of its\nMember States and providing them with technical and\nlegislative support. Mongolia supports the efforts of\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee aimed at its\nrevitalization, and is looking forward to seeing the\nCounter-Terrorism Executive Directorate in operation.\nWe also attach importance to the speedy finalization of\ndraft international conventions on terrorism and\nnuclear terrorism currently in progress.\nNo matter how pressing the fight is against terror,\nit should not overshadow other issues that impact the\ndaily lives of millions of people \u2014 from extreme\npoverty and hunger, to environmental degradation and\nHIV/AIDS, to health and education. The growing\ndevelopment disparity between rich and poor countries;\nincreasing poverty and unemployment in the\ndeveloping world, particularly in the least developed\ncountries; the burden of debt and trade inequalities are\nof growing concern to us. We feel that development\nitself is an effective remedy for the root cause of those\nsocial ills, and thus attach particular importance to the\nimplementation, at the national, regional and\ninternational levels, of the goals agreed to at the\n33\n\nMillennium Summit and in Monterrey, Johannesburg\nand Rome.\nIn this context, my delegation welcomes the New\nYork Declaration on the Action Against Hunger and\nPoverty adopted on 20 September this year at the\nhighest political level, which is aimed at fostering our\ncommon fight to overcome poverty and increase\nfinancing for development.\nMongolia welcomes the adoption by the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) members of the negotiating\nframework for the Doha trade round last July. This is\nof particular importance since the Doha Development\nAgenda provides significant opportunities for\neconomic development and fair trade. We continue to\nfavour special and differentiated treatment for\ndeveloping countries, especially those with small and\nvulnerable economies whose populations are largely\ndependent for their livelihoods on being granted full\nmarket access and low import tariffs by the major\ntrading partners.\nOne year from now, world leaders will meet here\nat the summit level to review progress in the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nIn preparation for this important event, Mongolia has\nproduced its first national report on the implementation\nof the Goals.\nIn recent years, the world has witnessed the\nemergence of a new global commitment to democracy\nand good governance. A little over a year ago,\nMongolia hosted the Fifth International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies, which had the principal\ntheme of democracy, good governance and civil\nsociety. Mongolia is now actively engaged in ensuring\nan effective follow-up to the conference both\nnationally and internationally.\nIn this respect, my delegation wishes to commend\nthe proposal by the President of the United States\naimed at establishing a democracy fund at the United\nNations to help countries to lay the foundations of\ndemocracy by instituting the rule of law, the\nindependence of the judiciary, a free press, a multiparty\nsystem and trade unions. This fund would help support\nour endeavours to strengthen democracy and good\ngovernance and to develop an effective partnership\nwith civil society in the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThis year, Mongolians have participated in their\nfourth parliamentary election. During the election, the\ntwo main political parties in our country, the\nMotherland-Democracy Coalition and the Mongolian\nPeople\u2019s Revolutionary Party, won almost an equal\nnumber of seats in the Parliament. The two political\nparties have agreed to form a coalition Government on\nthe basis of consensus-building, thereby demonstrating\nthat democratic principles and values have firmly taken\nroot in Mongolian soil. I have no doubt that the new\ncoalition Government will wish to strengthen\ndemocracy and good governance, ensure sustained\neconomic growth, reduce poverty and unemployment,\nand pursue a foreign policy that is open, multifaceted\nand proactive."

I assure you of\nmy entire delegation\u2019s unwavering support for you in\nyour noble work.\nI also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Julian\nRobert Hunte, for his excellent guidance of the work of\nthe Assembly at the fifty-eighth session.\nI also take this opportunity once again to\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his\nongoing dedication and courage in discharging his\nresponsibilities. I thank him for his ever-growing and\nresolute support for the cause of peace and security\nthroughout the world and in my country, Burundi, in\nparticular.\nWhen the Security Council adopted resolution\n1545 (2004) authorizing the deployment of the United\nNations Operation in Burundi, the United Nations\nmade a real contribution to the peace process in my\ncountry, which two months later is now drawing\ntowards the final phase of that process.\nThe signing of the Arusha Peace and\nReconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August\n2000 was a decisive step forward in the peace process\nin my country, which since 1993 had been devastated\nby the longest crisis in its history, even jeopardizing\nthe very existence of the nation. The Agreement\nushered in a new era of calm and a gradual return to\npeace with the conclusion of ceasefire agreements with\nthe armed political movements, especially since the\nsigning on 16 November 2003 of a comprehensive\nceasefire agreement with the main rebel movement\nConseil national pour la d\u00e9fense de la d\u00e9mocratie-\nForces nationales pour la d\u00e9fense de la d\u00e9mocratie.\nToday, calm has descended throughout almost all\nour national territory because we have acted on our\nfirm commitment to implement the agreements. Fully\ninclusive institutions have gradually been established\nand we are now preparing to enter the post-transition\nera with elected institutions, to the satisfaction of our\npeople and that of the international community.\nWe wish to send the strong message that we are\nresolved to break the logic of violence and to support\nthe restoration of peace, reconciliation, democracy and\ndevelopment in our country. We also protect and\nstrengthen peace and security by integrating the\nfighters from the armed movements into the security\nand defence forces that we will need to establish our\nnational army and police force, to the comfort of all.\nThe process will be complemented by the disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants and\ntroops not included in the integration process.\nThe disarmament, demobilization and\nprofessional or social reintegration programme is\ncoordinated at the uppermost level by the highest\nauthorities of our country, including the ministries\nconcerned and representatives of the World Bank, the\narmy and the armed movements. The programme is\ncurrently in its first phase, bringing the combatants\ntogether into agreed zones. Those combatants will very\nshortly be transferred to the sites identified for their\ncantonment, while the Government troops will remain\nin their barracks. We already have in place a precedent\nfor the integration of the forces, having created a\nspecial institutional protection brigade on 1 July.\nMoreover, mixed military units have begun training in\na pilot centre with a view to establishing the national\ndefence force. This approach is intended to correct the\nethnic and regional imbalances that have often been\nobserved in our country and that have constituted the\nsource of the social and political conflict that has\nbrought us so much suffering.\nThe demobilization sites are ready, but we face a\nterrible shortage of material and financial resources to\npay for the increase in the numbers of people we will\nhave to handle in the first few years before progressive\ndemobilization ends. We must recall that\ndemobilization and disarmament will make a real\ncontribution to creating a security environment\nconducive to the organization of free, democratic,\ntransparent and honest elections.\nThe draft post-transition constitution, which will\nserve as the basis for organizing the elections, and\nother legal and administrative texts were discussed at\ngreat length among the politicians in the President\u2019s\ncircle and at the levels of mediation and heads of State\nof the subregion. Some provisions on power-sharing\nthat did not enjoy unanimous support were upheld by\n20 of 30 political parties and endorsed by the twenty-\nsecond summit of heads of State of the subregion. They\nwere then included in the draft constitution, which was\nadopted unanimously by our Parliament, with a 70-per\ncent attendance rate, on 17 September. We have\n7\n\nscheduled a referendum on the draft constitution for 20\nOctober.\nThus, despite the opposition of some political\nparties, we believe that Burundi will soon have a post-\ntransition constitution and other legal texts that are\ncustomary in democratic countries. We are placing our\nfaith in the Independent National Electoral\nCommission established to organize the technical\naspects of the elections. We would stress that the\nCommission will succeed only if we obtain the support\nof our external bilateral and multilateral partners. We\nsincerely thank those who have already pledged their\nassistance, and we would urge others to follow suit.\nThe efforts to maintain peace are still being\nresisted by the Palipehutu-Forces nationales de\nliberation movement, which still refuses to come to the\nnegotiating table. Following the movement\u2019s\ninvolvement in the assassination of Papal Nuncio\nMonsignor Courtney and in the massacre of Congolese\nrefugees in Gatumba and elsewhere, the summit of\nheads of State of the regional initiative on Burundi,\nmeeting in Dar-es-Salaam, classified it as a terrorist\norganization and recommended that the United Nations\nand the African Union take the appropriate restrictive\nmeasures. Here, I would like to urge the United\nNations to support the decisions taken at that regional\nsummit and thus to follow the lead of the African\nUnion, which has already responded favourably to that\nappeal. I also take this opportunity to thank the heads\nof State of the subregion and the mediators for the\nsupport that they have constantly provided to the\nBurundian peace process.\nAs everyone knows, security concerns are\nunfortunately not limited to within my country\u2019s\nborders. The security of Burundi affects that of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and\nTanzania. In the light of that interdependence, an\ninternational conference on peace, security, democracy,\neconomic development and regional integration in the\nGreat Lakes region is scheduled for November in\nDar es Salaam. That conference will undoubtedly have\na positive effect on the countries concerned. I have the\nfirm conviction that it will promote a new dynamic of\npeace in the entire subregion so that we can bury the\nhatchet of war and turn resolutely towards the integral\nand integrated development of our peoples.\nThe efforts to contain and resolve the many\nconflicts that continue to shake the African continent\nare very instructive. First of all, the African countries\nand the African Union have shown their political will\nand their resolve to manage their own problems,\ndespite an obvious shortage of resources. Therefore, it\nis time to call for the substantial strengthening of\ninternational support provided to the African Union\nand for much more active cooperation between the\nAfrican Union and the United Nations on conflict\nprevention and the restoration of peace. Moreover, the\nvarious approaches have shown us that the quest for\npeace must be inclusive, not deliberately excluding\nanyone. That is a sensible and productive approach.\nSuch joint action is something we hope the\nOrganization can do \u2014 particularly now, when\nmultilateralism seems to be recovering from recent\ndifficult ordeals. We must therefore remain united to\npreserve the cherished ideals bequeathed to us by the\nfounders of the United Nations and enthusiastically\nreaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration.\nA much more cohesive and shared action under\nthe banner of the United Nations is thus essential at the\npresent time, marked by the complexity of the\nchallenges we are called to face, such as nebulous\ninternational terrorism, which is more of a threat to\npeace, stability and the safety of our borders than ever\nbefore; the risk of the proliferation of small arms and\nlight weapons; and prostitution and the illicit trade in\nhuman persons, whose effects are both cruel and\ndevastating to human rights, particularly children\u2019s\nrights.\nCohesion undoubtedly implies a carefully\nplanned effort. In that regard, we welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative to establish a High-Level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Its\nconclusions will serve as beacons to us as we seek to\nhumanize international relations and to promote a\nworld of solidarity and development compatible with\nthe environment.\nThe complexity of the current challenges\njustifies \u2014 now more than ever before \u2014 the urgent,\nlong-awaited reform of the Organization. We welcome\nthe steps already taken to streamline the working\nmethods of the General Assembly and the reforms\nalready initiated within the Secretariat with a view to\nadapting the Organization\u2019s internal structures and\nculture to new expectations and challenges. We hope\nthat the same dynamic will be applied to Security\nCouncil reform so that it will soon become a reality.\n8\n\nAttaining the Millennium Development Goals is a\nchallenge for us all. Experts suggest that the efforts\nalready undertaken are not equal to the task. Therefore,\nwe must sharpen our focus by mobilizing more of the\nnecessary resources.\nOur moral and historic responsibility to future\ngenerations is particularly great in the fight against\nHIV/AIDS. Entire families have been decimated,\nmillions of children have been orphaned and elderly\npersons are abandoned, alone and defenceless. It is the\nfamily structure that is disintegrating, and that is\nhorrible to see. It is our common responsibility to unite\nour forces to wipe out this pandemic, which knows no\nborders and threatens the very survival of the human\nrace. We have no right to fail.\nIn the economic area, we know the unbearable\nsituation of the peoples in the least developed\ncountries, who are trapped in abject poverty. In that\nregard, my delegation urges the international\ncommunity to work together in implementing the\nBrussels Programme of Action. From that perspective,\ndebt relief, more flexible conditions for joining the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, an increase\nin official development assistance and the opening up\nof international markets deserve careful attention.\nThe international community cannot remain\nindecisive on the issue of agricultural subsidies in\nindustrialized countries that distort the rules of the\ngame of free competition and considerably reduce the\nopportunities for poor countries to develop.\nAfrica has enormous natural resources, yet\npoverty, diseases and suffering of every kind ravage it\nmore than they do other continents. By forming the\nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development, Africans\nhave committed themselves to promoting good\npolitical and economic governance \u2014 a prerequisite\nfor sustainable development. The priorities are already\nidentified, sector by sector, and the subregional\nstructures are being further strengthened. Yet the\nsuccess of the efforts currently under way will depend\nnot only on the resolve of Africans themselves, but\nalso on the level of solidarity offered by the\ninternational community.\nThe twentieth century and the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century have witnessed important forums\nin which the world\u2019s leaders have made decisive\ncommitments in various areas affecting human\nsecurity, in the profound sense of the term. Those\ncommitments, which have given rise to much hope\nthroughout the world, have been implemented only\npartially. It is our hope that the high-level plenary\nmeeting scheduled for 2005 will be able to breathe new\nlife into the implementation of the commitments made,\nfor the happiness and prosperity of present and future\ngenerations."

        "file_text": "At the outset,\nallow me, on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, to\nwarmly congratulate you, Sir, an eminent son of Gabon\nand of Africa, with which Viet Nam has always\nenjoyed warm sentiments and brotherly relations, on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session. I am confident that, under your\nable guidance, this session will be crowned with fine\nsuccess. I also take this opportunity to express our high\n29\n\nappreciation for the tremendous efforts and\ncontributions made by the previous President,\nMr. Julian Hunte, to the work of the fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nAs the fifth year of the twenty-first century\napproaches, we all cannot help asking ourselves\nwhether the world is a safer, fairer or \u2014 in a more\ncomprehensive assessment \u2014 better place for our\npeoples to live in. With all that has happened over the\nlast year, unfortunately, the answer cannot be\naffirmative.\nThe recent barbaric and inhuman massacre of\nhostages at the school in Beslan, Russia, its scale and\nthe manner in which it was committed show that\nterrorism has become more brutal than ever and that it\nis spreading to almost every corner of the world and\nsparing no nation. At this forum, we wish to reaffirm\nthe position of the Vietnamese Government denouncing\nevery act of terrorism. We urge the international\ncommunity to further strengthen cooperation with a\nview to eliminating terrorism from our civilized world.\nWe have more than once stated our fundamental\nposition that, if it is to enjoy broad support and\nparticipation and therefore be effective, the fight\nagainst terrorism must be pursued in conformity with\nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter and free\nfrom selectivity and double standards.\nA serious review would reveal that this is not a\nsituation we can claim to have today. For a second time\nin two years, last April, in pursuit of their secessionist\naim of creating a so-called independent State of Degar,\nKok Ksor and the organization he created, the\nMontagnard Foundation, staged a violent terrorist riot\nin the central highlands of Viet Nam, seriously\nthreatening the security and territorial integrity of our\ncountry. And still today, they continue to enjoy\nunjustified protection by certain forces.\nWhile encouraged by the trend of enhanced\ncooperation and friendship among countries and\nregions, we are equally concerned about conflicts and\nother threats mounting in different areas, especially in\nthe Middle East and Africa. The Iraqi people are yet to\nknow genuine peace. Non-traditional security threats,\nsuch as narcotics, the spread of diseases, transnational\norganized crime and environmental degradation,\ncontinue to affect adversely the life of peoples and the\ndevelopment of nations.\nThe year 2005 is approaching. We are to review\nthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals.\nAn undeniable fact is that the window of opportunity\nfor the economic development and integration of\ndeveloping countries has become narrower, while the\ngap between the rich countries and the poor countries\nand that between the rich and the poor within countries\nare increasingly wider. According to a recent report by\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment, the gap between the world\u2019s richest and\npoorest countries at present is 74-fold. That being the\nreality, what is discouraging is that the proportion of\nresources being utilized for economic development is\nnegatively imbalanced. Last year, for example, military\nexpenditures by rich countries amounted to more than\n$700 billion, which was 10 times higher than the total\namount of their official development assistance for\ndeveloping nations.\nInstead of receiving a stronger commitment to\ndevelopment assistance, developing countries have\nfallen victim to unfair practices in international trade.\nA case in point is the application of protectionist\nmeasures under the form of anti-dumping duties\nimposed on Viet Nam\u2019s catfish and shrimp, as well as\nsimilar products of other developing countries. The\nunfair imposition of anti-dumping duties on Viet\nNam\u2019s shrimp export by the United States has inflicted\nlosses on 3.5 million poor Vietnamese farmers who\nearn their living directly or indirectly from the shrimp\nindustry. That not only runs counter to the principles of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), but also\nundermines the poverty-reduction efforts of the\nVietnamese Government, as well as the results of\ntechnical assistance provided by such international\nbodies as the World Bank, the International Monetary\nFund, the Asian Development Bank and various United\nNations agencies.\nIn a world where injustice and uncertainties\nremain, it is both a desire of all nations and a primary\ntask of the international community to build a more\npeaceful and fairer environment conducive to\ndevelopment and prosperity. Such an environment can\nbe created only if all nations strictly comply with the\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter\nand international law, of which respect for the national\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of nations are\nmost important. As the world\u2019s largest multilateral\n30\n\nOrganization, the United Nation is the sole entity fully\ncapable of creating that new environment.\nViet Nam holds that, to fulfil that crucial role, the\nUnited Nations should be reformed in a way that will\nimprove its effectiveness and democracy. We highly\nappreciate the ongoing efforts of the High-Level Panel\non Threats, Challenges and Change and hope that the\nPanel will be able to put forth recommendations that\ncan serve as a good basis for member States to hold in-\ndepth discussions with a view to arriving at concrete\nmeasures to be implemented soon, thus meeting the\nexpectations of the world public at large of a new,\neffective and more democratic United Nations.\nIn that connection, Viet Nam is of the view that,\nif the Security Council\u2019s democracy, effectiveness and\ntransparency are to be enhanced and if it is to truly act\non behalf of all United Nations Members, as stated in\nthe Charter, both the non-permanent and the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council should be enlarged\nand developing countries more adequately represented\nin that important body. We wish to reiterate our support\nfor Japan, Germany, India and other capable countries\nfrom different continents becoming permanent\nmembers of the Security Council once it is enlarged.\nA more peaceful, fairer and more favourable\nenvironment for development requires international\neconomic relations based on equality, mutual benefits,\nshared responsibilities and the realization of\ncommitments. Developed countries should seriously\nseek to fulfil their commitments to allocating 0.7 per\ncent of their gross domestic product to official\ndevelopment assistance; provide broader, faster and\ndeeper debt relief to poor nations; finance development\nprojects; and create fairer and more favourable\nconditions for developing nations to access the world\nmarket and to join the WTO.\nViet Nam holds that regional and interregional\ncooperation and new partnerships between developed\nand developing countries are effective measures for\nputting into place fair and favourable conditions for\ndevelopment and for making sure that all nations will\nbenefit from the current process of globalization. We\nwelcome the initiative on a new strategic partnership\nbetween Asia and Africa that is being discussed among\ncountries of the two continents. The initiative, the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, is highly\ncommendable. Viet Nam attaches great importance to\npromoting South-South cooperation, especially with\nAfrican countries, as manifested in the \u201ctwo plus one\u201d\nformula, in which Viet Nam and an African country,\nwith the participation of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations, cooperate in\nagricultural development. With a view to increasing\ncooperation with and assistance to developing nations,\nwe call for an end to unjust embargoes, especially the\nunilateral embargo against Cuba, which has been in\nplace for years now and caused untold difficulties and\nsuffering for the Cuban people.\nIt is Viet Nam\u2019s consistent policy to support the\njust cause of the Palestinian people in the struggle for\ntheir inalienable rights. We call on the parties\nconcerned to refrain from and cease acts of violence\nand actively to participate in the implementation of the\nroad map for peace towards a just and lasting solution\nthat takes into account the interests of the parties\nconcerned for the sake of peace and stability in the\nMiddle East.\nRestoring peace and security and reconstructing\nIraq are pressing needs of the people of that country at\npresent. Viet Nam is concerned about the escalating\nviolence against innocent civilians. We hope that the\nsituation in Iraq will soon be stabilized so that the Iraqi\npeople can focus on their national reconstruction and\ndevelopment.\nThe United Nations should play a more active\nrole in Iraq, commensurate with its mandate. Viet Nam\nattended the conference on the reconstruction of Iraq\nand is willing to involve itself more actively in that\nprocess.\nIn our national reform and development process\nover the past 18 years, we have surmounted enormous\nchallenges to realize the goal of a rich people, a strong\ncountry, a just, democratic and civilized society.\nEncouraging results have been recorded. Over the past\n10 years, the average annual growth of our gross\ndomestic product has been maintained at as high as 7.4\nper cent, with the number of poor households reduced\nby half. Special importance has been given to people-\ncentred development. We are resolved to sustain high\neconomic growth in combination with the development\nof culture, the advancement of social progress and\nequality, the improvement of living conditions for the\npeople and, most important, the achievement of the\ngoal of becoming an industrialized country by 2020.\nGiven our substantial initial achievements and the\nappropriate path on which we have embarked, the\n31\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme, in its third\nreport on the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals in Viet Nam in 2003, assessed that\nViet Nam is capable of overcoming its challenges to\nreach the Goals set in the Millennium Declaration. We\nwish to take this opportunity to express our deep\ngratitude to the United Nations agencies for their\neffective assistance. The United Nations agencies in\nViet Nam have taken important steps to further\nenhance cooperation effectiveness, especially those\nwithin the United Nations Development Assistance\nFramework. We are committed to continuing to work\nwith them in striving for the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nIn its reform process, Viet Nam pursues a foreign\npolicy of openness, independence, sovereignty and the\ndiversification and multilateralization of relations, and\nis willing to be a friend to and reliable partner of all\ncountries striving for independence, peace,\ndevelopment and cooperation. Increasing regional and\ninterregional cooperation is a consistent policy and an\ninseparable component of the Vietnamese\nGovernment\u2019s policy towards greater international\nintegration. Viet Nam is actively participating in\neconomic cooperation activities within the frameworks\nof the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the\nAsia-Pacific Conference on Electron Microscopy and\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN).\nWithin ASEAN, Viet Nam works closely with\nother ASEAN countries to promote regional\ncooperation through such initiatives as the creation of\nthe ASEAN security community, the ASEAN economic\ncommunity and the ASEAN socio-cultural community,\nthe Initiative for ASEAN Integration, the initiative on\nsub-Mekong regional cooperation, and development\ntriangles. ASEAN attaches great importance to\npromoting its relationship with dialogue partners.\nActive steps are being taken to establish free-trade\nareas between ASEAN and China, Japan and the\nRepublic of Korea, and to promote closer economic\npartnership with the United States, the European\nUnion, Russia and India, including free-trade areas.\nViet Nam believes that multifaceted cooperation in\nSouth-East Asia will make important contributions to\nbuilding a peaceful, fair and favourable environment\nfor regional countries.\nAs evidence of its determination to participate\nmore actively in international and interregional\ncooperation frameworks, Viet Nam is going to host the\nFifth Asia-Europe Summit in Hanoi this October and\nthe APEC Summit in 2006. We are standing for\nelection to a non-permanent seat in the Security\nCouncil for the term 2008-2009. In undertaking those\nimportant efforts, we look forward to enjoying the\ncontinued support and cooperation of the international\ncommunity.\nOur global village longs for a more peaceful,\nstable and favourable environment for development\nand shared prosperity. Striving together, we will turn\nthat dream into reality."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to\nexpress to you, Sir, our warm felicitations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session. We congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte\non his successful stewardship of the fifty-eighth\nsession of the Assembly. I also reaffirm our deep\nappreciation for the wise leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his services for the cause\nof peace and progress in the world.\nA profound transformation is under way in\ninternational relations. The dangerous balances of the\ncold war have been replaced by the complex and\nequally dangerous realities of our world today. It is a\nworld marked by intensifying globalization of\neconomies, production, trade and information, on one\nside; and by terrorist violence, poverty and disease, on\nthe other.\nThe growing asymmetries in power among States,\ndiscrimination in the dispensing of international\njustice, repression of peoples\u00ed legitimate aspirations\nand growing socio-economic disparities have\nprecipitated new threats to international peace and to\ninternational security: the threats of terrorism,\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and\nimploding States. The world today sees turmoil and\nupheaval everywhere, especially in the third world, and\nmore specifically in the Muslim world. Too many\nfronts have been opened and too many battle lines have\nbeen drawn. The time for closing fronts has come. The\nworld today is crying for peace, reconciliation and\nreform. Our objective today has to be harmony through\nreconciliation and accommodation, globally and\nregionally.\nTerrorism poses the most urgent threat to many\ncountries, including the most powerful States. For\nmany of us, the terrorist threat is very close and may be\nvery personal. Terrorism threatens Pakistan's vital\nnational interests and objectives. We have thus\nparticipated actively in the unprecedented global\ncampaign against it. Pakistan has led the way in that\ncampaign. Our counter-terrorist campaign is ongoing.\nGlobal cooperation against terrorism has been\nhighly successful. Determined and collective action has\ncontained and disrupted the violent agendas of the\nterrorists. We are winning the battle against terrorists.\nHowever, what we are doing is insufficient to win the\nultimate war against them. The immediate anti-terrorist\nresponse has to be accompanied by a clear long-term\nstrategy that strikes at the root of the problem if we are\nto ensure final success against this scourge.\nI have proposed a two-pronged strategy of\nenlightened moderation to overcome terrorism and\nprevent a clash of civilizations. The most recent\nIslamic Summit, in Malaysia, endorsed that plan,\nwhich involves, on the one hand, internal socio-\neconomic reform in the Muslim world and, on the\nother, active support from the major Powers to ensure\npolitical justice and socio-economic revival for all\nIslamic peoples. While the Islamic world has taken its\nfirst step in the form of nominating a Commission of\nEminent Persons to propose measures for a renaissance\nin the Muslim world, the major Powers of the West\nhave yet to show movement in seriously trying to\nresolve internationally recognized disputes affecting\nthe Muslim world.\nThe industrialized world must support the\nendeavour to bring about an Islamic renaissance,\nespecially through adequate financial and technical\nassistance and larger trade opportunities. More\nimportant, justice must be offered to Islamic peoples in\nthe form of the resolution of all outstanding\ninternational disputes which affect Muslims. There is\nno time to lose. Action has to be taken before an iron\n21\n\ncurtain finally descends between the West and the\nIslamic world.\nThe tragedy of Palestine is an open wound\ninflicted on the psyche of every Muslim. It generates\nanger and resentment across the Islamic world.\nContinued Israeli violence and the Israelis' erection of\nthe illegal separation wall, usurping more Palestinian\nland, as well as suicide attacks by misguided\nPalestinians, are frustrating the prospects of peace and\nprolonging the agony of the Palestinian people. While\nPakistan stands for peace, recognizing the right of\nIsrael to exist as also the right of the Palestinians to\nhave their own homeland, we can never accept the\nusurpation of additional Palestinian land. Israel has no\nright to erect its separation wall beyond its 1967\nboundaries. Pakistan calls on Israel to withdraw the\nwall from all occupied Palestinian lands, taking it back\nto the pre-1967 boundaries. We also call on Israel to\nstop the daily atrocities against Palestinians. Pakistan\nalso appeals to President Yasser Arafat to use his\ninfluence to reciprocally halt the intifada and give\npeace a chance.\nA major responsibility rests with the Quartet, and\nin particular with the world's greatest Power, the\nUnited States, to secure a fair and peaceful solution to\nthe problem, realizing the vision of two States, Israel\nand Palestine, living side by side in peace, harmony\nand security. The United States can and must play the\nrole of a just broker of peace. Peace must succeed in\nthe Middle East; failure is no longer an option.\nIt has always been my conviction that Pakistan\nand India can resolve all their differences, including\nover Jammu and Kashmir, through a sincere dialogue.\nThe dangerous confrontation of 2002 and the three\nwars prior to that between our two countries have\ndemonstrated that there is no military solution to our\nproblems. The aspiration to peace enjoys popular\nsupport in Pakistan and, I believe, in India as well.\nNeither country can achieve its ambition for social and\neconomic progress in the absence of peace. We must\nachieve peace for the sake of the impoverished people\nof South Asia \u00f3 for their development and prosperity.\nAfter several aborted attempts, Pakistan and India\nhave been able to initiate confidence-building\nmeasures and a composite dialogue this year to address\nall outstanding issues. Pakistan has pursued this\nprocess with complete sincerity, giving bilateralism a\nfinal chance. We feel that the dual channels of\nconfidence-building measures and the dialogue process\nmust proceed in tandem. We also are firmly committed\nto resolving all disputes with India peacefully,\nincluding the Kashmir dispute. That issue cannot be\nignored. Its resolution cannot be delayed inordinately.\nWe desire a resolution for Kashmir which is just and\nacceptable to India, Pakistan and the people of\nKashmir.\nWe also seek strategic stability with India. I am\nglad to say that up until now, the normalization process\nhas progressed well, in a cordial atmosphere. Now that\nthe negotiations are entering the difficult stage of\ngrappling with solutions to previously irreconcilable\ndisputes, Pakistan hopes that India will show the same\nsincerity, flexibility and boldness that Pakistan will\ndemonstrate. I look forward to my meeting the day\nafter tomorrow with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\nI would like to convey to him that this is the moment\nfor peace; we must not allow it to slip away.\nIraq has taken a serious turn, to the anguish of the\nentire world community. It is imperative that together\nwith closing the Palestine and Kashmir fronts, we also\nwind down the Iraq confrontation. Pakistan stands for\nrestoration of peace and stability in Iraq to ensure its\nunity and territorial integrity. That can only be\nachieved through handing over governance authority to\nthe people of Iraq and allowing them full control over\ntheir natural resources. Internal law and order and\nsecurity can be best promoted by local Iraqi police and\nmilitia, who need to be built up expeditiously.\nAt an opportune time, and at the request of the\npeople and Government of Iraq, the Muslim world\ncould play a role in bringing peace and harmony to this\nconflict-torn nation.\nThe forthcoming elections in Afghanistan will be\nan important landmark in the country\u00eds progress\ntowards democracy and stability. Pakistan will do all it\ncan to prevent terrorists from using our territory to\ndisrupt the Afghan election process. The subsequent\nparliamentary elections in April 2005 would also augur\nwell for self-governance in Afghanistan. While the\npolitical channel is progressing well \u00f3 and we wish\nPresident Karzai all success \u00f3 the process of building\nthe Afghan National Army and reconstruction efforts\nneed to be accelerated in order to install durable peace\nin Afghanistan.\nIn our globalized world, peace and development\nare interdependent, now more than ever before. Despite\n22\n\ndynamic growth in some parts of the developing world,\neconomic and social disparities are increasing. The rich\nare richer; the poor are poorer. Over 2 billion people on\nour planet \u00f3 a quarter of the world\u00eds population \u00f3\nlive in abject poverty, afflicted by hunger, disease and\nconflict. Islands of peace and prosperity cannot coexist\nfor long within oceans of instability and poverty.\nA bold and innovative global strategy is required\nto redress the growing inequalities in the world. Good\ngovernance is a precondition for development; but the\nneed to rectify the glaring inequities and imbalances in\nthe international financial and trade systems is equally\nessential.\nOfficial development assistance can and must be\ndoubled. Innovative ways can and must be adopted to\ngenerate the financial resources required for\ndevelopment. The billions transferred abroad by\ncorrupt leaders should be returned to the looted\ncountries to finance poverty alleviation, education and\nhealth. International investment flows should be\nconsciously directed to the poorer developing\ncountries, where such funds could unleash the latent\npower of the poor for consumption and production.\nWe also know by now that trade, and not just aid,\nis the way to promote growth and to benefit from\nglobalization. However, it has to be made more\nequitable. Unfair agricultural subsidies should be\neliminated and high and escalating tariffs that\ndiscriminate against the products of the poor should be\nremoved. Special and differential treatment should be\noffered to disadvantaged developing countries. In my\nview, we need more than a level playing field; we need\na field tilted in favour of the developing countries.\nUnless the world\u00eds leaders generate the political\nwill required to agree and implement those measures\nurgently, the Millennium Development Goals will\nremain a mirage.\nIn Pakistan, we are well on the way to\ntransforming our country into a modern, progressive,\ntolerant, democratic, Islamic state, reflecting the vision\nof our founding father, Quaid-e-Azam. Democracy has\nbeen restored in Pakistan. The people have been\nempowered through a revolutionary local government\nsystem. Our women have been empowered. However,\nlike other developing countries, Pakistan confronts\nseveral challenges. But, we are confident of success.\nOur governance is good. Our national priorities are\nabsolutely clear.\nToday, there is welcome resurgence of support for\nmultilateralism. This must be a multilateralism based\non the principles of the United Nations Charter, a\ncooperative and democratic multilateralism. It must\nseek just, peaceful and durable solutions to conflicts\nand disputes. It must promote a programme for nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. It must foster\nglobal development and global prosperity.\nAll our collective aspirations can best be pursued\nwithin this world Organization. The United Nations\nmust be strengthened and revitalized to respond to the\nchallenges of twenty-first century.\nThe United Nations Security Council should\nbecome more effective, democratic and representative.\nThere is no agreement on the aspiration of a few States\nto acquire permanent membership in the Security\nCouncil. The overwhelming majority of States are\nagainst the creation of new centres of privilege. The\nCouncil should be enlarged to ensure the representation\nof the mostly small and medium States which have\njoined the United Nations over the last three decades.\nWe have to consider new ideas to craft a consensus on\nthe enlargement of the Security Council.\nPakistan believes that a new consensus on peace,\nsecurity and development, can and should be achieved\non the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations next year. The summit meeting\nsuggested by the Secretary-General for next year must\nlead to a negotiated final document adopted through\nconsensus. That historic summit will, I hope, and\nPakistan hopes, create a new paradigm to achieve\nuniversal peace and prosperity."

        "file_text": "Allow me\nat the outset warmly to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session and to assure you and the other\nmembers of the Bureau, whom I also congratulate, of\nthe full support of the delegation of Mali as you carry\nout your mission.\nI also wish to pay tribute to the dedication of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and to thank him for his\ntireless efforts in the service of the United Nations.\nSix days ago, Mali commemorated in its own way\nthe forty-fourth anniversary of its independence. From\nthis high rostrum, the most symbolic of all, I wish to\nrecall the efforts of my country to build, under the\nleadership of Mr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, President of\nthe Republic and Head of State, a democratic, stable\nand prosperous Mali asserting its place in the concert\nof nations.\nFor several weeks now, our country and others of\nthe North and West African regions, have been stricken\nby an unprecedented locust infestation. As President\nAmadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 stressed in his message to the\nnation on 22 September, the magnitude and speed of\nthe infestation have surpassed the most pessimistic\nprojections. The catastrophic effects of that insect\nplague on the upcoming harvest and on our vegetation\nare a true threat to the livelihood of the millions of men\nand women thus exposed to famine.\nThe Government of the Republic of Mali is\nactively working to suppress the scourge, above all\nthrough a national mobilization that has brought teams,\nbrigades and village communities to work in the field,\nand with the support of the international community,\nand in particular to brotherly African countries. I\nreiterate here my country\u2019s gratitude to them all. I also\nwish firmly to say, however, that, faced with the insect\nplague and in order to ensure the food security of\ninfested countries, including Mali, we have a shared\nresponsibility to launch and strengthen short-, medium-\n16\n\nand long-term international mobilization. We must act,\nact quickly and act effectively.\nQuestions related to international peace and\nsecurity continue to be a source of concern to us. In the\npast year we have seen crises and conflicts multiply\nthroughout the world. I would like, in particular, to\nrecall the situation in West Africa and Mali\u2019s initiatives\nto contribute to the settlement of the crisis in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, whose subregional repercussions are\nconsiderable and fraught with consequences for peace\nand stability in West Africa.\nIn this regard, the so-called Bamako II meeting\nmade it possible to establish the conditions for the\nsuccess of the Accra III high-level meeting. I\nforcefully echo the assertion of President Amadou\nToumani Tour\u00e9 that Mali will continue to support\npeace and reconciliation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire: peace for the\npeople of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and peace for all of the\nforeigners who live in that brotherly neighbouring\ncountry.\nHere I would mention Mali\u2019s participation in the\npeacekeeping missions of the United Nations, the\nAfrican Union and the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in Liberia, Sierra Leone, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Haiti.\nFurthermore, Mali\u2019s commitment to international\npeace and security is at the root of our country\u2019s action\nto make the Sahelo-Saharan area a focal point of\ndevelopment and stability. This was especially evident\nduring the Malian presidency of the Community of\nSahelo-Saharan States.\nMali is also deeply concerned by the situation in\nthe Middle East: measures to close off Palestinian\nterritories, arbitrary arrests, extrajudiciary executions,\nthe destruction of property, land seizures, lack of\nrespect for resolutions adopted by the international\ncommunity and the siege imposed upon President\nArafat. Those actions do not help to establish true\npeace in that part of the world. Mali, which has always\nsupported the just cause of the Palestinian people,\nurgently appeals to the members of the Quartet to\nrestore dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian\nAuthority, with a view to a just, equitable and lasting\nsettlement of a conflict which has gone on too long.\nInternational terrorism is today another challenge\nto international peace and security. We have seen this\nphenomenon on all continents, making it abundantly\nclear that terrorism has neither homeland nor religion.\nThat is why the international community must display\nsteadfast political will in combating terrorism by, inter\nalia, strengthening the available legal arsenal,\nincluding mechanisms for cooperation and technical\nassistance. Beyond this, we must tackle the root causes\nof the phenomenon, which include poverty, massive\nhuman rights violations, intolerance, injustice and\nimpunity from prosecution.\nThe question of small arms and light weapons is\nalso a primary concern for us. Mali has made a\nsignificant contribution in this area by developing\ninitiatives at the subregional, regional and international\nlevels. In this regard, Mali is striving to transform the\nECOWAS Moratorium on the Importation, Exportation\nand Manufacture of Small Arms and Light Weapons in\nWest Africa into a convention. We further believe that\nthe international community must now resolutely\nengage in the establishment of a binding legal\ninstrument on marking, registering and tracing small\narms and light weapons.\nThe situation of children in armed conflicts is\nalso a source of concern for my country. We fully\nsupport the recommendations contained in the report of\nthe Special Representative to the Secretary-General for\nChildren and Armed Conflict (E/CN.4/2004/70), and\ncall for the effective implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1539 (2004). Along the same lines,\nMali is working within the Human Security Network to\nkeep this question among the priorities of our\nOrganization.\nIn order to effectively prevent and manage these\nsituations of crisis and conflict \u2014 that is, to preserve\nand guarantee international peace and security \u2014 the\ninternational community must work for an international\norder that is based on the rule of law, and for a United\nNations whose legitimacy is strengthened. Thus, we\nwelcome the establishment of the High-Level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change, and we anxiously\nawait its conclusions.\nThe question of development is, and must remain,\na priority issue on the international agenda, and thus\nwe welcome the decision to hold a plenary meeting in\n2005 devoted to follow-up of the outcome of the\nMillennium Summit, and to a comprehensive and\ncoordinated follow-up and implementation of\ndocuments from the major conferences and summit\nmeetings organized by the United Nations on economic\n17\n\nand social topics. We hope that that meeting will\nenable us to conduct an objective and candid review of\nthe way in which commitments have been met,\nincluding the progress achieved and obstacles\nremaining in the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nDefeating poverty is a major objective for the\nGovernment of the Republic of Mali. As part of that\nendeavour, the adoption in 2002, and the\nimplementation, of a strategic framework, has made it\npossible to achieve important results in the areas of\neducation, health, rural development and basic\ninfrastructure. I take this opportunity to express Mali\u2019s\nsupport for the initiative launched by Presidents\nJacques Chirac and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, which\nled to the New York Declaration on Action Against\nHunger and Poverty adopted on 20 September 2004.\nOn trade negotiations, Mali attaches great\nimportance to the round of trade negotiations under\nway within the World Trade Organization (WTO): the\nDoha development round. We hope that those\nnegotiations will lead to an economic system which\nwill enable all countries, especially developing\ncountries, to fully maximize their potential. We hope to\nsee a true breakthrough in agricultural negotiations,\nwhich should lead to the elimination of subsidies and\nother production and export support mechanisms,\nparticularly with respect to cotton. Indeed, cotton is\none of the commodities where we, African producer\ncountries, offer true comparative advantages, since\nproduction costs are one fifth those in developed\ncountries. At present, however, our countries are\nseriously harmed by production and export subsidies\nfor cotton.\nFor that reason, we reaffirm our opposition to\nsubsidy policies which undermine free market\ncompetition, lead to overproduction and lower prices\non the international market and prevent our agriculture\nfrom getting off the ground.\nThat is why Mali is also calling for the gradual\nelimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers, as well\nas the implementation of measures on the free\nmovement of people, goods and services. We are\npleased with the European Union\u2019s commitment to\nfacilitate the integration of least developed countries\nwithin the multilateral trading system, including\nthrough the adoption in April 2004 of an action plan\nfor agriculture that includes a proposal for an Africa-\nEurope partnership on cotton.\nThe AIDS pandemic is progressing at such an\nalarming rate that, in addition to its health\nrepercussions, it has today become a problem for\neconomic and social development, especially in Africa.\nThat is why we must implement, urgently and in full,\nthe commitments that we undertook in 2001 so that we\ncan mobilize the necessary energy and resources to\neffectively fight the scourge. Mali has set up a\nmultisectoral programme to fight HIV/AIDS at a cost\nof $150 million, or 73 billion CFA francs. The\nimplementation of that programme will make it\npossible to distribute antiretroviral drugs to patients\nfree of charge, as well as to provide necessary impetus\nto the information and awareness campaign with a\nview to prevention. Pilot laboratories for screening and\ncounselling will be established throughout the country,\nand small and medium-sized businesses for social\noutreach will be set up, thus providing jobs for young\npeople.\nWith regard to the situation of people with\ndisabilities, Mali is pleased with the negotiations that\nare under way with a view to elaborating a convention\nto protect their rights and dignity. We are convinced\nthat the adoption of such an instrument would establish\na framework for improved social and economic\nintegration for people with disabilities, allowing them\nto fully participate in the development efforts of their\nrespective societies.\nI would like to conclude in the same vein as I\nbegan \u2014 by emphatically reaffirming the faith that\nMali has in the United Nations, whose purposes and\nprinciples, set out almost 60 years ago, remain deeply\nmeaningful and highly relevant. It is true that recently\nthe Organization\u2019s capacity and credibility have been\nseriously undermined. It is therefore all the more\nimportant that we carry out a thorough reform of the\nOrganization and revitalize its main bodies. Mali\nwelcomes the important progress that has been\nachieved in the context of the revitalization of the work\nof the General Assembly. The reorganization of the\nwork of the Main Committees, the strengthening of the\nrole of the Bureau and the improvement in working\nmethods will certainly result in the greater\neffectiveness of this important body. I would like to\npay tribute, Sir, to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte,\nfor the remarkable work that he accomplished in that\nrespect.\n18\n\nMali shares the common African position that\nSecurity Council reform is a necessary \u2014 indeed, a\npriority \u2014 task if we are to strengthen the capacities\nand the credibility of that important body. The Council\nmust be more representative and legitimate. Its\ncomposition should reflect the realities of today\u2019s\nworld and be expanded in both categories of\nmembership, with particular account being taken of the\nrepresentation of Africa.\nThe people of the world have placed their hope in\nthe United Nations, and they expect, in return, greater\npeace, security, democracy, development and solidarity.\nAs the community of nations, we have the means to\nachieve those goals, thanks to our collective awareness\nand the safeguarding of the values we all share:\ndemocracy, respect for the rule of law, the primacy of\nhuman rights, the preservation of the environment and\nthe protection of future generations from the scourge of\nwar."

        "file_text": "I would\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection. We are pleased that a man of your ability, a\nFrancophone representative of a friendly country, is\ndirecting our proceedings.\nI also wish to warmly applaud our Secretary-\nGeneral. We have heard his message on respect for the\nrule of law. And through the Secretary-General, I wish to\ncommend the entire staff of this institution, here and\neverywhere in the world: their courage and commitment\nare a credit to our ideals and to the organizations they\nserve \u2014 sadly, sometimes at the cost of their own\nlives.\nHow are we to meet the challenges facing the\nworld? That is the question we all keep asking\nourselves, one after another, from this rostrum. And\nhow are we to meet the world\u2019s expectations unless we\nall mobilize? More than ever, the United Nations\nremains the one irreplaceable, legitimate framework\nfor harnessing that mobilization and translating it into\ncollective action.\nWe have much to do: conflicts remain unresolved,\nwhile others are breaking out; poverty is declining all too\nslowly; people are destroyed by wars; refugees are torn\nfrom their land; and the threat of terrorism is not\nfading. Yes, we have much to do. Yes, we have a duty\nto act, and an obligation never to give up.\nThe United Nations is acting \u2014 on all fronts, on\nthe front line. To resolve conflicts and prevent them\nfrom flaring up again, it is present everywhere, on all\ncontinents, in Haiti, Kosovo, the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Afghanistan and many\nother fronts, deploying over 50,000 Blue Helmets. It\nprovides assistance to 17 million people protected by\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees. Through the\nWorld Food Programme, it feeds more than 100 million\nindividuals. And it helps, especially through the United\nNations Development Programme, 170 States or\nterritories to develop.\nUnited Nations activities \u2014 our activities \u2014\ncontinue to expand. Thus, the Organization is called\nupon to be at the centre of the counter-terrorism\nmeasures that the international community is putting in\nplace. The threat of terrorism, now a global one,\ncalling for a global response. That is why France\ncommitted itself here to the fight, and did so again\nrecently by supporting the strengthening of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee.\nThe tragedy of 11 September, which I refer to\nwith feeling here in New York City, was an attack on\nus all. Since then, terrorism has continued to strike: in\nEurope, in Madrid, six months ago; and in Asia, in Bali\nand Jakarta. Cowardly attacks are mounted against the\nweakest. How can we not be appalled at the tragedy of\nthe school in Beslan where children \u2014 the symbol of\ninnocence \u2014 were violently massacred?\nWe are waging a merciless fight against\nterrorism. Let us at the same time address its roots.\nThat means putting an end to situations that terrorists\nexploit; giving the world\u2019s excluded hope again;\nrestoring dignity to those peoples deprived of it; and\nensuring that dialogue and cooperation among\ncivilizations, cultures and religions prevail, rather than\nconflict and intolerance.\nGlobal threats require a strong, and always\ncollective, response. The threat of proliferation, which\n29\n\ncould merge with that of terrorism, calls for resolute\nand sustained action. The non-proliferation regime has\nbeen seriously undermined by the combined action of\ncertain States and non-State actors. That is why\nstrengthening existing instruments is today essential.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) Review Conference in 2005 will be an\nopportunity to do so.\nA safer and freer world is, first, a more just\nworld. That is why we must act relentlessly to resolve\nconflicts. I am, of course, thinking, first and foremost,\nof the Middle East, where \u2014 in the wake of the hopes\nraised by Madrid, Oslo, Camp David and Taba \u2014 the\nabsence of any prospect is today breeding despair,\nextremism and violence of every kind. This central\ncrisis can be resolved only through a negotiated\nsettlement based on international law, enabling all the\npeoples \u2014 I repeat, all the peoples \u2014 of the region to\nlive in dignity and security.\nThe road map, which the parties have accepted\nand which the Security Council has endorsed, must be\nimplemented in full and in good faith. France hopes\nthat the withdrawal from Gaza is a first step in that\ndirection. It will make every effort to get the peace\nprocess under way again. It will continue to act vis-\u00e0-\nvis all the leaders \u2014 the elected and legitimate\nleaders \u2014 of that region.\nLet us make no mistake: building peace in the\nMiddle East is a historic responsibility for our\ngeneration. Europe \u2014 the European Union \u2014 in\npartnership with the United States, Russia and the\nUnited Nations, is determined to play a political role in\norder to stimulate this process.\nIn Iraq, violence is exploding. It seems to us that\nonly when the Iraqis themselves take control of their\nfuture, and when the political process provided for by\nthe Security Council is pursued, will the country be\nable to escape the chaos that is destabilizing the entire\nregion. France, as everyone knows, did not approve of\nthe conditions in which the conflict was unleashed.\nNeither today nor tomorrow will it commit itself\nmilitarily in Iraq. However, it reaffirms its willingness,\nwith its European partners, to assist the Iraqi people in\nrebuilding their country and in restoring their\ninstitutions.\nWho can fail to see that, in the Middle East,\neverything is fragile and everything is interconnected?\nWho can fail to understand that the only path \u2014\neverywhere \u2014 is sovereignty and justice for peoples?\nOnly then will they make progress towards peace and\nthe economic and political modernization to which\nthey are entitled.\nAfrica, too, is where we will win or lose the battle\nfor justice. Without justice, there will be no peace.\nWithout peace, there will be no lasting development. The\nfuture of the African continent, and its stability and\ndevelopment, are a vital objective for us all.\nToday, with the impetus of the United Nations,\nlongstanding crises have been, or will be, settled \u2014\nMozambique, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Others,\nhowever, have broken out, and together we must\nprevent them from worsening or spreading: in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, the Central African Republic, and Darfur. The\nGreat Lakes region is slow to find the path to peace,\njust as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is\nslow to die, and the Somali question remains to be\nresolved.\nOn that great continent, which is undergoing\nprofound change, facing real threats but also\nconsiderable potential, political leaders are today\ndemonstrating a genuine determination to commit to\nworking to resolve conflicts and crises. That can be\nseen from the implementation of the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD); the resolute\ncommitment of the African Union on the political front\nand in the field; and the growing role of regional\norganizations. We resolutely support that commitment.\nFor development, but also for peace-building, we wish\nto bring about the conditions for an effective and\ncoherent partnership between North and South.\nGiven the magnitude of the goals and needs of\nthe continent, I firmly believe in the importance of\npooling the efforts of the Europeans with those of our\nAfrican partners, under United Nations auspices,\nwhenever necessary. I am convinced that our\nexperience of European integration \u2014 without\nattempting to teach any lessons \u2014 can simply be useful\nto that continent, and that is the sense of the statement\nmade on our behalf by the representative of the\npresidency of the European Union, Bernard Bot, before\nthe Assembly the day before yesterday.\nFrance has long been involved in strengthening\nAfrican peacekeeping capacities. Today, the European\nUnion intends to make a commitment immediately and\nwith determination. Operation Artemis, in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, is proof of that\n30\n\ncommitment. The creation of the European Peace\nFacility now provides major support to African\norganizations. We are willing, if the African Union so\nwishes, to assist it in its action for peace, as in the\nSudan.\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nJustice and conflict prevention cannot be\ndissociated from collective action to promote\ndevelopment. The Millennium Goals \u2014 to which the\ndeveloping countries, donor States and multilateral\ninstitutions are committed \u2014 are an overriding obligation\nfor us all, especially the wealthiest countries.\nMore than $50 billion a year is still needed to\nachieve those objectives \u2014 a fact of which we all are\naware. On Monday, 100-odd countries endorsed the\nNew York Declaration on Action Against Hunger and\nPoverty. Together they ask that additional resources be\nprovided for development, including through\ninnovative mechanisms. This is a powerful movement,\nlaunched in this very forum of the United Nations,\naimed at generating the necessary resources for justice\nand for development. It is an important milestone. My\ncountry is proud to have contributed to it, through the\nvoice of the President of the Republic, and it will\ncontinue to do so.\nBut France is also fighting for a more controlled,\nand therefore most just, globalization that would give\neveryone a chance. We advocate the establishment of a\npolitical body, in which the United Nations must have\nits due place \u2014 to improve coordination of multilateral\naction in the economic, social and environmental fields\nand to provide the necessary impetus. This is one of the\nmajor issues that we must consider in coming months,\nespecially on the basis of the proposals that the Panel\non reform is expected to make.\nAgain, a more just world is a world that respects\nhuman dignity and freedom. Fundamental human rights\nare universal. Each man, woman and child has these\ninherent rights, and it is up to us to see that they thrive\nand are respected.\nIt is also up to us to fight firmly and\nuncompromisingly against all manifestations of violence\nand discrimination based on race, origin, gender or\nreligion. Our resolve in the area of human rights, as\nelsewhere, must remain absolute and constant. I mean\nthat we need a genuine dialogue with the civil society\nand with all non-governmental organizations. The time\nhas come, it seems to us, to conclude the negotiation of\na conventional instrument on forced disappearances, to\nrecognize the rights of indigenous peoples and to\nmobilize against all forms of modern slavery.\nLet us not rule out the use of force, in certain\ncases and on the appeal of victims, to prevent massive\nhuman rights violations and acts of violence against\ncivilians. The Security Council has the honour of\nassuming this responsibility, in accordance with the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nLet us also continue putting in place mechanisms\nto combat impunity, often the prerequisite for durable\npeace and lasting reconciliation. The establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court specifically meets this\nobjective. We welcome the major milestone reached\nwith the entry into force of the Rome Statute.\nThe dignity of humankind and peoples also\nrequires due respect for cultures in their diversity. The\nsense of loss of identity contributes to the frustrations\nthat breed a good many conflicts. The unity of the\ninternational community, it goes without saying, cannot\nbe synonymous with uniformity.\nThe negotiation of a convention on cultural\ndiversity, which has just started at the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is,\ntherefore, in our view, a key objective. It must produce\na concrete result, as planned, before the 2005 general\nconference.\nOur planet is dangerous; it is also in danger. The\nearth is showing signs of strain; we are not maintaining\nit; in fact, we are plundering it; the climate is\ndeteriorating. And yet, we should remember, scarcity\nof resources has at all times been a factor in conflict.\nFor the future of our children, we must act while there\nis still time.\nIs there among us, for that matter, one single issue\nthat more obviously ignores borders than ecology and\necological security and requires coordinated action \u2014\nthat is, multilateral action? International governance in\nenvironmental matters is, it seems to us, inadequate\ntoday. We must simplify and strengthen the existing\ninternational regime on environmental issues, develop\nmonitoring, and early warning expertise, and increase\nfinancing, especially for developing countries.\nLet us be clear-sighted. For the environment, as\nfor so many other issues, prevention costs less than\n31\n\ncure. In this regard, we hope the establishment of a\nUnited Nations organization for the environment will\nbe considered, based on the achievements of the United\nNations Environment Programme. We propose that this\ngreat undertaking, which is one of the Millennium Goals,\nbe on the agenda of the September 2005 summit.\nIn a world \u2014 our world \u2014 where 800 million\npeople do not have enough to eat, where more financial\nresources are devoted to weapons than to development,\nwhere millions of men, women and children are forced\nto leave their land to escape destitution or massacres, the\ninternational community has a duty to act and to show\nimagination. It is here at the United Nations where we\ncan meet to take initiatives, to fight misfortune and to\napportion the tasks, all of them urgent.\nThe United Nations system, which is unique and\nmore indispensable than ever, also has an obligation to\nreform itself to meet new needs and new threats, and to\nmake the most of new technologies merely in order to\nlive in our times. The Secretary-General got down to\nthis problem at the start of his first mandate.\nConsiderable work has already been done. The\nproposals of the high-level panel will be the basis for\nthe next, still more ambitious, stages. France has made\nproposals on many issues, such as peacekeeping\noperations, human rights and development financing.\nWe have also indicated, with Germany, how the\nrepresentativity and legitimacy of Security Council\naction might be improved. We advocate enlargement in\nboth categories of members, permanent and non-\npermanent; and we have expressed support for the\naspirations of Germany, Japan, Brazil and India, which\nshould be accompanied by a country from Africa.\nIn a complex and unpredictable world, it is our\njoint responsibility to maintain and strengthen the one\ninstitution where all nations can work together, where\nthey can unite to shape and control their common\ndestiny. Through its legitimacy and ever-increasing\neffectiveness, the United Nations must be the\ninstrument of universal conscience for which it remains\nthe crucible."

        "file_text": "I first addressed the\nGeneral Assembly in the year 2000. The millennium\nyear was a time of great hope, reflected in the outcome\nof the Millennium Summit. World leaders committed\nthe peoples of the planet to a new beginning in which\nthe dawn of the twenty-first century would mark a\nbreak from the past, with a new sharing of burdens,\nand a new common dedication to peace and human\nprogress.\nToday the light of that new dawn is obscured by\nthe dark clouds of war, terror, ethnic violence and\ncontinuing abuse of human rights. Twelve months ago\nand again this week, the Secretary-General pointed out\nthat the Organization is at a fork in the road and that\nwe have to decide on the way forward. Much work has\nbeen undertaken since the Secretary-General laid down\nthat challenge. The High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change is working on its report. I am\npleased to recall that the European Union (EU) made a\ndetailed submission to the Panel, drawn up during\nIreland's recent presidency of the Union. We also took\na decision to mainstream the issue of effective\nmultilateralism in the Union\u00eds discussions with other\nregional groups.\nWe await the Panel's report and the Secretary-\nGeneral\u00eds recommendations that will follow. In his\naddress on Tuesday, the Secretary-General expressed\nthe hope that when the heads of State and Government\nmeet next year to review progress on the Millennium\nDeclaration they will be ready to take bold decisions.\nThey must, because the longer we linger at the fork in\nthe road, the more difficult will be the road ahead.\nWe cannot afford to postpone action. More and\nmore citizens of the world are questioning whether the\nUnited Nations has the capacity, or even the will, to\nprevent conflict and protect the vulnerable from\ninjustice. They are becoming increasingly disillusioned\nwith an Organization which either cannot take\ndecisions or whose decisions are ignored with\nimpunity. They see the politics of the lowest common\ndenominator in operation, with strong and sensible\ndraft resolutions watered down to mere platitudes.\nThey hear the United Nations being denigrated by\nthose who make a virtue of their determination to put\nnational interests above all other considerations. They\nfear that the Organization is no longer driven by the\ndetermination and idealism of the founding fathers.\nMy Prime Minister, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern,\nmade clear last year, when he addressed the General\nAssembly, where the fault lies. It lies with us, the\nGovernments of the Member States. We have a strong\nand much respected Secretary-General in Kofi Annan.\nWe have brave and dedicated officials. Many have put\ntheir lives on the line for the Organization and what it\nstands for. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice. United\nNations staff deserve better protection in the future.\nIt is time for the Governments of Member States\nto act. We need, as the Secretary-General put it, to seek\ncommon solutions to common problems. That will\nrequire political will and effective structures. Neither\none on its own will suffice. The essential requirement\nis a more effective system of collective security. Such a\nsystem requires the unique legitimacy offered by an\neffective United Nations and its Charter.\nIt is clear that the composition of the Security\nCouncil no longer accurately reflects global\ngeopolitical realities. In Ireland\u00eds view, a modest and\nregionally balanced increase in its membership, both in\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories, is\njustified. Increased representation from the developing\nworld would enhance its legitimacy, and thereby its\neffectiveness.\nBut a more effective Security Council will need\nmore than a change in structures. There has to be a\nchange in attitudes. Those States that sit on the Security\nCouncil have a responsibility to rise above national or\nregional interests and act in the wider interests of\nmankind. That is an obligation that rests on each and\nevery member of the Council. But those who either\nassert or aspire to positions of world leadership - and\nthere is no shortage of candidates - bear a particular\nresponsibility to act in the global interest.\nPutting national interests first is not an effective\nanswer to the challenges that confront us. It may be a\nclich\u00c8 to say that our planet is shrinking, but that does\nnot make it any less true. While most of us continue to\nwish to organize and govern ourselves primarily within\nthe framework of the nation-State, we must recognize\nthat technological development and economic\n37\n\nintegration are impairing the effectiveness of the\nnation-State as a defensive bastion.\nPower and influence must be used in the interests\nof the international community as a whole, rather than\nfor the pursuit of narrow, short-term interests. States\nand regions have broad and varied interests, both\nindividual and collective. Our system must\naccommodate and reconcile those interests. Otherwise\nwe are doomed to division between those who would\nimpose hegemony and those who would resist it.\nIn his report on the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration, the Secretary-General has\nwarned that the world is falling short in its\nperformance towards the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals. In sub-Saharan Africa\nespecially, many countries are caught in a poverty trap\nand face the crippling challenges of unsustainable debt\nand HIV/AIDS, often compounded by instability.\nIreland fully recognizes the seriousness of the\nshortfall in development funding that faces us, which is\npresently estimated at \u00c450 billion per year. The best\nmeans of bridging that gap is for donor nations to\nrecommit themselves to reaching the United Nations\ntarget for official development assistance of 0.7 per\ncent of gross national product. The Irish Government\nremains committed to that goal. Ireland, which has\nincreased its official development assistance very\nsubstantially in recent years, will continue working\nactively with its developing country partners to build a\nstrong global partnership for development.\nEconomic and social development is the means\nby which the world\u00eds poorer countries can be lifted out\nof poverty. An open international trading regime aimed\nat facilitating investment is an integral part of our\nmultilateral system, and fair market access is an\nessential part of that. Some developing countries\nestimate that, in a best-case scenario, a successful\noutcome to the Doha Round could help raise up to 500\nmillion people out of extreme poverty. Fairer\ninternational trading arrangements are imperative if we\nare to address the problems of underdevelopment.\nIreland and its European Union partners are determined\nnot to be found wanting in the task of bringing the\nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, finally,\nto a conclusion, with an agreement that meets the\nessential concerns of all sides.\nOver the past year we have once again seen that\nthe failure of State institutions is a major source of\nconflict and human misery. The responsibility for\nprotecting people from conflict and the effects of\nconflict, and from humanitarian catastrophe, lies\nprimarily with the Governments concerned. However,\nit has been well demonstrated that events within a\nparticular country can threaten international peace and\nsecurity and spread misery far beyond its borders.\nWhere Governments are unable or unwilling to take the\nnecessary steps to prevent catastrophe in their own\ncountry, I believe that the international community has\nresponsibilities to protect in those circumstances.\nIt is increasingly evident that instability very\nfrequently arises from situations where human rights\nare abused or denied. The abuse of human rights is also\nat the root of poverty and underdevelopment. Respect\nfor human rights, on the other hand, is an essential\nelement of good governance, and must be at the centre\nof efforts to prevent conflict, and of post-conflict\nreconstruction. Presently, 40 per cent of conflicts that\nappear to have been resolved break out again within\nfive years. We simply must do better in identifying\nemerging problems sooner. We also need to put in\nplace policies and structures that are effective within a\nnew, enforceable legal framework.\nI hope, therefore, that the High-level Panel will\naddress the serious questions involved in international\nintervention, and put forward recommendations that\nwill act as a basis for consensus. We trust that they will\nalso give full and careful consideration to the policies\nand structures that we need in order to carry out our\nresponsibilities towards States and societies at risk of\ninstability. Any such structures must facilitate a\nsustained engagement with those States, to ensure that\nthey receive whatever assistance is needed - political,\nhumanitarian and economic - to avert instability or a\nreturn to conflict. In addressing those problems on the\nbasis of the report of the High-level Panel, let us not\nsacrifice substance on the altar of process.\nIreland welcomes the increasing role of regional\nand subregional organizations in crisis management,\nunder the overall authority of the Security Council. The\nEuropean Union is engaged in developing its role in\nconflict prevention and crisis management, while fully\nrecognizing the central role and authority of the United\nNations. I am pleased to state that during Ireland\u00eds\nrecent presidency of the European Union, important\nprogress was achieved in implementing the Joint\nDeclaration on United Nations-European Union\nCooperation in Crisis Management. It was agreed in\n38\n\nJune, during our presidency, that the European Union\nwill make a rapid response capability available, and at\nthe service of the United Nations. That will take effect\non an initial basis in 2005, with the full complement of\n1,500 troops being ready and available by 2007.\nThe efforts of the African Union and the\nEconomic Community of West African States in crisis\nmanagement have been particularly valuable and\ndeserve support. The African Union\u00eds involvement in\nDarfur, where it currently has 120 monitors with a\nprotection force of 300, is an extremely positive\ndevelopment. It is fully supported by the European\nUnion, including through the African Peace Facility,\nestablished during Ireland\u00eds recent presidency of the\nUnion. The African Union is planning to augment its\ncontingent in Sudan, where it is estimated that a force\nof at least 5,000 may be necessary to assure a secure\nenvironment for the people of Darfur. The European\nUnion is ready to increase its backing for the African\nUnion\u00eds effort accordingly.\nWhatever political difficulties may have arisen in\nDarfur, the people there did not deserve to suffer\nmassacre, rape and famine, or to see their villages and\ncrops destroyed and their livestock driven off. When\nthe depredations of the ruthless militias were unleashed\nupon them, they looked in vain for the even-handed\nprotection of their Government.\nI want to recognize the efforts of United Nations\nagencies and non-governmental organizations \u00f3\nincluding Irish organizations such as GOAL, Concern\nand Tr\u00dbcaire \u00f3 that responded so quickly and\ngenerously to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. The\ndedication of humanitarian aid workers must also be\napplauded.\nThe humanitarian needs in Darfur still remain\nimmense. I appeal for continued support from the\ninternational community to meet the funding shortfall.\nIreland has contributed almost $6 million in\nGovernment-funded aid so far this year to assist the\nhumanitarian effort there through United Nations\nagencies as well as through Irish and international non-\ngovernmental organizations. The Irish people have\nbeen greatly moved by the suffering in Darfur and have\nbeen generous in providing additional, non-government\nfinancial support for the relief effort.\nI also wish to pay tribute to the leadership of the\nSecretary-General in insisting on an appropriate\nresponse from the Security Council. I welcome the\nrecent adoption by the Security Council of resolution\n1564 (2004), although it is a matter of regret and\nbewilderment to many that the resolution did not\nreceive the unanimous backing of Council members. I\nhope that the Council will now unite in seeking to\nassert its will and bring an end to a situation that is an\naffront to humanity.\nI urge the authorities in the Sudan to fulfil, with\nthe utmost urgency, the obligations that have been\nimposed on them by the Security Council. They must\ncooperate closely with the monitors deployed by the\nAfrican Union. They must ensure that the Janjaweed\nmilitia are brought under control and disarmed and that\npersons responsible for crimes and serious violations of\nhuman rights are brought to justice. And they must\nensure that secure conditions are restored so that\npeople can return voluntarily to their homes. I also\nurge all parties in the Abuja talks, including the rebel\ngroups, to show flexibility and goodwill so that the\nunderlying problems of Darfur can be resolved in a\npeaceful manner.\nOnce again, we meet in the General Assembly\nHall under the shadow of terrorism. The recent\nappalling images from Beslan provide a further\nemphatic demonstration of the moral bankruptcy of\nterrorism. The fact that those attacks targeted innocent\nchildren, along with the consequent trauma caused to\nchildren worldwide who saw the torn bodies of the\nchildren and mothers of Beslan on their television\nscreens, make them all the more heinous. They\nreinforce, if reinforcement were needed, the absolute\nduty of Member States of the United Nations to\ncooperate effectively in identifying and bringing to\njustice those who plan, direct, finance, facilitate and\ncarry out terrorist acts.\nTerrorist acts are always reprehensible, and those\nwho carry them out bear full responsibility for them.\nThat is true irrespective of any underlying factors that\nmight exist, such as national or civil conflict or\noppressive economic or social conditions. We must\nshow determination to confront and face down\nterrorists when they test our resolve through their\ninvolvement in heinous acts of violence designed to\nterrorize the public into conceding to their distorted\nview of the world. But we also have to be smart to win.\nTerrorism can rarely be defeated by exclusively\nmilitary or security means, although those means are\nobviously a very necessary component in the fight\n39\n\nagainst terrorism. It is necessary, at the same time, to\naddress the root causes of terrorism. I made that point\nwhen I addressed the General Assembly in the\naftermath of the atrocities of 11 September, and I make\nno apologies for repeating it today. Let there be no\nmisunderstanding. I offer no excuses for terrorism.\nTerrorism is evil. But it is my strong belief that people\nare not born evil. At a certain point in their lives,\nsomething - perhaps a particular event or the\nexperience of indoctrination - causes them to embrace\nevil. To seek to address that root cause is not to be soft\non terrorism, it is the intelligent way to attack\nterrorism.\nTerrorism tests the effectiveness of our national\nand collective security systems, but it also tests the\nquality of our institutions, including our systems of\njustice, and the strength of our values. As we seek to\nprotect ourselves, we must ensure that those\ninstitutions remain strong, that democratic values are\nnot undermined, that our systems of justice are not\ncompromised and that our struggle is conducted in full\nrespect for international law and human rights norms.\nIf we fail to do that, any success we achieve over\nterrorists will be at the expense of the way of life we\nseek to protect.\nThe people of Israel and Palestine continue to\nsuffer from violence that is as futile as it is tragic. The\nroot cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a struggle\nover land. The land must be shared by agreement\narrived at through negotiation between the parties to\nthe conflict. The continuing unilateral expansion of\nsettlements and the construction and maintenance of\nthe separation barrier on the West Bank will make the\nconflict more difficult to resolve. The entire international\ncommunity - particularly Israel\u00eds friends \u00f3 need to\nsend that clear and unambiguous message to the Israeli\nGovernment and the people of Israel.\nIreland acknowledges the right, indeed the\nresponsibility, of the Israeli Government to protect its\npeople, including, if it so wishes, by a security fence\nalong its recognized borders. However, the building of\nthe fence in the West Bank serves to divide Palestinian\ncommunities and creates severe hardship for them. It\nwill also serve to perpetuate the so-called facts on the\nground, and make it more difficult to reach a final\nsettlement. The advisory opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice has given clear guidance on the fence\nthat should be given careful consideration by those\nwhose policies and actions it addresses.\nThe Palestinian Authority must also assume its\nresponsibilities under the road map, notwithstanding\nthe difficulties it faces. Effective and responsible\nleadership is required. The Palestinian people can best\nachieve their sovereignty by restoring national\ndiscipline and rejecting the path of violence.\nIreland, in common with its EU partners,\ncontinues to believe that the only way to reach a\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict is through the\nQuartet road map. In the Tullamore Declaration, issued\nduring Ireland\u00eds recent presidency of the European\nUnion, EU ministers welcomed the expressed intention\nof Prime Minister Sharon to withdraw from Gaza and\nacknowledged the impetus that such a withdrawal\ncould give to the peace process, as long as it met\ncertain conditions, including that it take place in the\ncontext of the implementation of the road map.\nI therefore urge Israel and the Palestinian\nAuthority to cooperate closely with the Quartet to\nensure that the withdrawal from Gaza is accompanied\nby the full and effective assumption by the Palestinian\nAuthority of its responsibilities in the territory, and that\na momentum towards the full implementation of the\nroad map is developed.\nThe passage of Security Council resolution 1546\n(2004) and the subsequent establishment of the Interim\nGovernment of Iraq, represented a crucial coming\ntogether by the international community on the\nimportance of reconstruction in Iraq. It is vital that that\nGovernment should be able to move ahead and\nestablish a full democratic mandate. However, the\nsecurity situation in Iraq remains a matter of grave\nconcern to us all, and the challenges facing the new\nGovernment are great. An end to the lethal violence\nthat is disrupting the normal development of that\ncountry is essential.\nIreland has always seen the role of the United\nNations as central to the issue of reconstructing Iraq.\nWe therefore welcome the forthcoming return of the\nUnited Nations mission. Ireland and its EU partners\nwill seek to ensure that that mission is provided with\nthe necessary security to allow it to carry out its\nfunctions.\nThe Irish and British Governments continue to\nwork in close partnership to consolidate peace and\npolitical stability in Northern Ireland. Since the Good\nFriday Agreement of 1998, considerable progress has\nbeen made in improving and normalizing life in\n40\n\nNorthern Ireland. In our view, the complete\nimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains\ndefinitively the best way forward.\nThe elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly\nlast November gave leadership mandates to the Sinn\nFein party and the Democratic Unionist Party in their\nrespective nationalist and unionist communities. Since\nthen, both Governments have engaged in intensive\ndiscussions with all the parties to finally resolve the\nkey issues of confidence that have thus far frustrated\nthe full achievement of peace and political stability in\nNorthern Ireland. Those key issues include ending\nparamilitary activity in all its forms; completing the\nprocess of decommissioning Irish Republican Army\nweapons; the implementation by the British\nGovernment of the agreed programme of normalization\nand demilitarization; ensuring that the new policing\nservice is supported by all sections of the community\nand resolving the related issue of the devolution of\njustice and policing powers; and obtaining\ncommitments from all parties to fully participate in the\ninstitutions of the Agreement.\nThose were the issues that were addressed in\nthree days of intensive talks that were convened by\nboth Governments in Leeds Castle in England last\nweek. Substantial progress was made in the talks\nregarding the issues of paramilitarism and arms\ndecommissioning. As Prime Minister Blair said after\nthe talks, the contours of the paramilitary question are\nnow in sight of being resolved, to be accompanied by\nsubsequent demilitarization, as agreed in the joint\ndeclaration issued by the British and Irish\nGovernments last October. In addition, significant\nprogress was made with regard to the policing issue\nand the devolution of those powers to devolved\ninstitutions in Northern Ireland.\nRegrettably, it was not possible to achieve\nagreement among the parties themselves on the\nquestion of the operation of the political institutions of\nthe Agreement. Talks are continuing in Belfast this\nweek to see if the gaps between the parties on that\nissue can be resolved. The gaps are narrow and can,\nand must, be overcome at the earliest possible date. It\nwas noteworthy in that regard that the leader of the\nDemocratic Unionist Party, Mr. Ian Paisley, made the\npoint immediately after the talks that a golden\nopportunity has been available to realize a stable and\nentirely peaceful future. For our part, the Irish\nGovernment is open to considering changes that would\nimprove the workings of the institutions while\nmaintaining compliance with the fundamentals of the\nAgreement, and we have brought forward proposals in\nthat regard. But, I reiterate, as the Taoiseach emphasized\nlast weekend, such changes must not disturb the\nfundamental balance of the Good Friday Agreement, in\nparticular its key power-sharing provisions.\nThe resolution of those institutional questions\nwould allow both Governments to bring forward a\ncomprehensive package providing a template for\npolitical stability in Northern Ireland. It would be a\ntragedy if the failure to bridge the remaining gaps on\nthat institutional matter frustrated the goal of\ndefinitively removing the issue of arms from politics in\nNorthern Ireland. The people, rightly, would not\nunderstand why that long-awaited prize was denied\nbecause of a reluctance to fully embrace the structures\nof partnership and power-sharing.\nIf, on the other hand, those institutional issues\ncan be resolved and a comprehensive agreement then\nbrought forward, we can finally liberate partnership\npolitics in Northern Ireland and allow its committed\nand talented politicians \u00f3 from all sides of the\ncommunity \u00f3 to collectively get on with the job of\nproviding better governance, a prospering economy\nand a fair society for all of the people.\nI will conclude where I began, on the need to\nrededicate ourselves to the reinvigoration of this great\nOrganization.\nNext year will be a year in which important\ndecisions on the future of the United Nations must be\ntaken. We need to rededicate ourselves to the principles\nand purposes for which this Organization was founded.\nWe need to restore the sense of ambition and idealism\nthat illuminated the United Nations at its inception. We\nneed, above all, to build an Organization that is results-\noriented and that can demonstrate that politics is the\nmost effective means of resolving conflict. Let us make\n2005 the year in which the United Nations is reborn\nstrong, effective and respected, as the founding fathers\nintended it to be."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, to join those\nwho have spoken before me in extending warm\ncongratulations on behalf of my country, my delegation\nand myself for your brilliant election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. The\nChairman of the African Union, His Excellency\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, already expressed here a few\ndays ago our continent\u2019s gratitude to the international\ncommunity, which, by choosing you, has made one of\nAfrica\u2019s most illustrious sons President of the General\nAssembly. We naturally associate ourselves with that\nexpression of gratitude. We wish you every success in\ncarrying out your lofty mission, and you know you\nhave always had Niger\u2019s support. To your predecessor,\n21\n\nHis Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte, I should like to\nexpress our congratulations on the skill, enthusiasm\nand authority with which he conducted the work of the\nfifty-eighth session of the Assembly in a difficult\ninternational context.\nToday, the international community finds itself at\na crossroads. International peace and security \u2014\nalready sorely tested by recurrent armed conflicts \u2014\nare subjected to threats or bloody attacks of terrorist\nacts, which further darken the global atmosphere of\nuncertainty and insecurity. In your opening statement,\nMr. President, you mentioned one of those persistent\nand bloody conflicts \u2014 that of the Middle East, a\nconflict that costs so much to humanity in terms of\nhuman lives, financial resources and lost hope. That\nregion\u2019s macabre statistics remind us \u2014 as if that were\nstill necessary \u2014 of the urgent need to bring the parties\nto the negotiating table on the basis of the road map,\nwhich the Security Council itself endorsed through its\nresolution 1515 (2003).\nToday, in addition to the Palestinian problem and\nin light of Iraq, the situation in the Middle East is\ncentral to world peace and security as never before.\nWith respect to Iraq \u2014 a country with which Niger\nshares the same faith, Islam, the basis of our common\nmembership in the Organization of the Islamic\nConference \u2014 we cannot fail to deplore so much loss\nof human life and so much blind violence, which are\nthe daily lot of the Iraqi people. We earnestly hope that\ngreater, revitalized international cooperation will\nenable us to swiftly establish free and democratic\ninstitutions in Iraq, put an end to the chaos that seems\nto have taken root there and bring to the country the\npeace and stability necessary for its socio-economic\ndevelopment.\nNiger, as a member of the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference Contact Group on Jammu and\nKashmir, believes that a sustained dialogue between\nIndia and Pakistan will make it possible to lay the\nfoundation for a peaceful solution to that conflict by\nenabling the people of Kashmir to exercise their right\nto self-determination, in accordance with the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions.\nConcerning Western Sahara, Niger reaffirms its\nsupport for United Nations efforts with a view to\nreaching a just and comprehensive settlement of the\nconflict. The commendable actions of the Secretary-\nGeneral should be continued and supported until we\nsee a successful conclusion, in conformity with the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, particularly\nSecurity Council resolutions 1495 (2003) and\n1541 (2004).\nIn Niger, at the end of a long and sometimes\npainful process, we have established a political system\nin which a multitude of parties, private media and civil\nsociety organizations flourish, all of them under the\nprotective umbrella of a constitution that guarantees\nthe separation of powers and an independent judiciary.\nHis Excellency Mr. Tandja Mamadou, President of the\nRepublic since the democratic elections of\n22 November 1999, invited the people of Niger on\n14 September 2004 to vote in new presidential and\nlegislative elections that will be held starting on\n13 November 2004. That will be the first time since\n1991 \u2014 when the multiparty system was established in\nNiger \u2014 that a fully democratic mandate has been\ncompleted. And it will be successfully, because in our\ncountry, social peace has returned, State authority has\nbeen restored, the economy is back on track and the\npeople of Niger have new hope. On 24 July, the\nbuilding of democratic structures was completed\nthrough municipal and local elections, to the great\nsatisfaction of everyone.\nThe restored status of the State has made it\npossible \u2014 thanks to the personal intervention of\nPresident Tandja Mamadou \u2014 to quickly overcome the\nresistance of the remaining few who were still opposed\nto the expanded polio vaccination programme. Here, I\nmust sincerely thank the international community \u2014\nparticularly the World Health Organization, UNICEF,\nthe Centres for Disease Control of the United States\nand Rotary International \u2014 for having effectively\nassisted us in our efforts in that fight.\nAt the external level, our public and private\nbilateral partners who left Niger before 1999 have\nsince returned. Niger\u2019s presidency of the West African\nEconomic and Monetary Union and, last year, of the\nCommunity of Sahelo-Saharan States has given greater\nvisibility to our external action aimed at peace and\nsecurity in Africa. In particular, that action has taken\nthe form of sending a Niger contingent to C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, military observers to the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo and civilian police components to\nBurundi, the Central African Republic and Timor-\nLeste. All that has convinced us that the international\ncommunity\u2019s support is more essential today than ever\nbefore to help Africa strengthen the capacities of its\n22\n\nsubregional institutions and those of its continental\norganization, the African Union.\nUnder the leadership of President Olusegun\nObasanjo, the African Union is working ceaselessly to\nprevent conflicts in African countries where peace\nreigns, to consolidate peace and security where \u2014 as in\nGuinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone or Liberia \u2014 the\npopulations have barely emerged from a situation of\npolitical instability or bloody armed conflicts, and,\nlastly, to extinguish the hotbeds of tension persisting in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nBurundi and the Sudan.\nOur experience with conflict prevention and\nresolution in Africa teaches us that the golden rule in\nthat respect is to have confidence in subregional\ninstitutions and the African Union and to support them\nwith consistent logistical and financial means. In that\nregard, Niger welcomes the decision taken by the\nSecurity Council to support the African Union\u2019s\ndecision to strengthen and expand the observation\nmission in Darfur and to encourage member States to\nprovide all the equipment and logistical, financial and\nmaterial resources required for the mission\u2019s swift\nexpansion. We earnestly hope that the various parties\nto the conflict will respond positively to the appeals\ncoming from Africa and elsewhere to swiftly put an\nend to that tragedy and to bring about a comprehensive\npeace agreement, on which the advent of a peaceful\nSudan will depend.\nWithin the framework of Africa\u2019s new\ndevelopment initiatives, the heads of State of the\nAfrican Union agreed, during a special summit held\nrecently in Ouagadougou, to place employment at the\ncentre of their political, economic and social policies.\nAs rightly pointed out by His Excellency Blaise\nCompaor\u00e9, President of Burkina Faso and host of the\nsummit, Africa needs the effective support of the\ninternational community to implement the decisions of\nOuagadougou.\nFrom the Millennium Declaration to the world\nconferences and summits that followed it, many\ninternational decisions made the fight against poverty a\nworld priority and a major challenge for humanity.\nHow, then, can it be that hundreds of millions of\npeople continue to languish in abject poverty and total\ndestitution? How can it be that, in this era of\ntechnological and scientific advances, HIV/AIDS and\nother pandemics continue to wreak havoc throughout\nthe world, particularly in Africa? How can it be that, at\na time of globalization, many parts of the planet \u2014\nparticularly the least developed countries \u2014 are still\ntotally excluded from international trade? And how can\nit be that, despite the commitments undertaken through\nthe relevant international conventions, the global\nenvironment continues insidiously to deteriorate,\ndangerously jeopardizing the future of generations to\ncome?\nIn light of that situation, and in view of the dearth\nof financial resources to address the crucial problems\nassailing humanity, we must wonder about the\nexistence of real political will on the part of rich\ncountries to help the most impoverished countries\novercome abject poverty. The Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS and the World Solidarity Fund for the\nElimination of Poverty \u2014 whose creation we\nwelcome \u2014 suffer from a cruel lack of resources.\nFurthermore, we believe the modalities for\ngranting those resources to eligible countries should be\nmodelled after those in force for the funds obtained in\nthe framework of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries\nInitiative, in order to ensure management that is both\ntransparent and responsible.\nWe have to face the reality. Given the economic\nstagnation, poverty and the lack of prospects that are\nserious threats for social stability and the young\ndemocracies of developing countries, international\ncooperation is the key to achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals \u2014 as long as developed and\ndeveloping countries agree to assume their respective\nresponsibilities. In this respect, the commitments made\nin Doha to promote a just trade, the Monterrey\nConsensus on Financing for Development and the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation on Sustainable\nDevelopment remain the cornerstones for\nimplementation of the Goals.\nHowever, the meagre results achieved in the\nimplementation of conclusions from major forums\nprompt the international community as a whole to re-\nexamine its conscience. The upcoming high-level\ndialogue on financing for development should be an\nopportunity to once again place at the core of the\ndebate the important issue of the mobilization of\nresources for development. In this respect, taxation at a\nlevel to be agreed upon \u2014 as was recalled at the last\nsummit on poverty \u2014 on all international financial\ntransactions could provide the substantial funding so\n23\n\nnecessary for attaining the Millennium Development\nGoals.\nEndemic poverty, which affects the African\ncontinent in particular, is not a question of fate. It is\npossible to reduce poverty as long as the international\ncommunity is resolute in tackling it. It is possible to\nreduce poverty if industrialized countries implement\nwithout delay the enhanced programme to alleviate the\ndebt of highly indebted countries and agree to cancel\nall bilateral public debts. It is possible to reduce\npoverty if industrialized countries agree to increase\nofficial development assistance to the level necessary\nto reach the objectives of the Millennium Development\nGoals. It is possible to reduce poverty if industrialized\ncountries resolve to open their markets to commodities\nfrom developing countries, and if raw materials from\nthose countries are purchased at their proper values. It\nis possible to reduce poverty if industrialized countries\neliminate their farming subsidies for cotton and support\nthe countries concerned in their policy for providing\nrural areas with a suitable farming infrastructure and,\nespecially, with small rural facilities.\nLastly, it is possible to reduce poverty if\nglobalization is better managed and if interdependence\nleads to the establishment of an international financial\nand commercial structure that is democratic and able to\nmeet the needs of all parties.\nNot so long ago the international community,\nwith the Group of 8 in the lead, solemnly declared its\ncommitment to support the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD). Today we must\nacknowledge that that great enthusiasm still has not\nmaterialized in concrete actions on a scale that would\nmeet the legitimate aspirations of African continent.\nDespite constant efforts by the African countries, there\nis still much left to be done to meet the objectives\ncontained in that vast and ambitious partnership.\nI am pleased to say here that Niger is very\npleased to work with the Office of the Representative\nof the Secretary-General for NEPAD, as well as with\nthe Office of the High Representative of the United\nNations for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked\nCountries and Small Island Developing States.\nTo conclude, it is important that the\nDesertification Convention be effectively implemented,\na convention that is seen as the best illustration of the\nlink between environmental degradation and poverty.\nSpeaking of environmental degradation, how can\nwe overlook the ecological ravages caused by the\ncurrent locust invasion in part of Africa? Because it did\nnot act in good time, the international community \u2014\nwhich had been warned of this danger far in\nadvance \u2014 must now mobilize, as soon as possible,\nsufficient financial and material means to stop the\nspread of the plague in order to halt the spectre of\nfamine that looms over the populations of northern\nAfrica, the Sahel and West Africa as a whole."

That honour is not only\nrecognition of the contribution of your country, Gabon,\nin world affairs but also a great moment for our\ncontinent, Africa. We are confident that, with your\nwide experience and vast diplomatic skills, you will\nsuccessfully steer the work of the Assembly. My\ndelegation pledges its full support to you during your\ntenure.\nMy delegation would also like to place on record\nour gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for\nhis able and excellent leadership of the General\n18\n\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. As fellow\nislanders, we derived great satisfaction and pride from\nhis unequalled stewardship. He assumed and\ndischarged the high responsibilities of President of the\nAssembly with commitment, dedication and great\ndiplomacy. We thank him for his service to the world\ncommunity.\nAllow me also to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his relentless efforts and\ndetermination to ensure that our Organization\ncontinues to play its role effectively in the international\narena.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking\nplace as we prepare ourselves to tackle and face major\nchallenges and developments over the next 12 months.\nOf particular importance to small island developing\nStates such as my own, 2005 will begin with two major\nevents: the International Meeting for the full and\ncomprehensive review of the implementation of the\nBarbados Programme of Action, which will be hosted\nby Mauritius; and the World Conference on Disaster\nReduction, to be held in Japan.\nTen years after Barbados, small island developing\nStates continue to face practically the same challenges\nin their drive to achieve sustainable development.\nTheir small size, fragile ecosystems, geographic\nisolation and limited resources, compounded by the\nthreats of climate change, rising sea levels and natural\ndisasters, make them particularly vulnerable. While it\nis a fact that many developing countries face the\nincreasing pressures posed by the combined forces of\nglobalization and trade liberalization, such pressures\nare even more exacerbating for small island developing\nStates. Their small markets and the limited market\naccess for their products constrain them greatly in their\nefforts to integrate smoothly into the global economy.\nThey also suffer from natural vulnerabilities to\nphenomena such as hurricanes, earthquakes and\ntsunamis. The devastation caused by the recent series\nof hurricanes in the Caribbean islands demonstrates the\nextent of our vulnerability. It is true that those\nvulnerabilities have been recognized in a variety of\ninternational forums, but such recognition has yet to\ncrystallize in concrete actions in favour of small island\ndeveloping States. The precarious situation of our\nStates is of direct concern to the international\ncommunity as a whole.\nMay we then resolve to take bold initiatives to\nimplement meaningfully the Barbados Programme and\nto respond to related emerging issues so that small\nisland developing States can build resilience and\ncapacity and be integrated fully into the global\neconomy? Similarly, in the multilateral trading system,\nwe expect the emergence of an environment conducive\nto enabling our States to improve their\ncompetitiveness, their market access and the\ndiversification of their economies. We therefore expect\nthe World Trade Organization to soon establish a work\nprogramme for small economies.\nAs a small island developing State, Mauritius is\nindeed honoured to host the International Meeting. The\nInternational Meeting should be not only a collective\ngathering to reflect on the specificities of our concerns.\nIt should also be a landmark in the history of the major\nUnited Nations conferences, with deliverable outcomes\nand the means necessary for their implementation.\nWe in Mauritius are leaving no stone unturned to\nmake that event truly historic and memorable. It is\nimportant that the entire international community\nparticipate in that meeting, which, allow me to point\nout, is a United Nations meeting on small island\ndevelopment States and not a meeting for those States\nalone.\n(spoke in French)\nThe work to be undertaken by the small island\ndeveloping States is based upon sustainable\ndevelopment and the restricted resources available to\nthose countries. How can one not welcome, therefore,\nthe decision taken by the Government of Burkina Faso,\nhost of the next summit of la Francophonie, which has\nchosen solidarity and sustainable development as the\ntheme of the summit.\nOur preoccupation with sustainable\ndevelopment \u2014 the basis of the Johannesburg\nSummit \u2014 is even stronger in the context of\nglobalization today. Although only a handful of\ndeveloping island States are French-speaking, we trust\nthat the Summit will highlight the need for us to find,\nwithin the international community, ways and means to\nhelp small island developing States, which may then\nbecome models for sustainable development.\n(spoke in English)\nGlobal warming, and its related effects on climate\nchange, is now an undisputed reality, and islands suffer\nthe brunt of it, even though \u2014 let me emphasize this \u2014\nwe are the least responsible for the cause. We believe\nthat the Kyoto Protocol is the most appropriate\nmechanism for global action now and in the future, to\naddress the issue of global warming. We call, therefore,\n19\n\nfor its ratification and entry into force, as soon as\npossible.\nAfrica, home to 34 of the world\u2019s 48 poorest\ncountries, remains an enormous challenge for the\nUnited Nations. The deadly spread of HIV and AIDS\ncontinues to claim a devastating toll on the continent,\nparticularly in southern Africa. We in Africa are\ncommitted to further democratize our societies and\ngive our people a rightful voice in the decision-making\nprocess. That is why at the continental level, we are\ndoing all we can, despite our scarce resources, to\nconsolidate the African Union and make it central in\nour collective bid to grapple with the development\nconcerns of our region. Using that perspective, we have\ncome up with our own home-grown programme, the\nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD)\nin order to attain the ultimate goal that we have fixed\nfor ourselves \u2014 the total integration of Africa.\nSince we launched the African Union Peace and\nSecurity Council last May, we have received\nencouraging support from some of our development\npartners. I should like to use this platform to urge the\ninternational community to support the African Union\nin that field to enable it to come to grips with the\nconflicts that continue to divert our attention and\nmeagre resources from our development efforts.\nIn addressing the issue of conflicts on the\ncontinent, the African Union has amply demonstrated\nthat it means business, and any assistance it gets from\nthe international community can only help it to achieve\nits goals. But let me hasten to say that the African\nUnion\u2019s involvement in peace processes should not\ndistract the United Nations Security Council from its\nprimary responsibility to maintain peace and security\nin Africa. Indeed, the Security Council should not\nallow itself to be perceived as being selective in its\napproach with regard to conflicts in various parts of the\nworld. Experiences in the Great Lakes region and in\nWest Africa have shown that the combined efforts of\nthe Security Council and the African Union can bring\ntangible results.\nBefore I leave this part of my statement, let me\nrefer to the unjust treatment that continues to be meted\nout to the Saharawi people who are still struggling for\ntheir right to self-determination. It is the duty of this\nworld body to ensure a speedy conclusion of that\nmatter. In this regard, my delegation reiterates its\nsupport for the Settlement Plan and any other political\ninitiative acceptable to the parties concerned that will\nhelp to take the process forward for a durable and\nsustainable solution. The Saharawi people deserve that\ncommitment from us.\nAs this Assembly is aware, Mauritius has always\nfavoured a bilateral approach in our resolve to restore\nour exercise of sovereignty over the Chagos\nArchipelago which, prior to independence from the\nUnited Kingdom, was unlawfully detached from our\nterritory, in violation of the Declaration on the\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and\nPeoples contained in General Assembly resolution\n1514 (XV), and Assembly resolutions 2066 (XX), 2232\n(XXI) and 2357 (XXII). Such bilateral approaches\nhave unfortunately not yielded any result so far and\ncertain recent regrettable unilateral actions by the\nUnited Kingdom have not been helpful.\nWhile we shall continue to favour a settlement of\nthe matter through dialogue, we shall use all avenues\nopen to us in order to exercise our full sovereign rights\nover the Chagos Archipelago. The Assembly should\nalso note that this issue has a tragic human dimension.\nBefore Mauritius acceded to its independence, all the\ninhabitants of the Chagos were forced to leave the land\nof their birth, where they had lived for several\ngenerations. The plight of those inhabitants must now\nbe comprehensively addressed.\nIn the same context, my delegation looks forward\nto the resumption of dialogue with the French\nGovernment over Tromelin island.\nMauritius is a firm believer and, indeed, a keen\nplayer in regional cooperation and integration, not as\nan end in itself but as a sure means to enable us to\nintegrate the global economy. We consider regional\ncooperation as a necessary step to enable Africa to\nbenefit from globalization. We have therefore spared\nno effort to promote regional cooperation. Since the\nearly 1980s we in Mauritius, have been playing a pro-\nactive role in advancing the objectives of the Abuja\nTreaty. Mauritius is a very active member of the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\n(COMESA) and of the South African Development\nCommunity (SADC).\nAs the new Chair of SADC, we look forward to\nworking very closely with all our fellow member States\nin advancing the objectives of the organization,\npromoting community building through regional\nintegration and aligning national policies for regional\ncooperation so that they stay on course in the\nglobalization process. We will also endeavour to forge\na strong relationship between SADC and its\n20\n\ndevelopment partners as well as with other\nsubregional, continental and multilateral organizations.\nAfter the failure of the WTO Ministerial\nConference at Canc\u00fan, the successful outcome of the\nJuly 2004 General Council meeting has come as a ray\nof hope to put the trade talks back on track. The July\npackage of frameworks and other agreements that the\nWTO members approved will greatly enhance the\nchances for a successful completion of the Doha\nDevelopment Agenda negotiations.\nWe therefore welcome the decision adopted by\nthe WTO General Council to fulfil the development\ndimensions of the Doha Development Agenda, which\nplaces the needs and interests of developing and least\ndeveloped countries at the heart of the Doha Agenda\nwork programme.\nIn that context, let me make an appeal for a\nmeaningful synergy to be established among the\ndevelopment agencies and other United Nations\ninstitutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions,\nin order to ensure that developing countries develop\ntheir capacity to increase their share of world trade as a\nnecessary pathway to prosperity.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains\nextremely preoccupying for all freedom-loving nations\nand peoples. We go on speaking of the need for a\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East,\nwithout realizing that each year the peace and security\nsituation in the region is growing worse.\nOver the past year, we witnessed more targeted\nassassinations, increased terrorist acts, daily\nrecriminations from both sides and an expansion of\nsettlement activities. The illegal construction of a wall\nby Israel in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the\noccupied Palestinian territories has worsened an\nalready complex situation.\nAlmost two years ago the road map called for a\nfinal and comprehensive settlement of the Israel-\nPalestinian conflict by 2005. The year 2005 is at our\ndoorstep and we are still grappling with how to put the\nderailed peace process back on track. We believe that\nthe road map remains the only viable option for peace\nin the region. We call on both Israel and Palestine to\nexercise maximum restraint, undertake confidence-\nbuilding measures and create the appropriate\nenvironment, with the help of the Quartet, to\nimplement the road map.\nMy delegation believes that what is needed today\nis not a wall, but a political solution and a renewed\ncommitment from the international community that\nwould resolve the conflict altogether. Only the creation\nof the much-awaited Palestinian State, existing side by\nside with Israel with secured and recognized borders,\ncan bring peace and stability to the Middle East.\nThe political process in Iraq reached an important\nmilestone last June with the handing over of authority\nto the Iraqi Interim Government. My delegation\nbelieves that the holding of national elections early\nnext year, as required by Security Council resolution\n1546 (2004), will give the people of Iraq a unique\nopportunity to take the destiny of their country into\ntheir own hands. However, the current security\nsituation in Iraq is very disturbing. My delegation\ncondemns all acts of violence that can disrupt Iraq\u2019s\npolitical and economic transition. The international\ncommunity must be fully engaged in its efforts to\nrebuild a safe, democratic and peaceful Iraq.\nGiven the potential threat posed by nuclear\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction, it is a\nmatter of serious concern that we still have not been\nable to find common ground to initiate a process\nleading to complete disarmament. Significant\ndifferences still persist among parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We once\nagain appeal to all Member States to translate their\nstated commitments to the cause of disarmament into\naction.\nMauritius supports and implements fully the\ninternational disarmament treaties such as the\nChemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and\nToxin Weapons Convention and has always supported\nthe various United Nations resolutions related to the\nconsolidation of those regimes, including resolution\n1540 (2004), which focuses on non-proliferation\nissues.\nAlong with our fight against weapons of mass\ndestruction, we should also stay the course against the\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which\nhave been the weapons of choice in recent conflicts,\nparticularly in Africa.\nTerrorist acts continue to create fear and havoc\namong peaceful nations and lead to the loss of lives,\nparticularly among innocent civilians, including\nwomen and children. We should therefore reflect on the\neffectiveness of the international response to terrorism.\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that the war against\ninternational terrorism cannot be won by military\nmight alone. Several reports submitted to this\nAssembly have already amply demonstrated that\n21\n\nproblems such as poverty, social inequality,\nunemployment and illiteracy constitute breeding\ngrounds for terrorism. Genuine international\ncooperation is therefore needed to comprehensively\naddress the root causes of terrorism.\nAllow me to share some thoughts with respect to\nthe future of our Organization. The world emerged\nfrom the Second World War resolved to ensure peace\namong nations, and the United Nations was born with\nthat vision firmly in mind. Now, more than half a\ncentury later, in full recognition of the drastic and far-\nreaching changes that have transformed our world,\nthere is full consensus for a reform of our\nOrganization.\nThere is indeed general agreement that the\ncurrent structure of the Security Council needs to be\nreviewed to reflect the new realities of the world. We\nfirmly believe that a greater commitment has to be\ndemonstrated by every member of the Organization in\norder to reach an agreement on a reformed Security\nCouncil based on wider representation, transparency\nand equitable geographical distribution with the\ninclusion of developing countries from Africa, Asia\nand Latin America as permanent members. Here, let\nme reiterate our conviction that India fully deserves to\nhave that status. In that respect, I need to underscore\nthe need for small island States, which are scattered\nover all the oceans of the world, to have an adequate\nvoice in the Council.\nIt is therefore our sincere hope that the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change appointed by\nthe Secretary-General will make concrete and practical\nrecommendations to make the United Nations more\ncredible and responsive to the expectations of people in\nevery corner of the globe. The high-level plenary\nmeeting, which is to be held next year, would also be\nan opportunity for us to take stock of progress made in\nrespect to the goals set in the major United Nations\nconferences and summits.\nMauritius continues to be an active supporter of\nthe United Nations in its efforts to save succeeding\ngenerations from war and suffering and to promote\nsocial progress and better standards of life. Mauritius\nbelieves that a strengthened United Nations, evolving\nwithin the framework of a credible multilateral system,\nis the only effective instrument at the disposal of the\ninternational community to bring order and ensure the\ncoherence of international economic, social and\nenvironmental policies."

        "file_text": "I would like to start by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I\npledge the full support of my delegation for your\nendeavours. I would also like to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for his\nable presidency.\nWe are world leaders at a time when our globe is\nundergoing an important phase of adaptation to new\nrealities, opportunities and challenges.\nAs the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, frequently states, we now possess the know-\nhow to address our common concerns. The Millennium\nSummit, which was the largest gathering of world\nleaders, produced a historical document - the\nMillennium Declaration - which charts the right\ncourse for humanity in the new millennium.\nThe goals that the Millennium Declaration\ndefined for humanity are ambitious, yet achievable.\nReducing hunger and extreme poverty, spreading\nuniversal primary education, halting infectious diseases\nand reducing child mortality within 15 years continue\nto be urgent tasks.\nUniversal humanitarian challenges and chronic\npolitical-military conflicts are compounded with new\nand asymmetrical threats such as terrorism, narcotic\ndrugs, organized crime, the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and environmental problems.\nOn the other hand, racism, anti-Semitism,\nprejudicial attitudes against the tenets of certain creeds\nand cultures, among them those of Islam, and xenophobia\nadd fuel to those menaces. In addition, the special and\nurgent needs of the African continent continue to\nrequire a collective response.\nThe United Nations system should be encouraged to\nintensify its role in addressing those issues. Confidence in\nthe international order and in international institutions\nshould not be undermined. A more effective and credible\nUnited Nations would be better able to face the\ncommon challenges of today. The Security Council\nshould have a more representative and balanced\ncharacter; indeed, representation in the Council must\nbe inclusive and fair. That will increase its legitimacy\n25\n\nand efficiency. In that respect, I would like to\ncommend the efforts of the Secretary-General.\nThe correlation between good governance and\npeace and prosperity is valid both domestically and\ninternationally. Therefore, a global agenda for reform\nshould cover all aspects of domestic and international\nlife. Each member of the international community has\na stake in, and responsibility for, the implementation of\nsuch an agenda.\nOn our part, my Government, fully conscious of\nthat correlation, has carried out sweeping political and\neconomic reforms in the past two years. We have thus\nupgraded and deepened our democracy and\nconsolidated an accountable, transparent and efficient\nadministration and a dynamic civil society upholding\nthe rule of law and human rights. The expectations of\nour people, as well as the relevant United Nations and\nEuropean Union standards, inspired us in our reform\ndrive. I take pride in the fact that many observers, both\nin the west and in the east, have seen in our experience\nthe perfect embodiment of modernity, progress,\nidentity and tradition.\nI should like to take this opportunity to confirm\nTurkey's candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the\nSecurity Council for the term 2009-2010. In spite of its\nsubstantial contributions to peace and security, Turkey\nhas not been a member of the Council for almost half a\ncentury. Therefore we rightfully expect the support of\nthe General Assembly for our candidacy.\nOur bid for a non-permanent seat is in tune with\nTurkey's larger efforts to secure peace, stability and\nsecurity in its region and beyond. Turkey figures\nprominently in humanitarian activities, from Palestine to\nDarfur. We have been contributing increasing numbers to\ninternational peacekeeping missions whose geographical\ndistribution ranges from Bosnia to Afghanistan.\nTurkey has a unique position as the only member\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference that is\nalso a candidate for membership in the European\nUnion. That position enables us to facilitate interaction\nand dialogue between the Islamic world and the West.\nTurkey has numerous achievements to its credit\nin the process of helping to create an environment\nconducive to development, stability and progress in our\nregion and beyond. The Black Sea Economic\nCooperation, the Economic Cooperation Organization\nand the Stability Pact are good examples to that effect.\nMy Government has been taking a peaceful and\nproblem-solving approach to world affairs. On the\nchronic issue of Cyprus, my Government fully\nsupported Secretary-General Kofi Annan\u00eds good-\noffices mission, and we cooperated closely with him.\nThe Secretary-General\u00eds settlement plan was the result\nof four years of serious negotiations between the two\nsides. They were conducted on the basis of a new\nbi-zonal partnership with a federal Government and\ntwo constituent States. The plan was put to separate\nreferendums, with the prior agreement of all parties\nconcerned. The Annan plan was overwhelmingly\naccepted by the Turkish Cypriots, but the Greek\nCypriot leadership chose to reject it.\nI profoundly regret the fact that an opportunity to\nresolve the longstanding problem of Cyprus was thus\nmissed. As a result, a chance to grant fresh credibility\nto the United Nations was lost. A possible source of\ninspiration for peacemakers elsewhere, in the Middle\nEast or the Caucasus, also disappeared.\nThe Secretary-General, in his report to the\nSecurity Council, clearly stated that the referendums\ndrastically changed the situation on the island. It\nconfirmed, once again, the existence of two equal peoples\nand their separate rights to decide their own fate.\nThe Secretary-General also called on the\nmembers of the Security Council to\n'give a strong lead to all States to cooperate both\nbilaterally and in international bodies, to\neliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers\nthat have the effect of isolating the Turkish\nCypriots and impeding their development'\n(S/2004/437, p. 2).\nTurkey remains committed to a lasting settlement\nin Cyprus. Five months have passed since the Turkish\nCypriots, responding to the call of the international\ncommunity, voted courageously in favour of the United\nNations plan. However, they have yet to be rewarded\nfor expressing their will to reunify the island. We urge\nthe Security Council positively to respond to the\nSecretary-General\u00eds call. We also appeal to United\nNations Member States to take concrete steps, at the\nbilateral level, to put an end to the isolation and\npunishment of the people of the Turkish Republic of\nNorthern Cyprus.\n26\n\nTurkey has been strongly supporting, and will\ncontinue to support, the preservation of peace and\nstability in south-east Europe.\nWe are glad to note that considerable progress has\nbeen achieved in this region thanks to the sustained\nefforts of the international community and of the\nBalkan countries themselves.\nTurkey is determined to sustain the promising and\nconstructive atmosphere in our relations with Greece.\nWe hope that the improvement in bilateral relations\nwill continue in the coming period. Our wide-ranging\ncooperation is expanding in every field. That will\nfacilitate the settlement of all pending issues. It will\nalso result in a climate of cooperation beneficial to the\ntwo countries, as well as peace, stability and security in\nthe region as a whole.\nTurkey believes that it is high time to start taking\nconcrete steps towards eliminating the existing\n\u00ecfrozen\u00ee conflicts in the southern Caucasus, such as\nthose in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and South\nOssetia. As a neighbouring country, we are actively\ncontributing to efforts aimed at achieving stability and\nprosperity in that region. To that end, we have been\nencouraging all the parties concerned while facilitating\nthe ongoing process of dialogue. We hope that the\nAbkhazian conflict and the problems in South Ossetia\nwill be overcome by peaceful means, within the\nframework of the territorial integrity and sovereignty\nof Georgia.\nMy Government supports a just and lasting\nsolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on the basis\nof the fundamental principles of international law, the\nterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan and good-neighbourly\nrelations. We expect the Armenian Government to fully\ncomply with the relevant United Nations resolutions to\nreach such a solution.\nThe Middle East problem and the situation in Iraq\nand Afghanistan are the major conflicts responsible for\ncompounding instability in the world and are leading to\nincreasingly serious consequences.\nThe road map is the only available framework for\na comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian\nproblem. Benefiting from its traditional ties with the\nparties, Turkey has already offered its active\ncontribution to the implementation of the road map. We\nalso support every effort that is initiated and\ncoordinated in that context.\nWe join the call made by the Quartet yesterday.\nThe resumption of the negotiating process between the\ntwo parties should remain the central objective of\ncurrent efforts. It is important, likewise, that both sides\nfulfil their performance criteria as laid out in the road\nmap. Terrorist attacks against the Israeli people must\nstop. So must the deliberate destruction of Palestinian\nlives and properties. The process of the reform of\nPalestinian institutions must be advanced. Israeli\nsettlement activities must be immediately halted. The\nruling of the International Court of Justice must be\nrespected. And the living conditions of the Palestinians\nneed to be urgently improved.\nAny settlement would be incomplete without\nprogress on all tracks, including those involving Syria\nand Lebanon.\nMy Government is focused on contributing to the\nimprovement of the situation in Iraq. We appreciate the\nmassive resources and political efforts mobilized by\nthe United States Administration and the international\ncommunity for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\nIraq. We sincerely hope those efforts yield the desired\nresults soon. However, the humanitarian, political and\nsecurity difficulties faced by the people of Iraq\ncontinue to adversely affect one another. It goes\nwithout saying that developments in Iraq are also\naffecting my country and causing suffering for my\npeople, while, as we are a neighbouring country, most\nof Iraq\u00eds humanitarian needs are being supplied\nthrough Turkey.\nThe Iraqi transition is not only about the fate of\nthe Iraqi nation. It is about the future of peace and\nprosperity in the whole region and beyond. That is the\nmotive for Turkey's strong support of a united,\nterritorially intact and democratic Iraq - an Iraq that is at\npeace with itself and with its neighbours. That should\nand can only be achieved with the full participation and\nsupport of the Iraqi people as a whole. More United\nNations involvement would facilitate that task. The\nseries of neighbouring countries meetings, initiated by\nTurkey, is also a valuable instrument to be taken into\naccount. After all, as Iraq\u00eds success will be our\ncollective success, so its failure will also be a\ncollective failure. For its part, Turkey will continue to\nsupport the Iraqi interim Government\u00eds efforts in\npaving the way to normalcy and democracy.\nTurkey's traditional support for the Afghan\npeople will continue. The establishment of security,\n27\n\nstability and a democratic system in Afghanistan is\nanother urgent task. Freeing that country from\nterrorism, extremism and narcotics is of crucial\nimportance for the international community. We should\nall work to make the upcoming elections a significant\nstep towards those ends.\nWe all agree that terrorism has no justification. It\ncan never claim to respect any religion, nation or\ncause. Indiscriminate killing of innocent people, be it\nin New York, Istanbul, Baghdad, Beslan or elsewhere,\nis a crime against humanity. We condemn those\nterrorist atrocities in the strongest terms.\nAs a country that has long suffered from\nterrorism, Turkey calls for more intensified multilateral\ncooperation. The United Nations system is an\nimportant platform in that respect and we extend our\nfull support to efforts under its aegis.\nWe also strongly believe in the urgent need to\nstrengthen the control regimes for weapons of mass\ndestruction and their delivery systems. We will\ncontinue to support ongoing work to ensure full\nadherence to the legal instruments in that field. The\ncreation of nuclear-weapon-free zones is an important\nway of strengthening peace and security in the world\nand in all regions, including the Middle East.\nTurkey is determined to use every effort and\ndeploy all the means at its disposal in order to\nstrengthen peace and stability in its immediate region\nand beyond. We will try to use the influence of our\nmultidimensional ties and deep-rooted relations to\nachieve that goal. We remain strongly committed to\ntranslating into reality the universal validity of the\nnoble values and principles enshrined in the United\nNations Charter."

        "file_text": "I am honoured by the opportunity to speak before the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf of\nthe people of my Pacific island nation, the Federated\nStates of Micronesia, and on behalf of our President,\nJoseph J. Urusemal.\nAllow me to extend my congratulations to you,\nMr. President, on your well-deserved election to this\nhigh office. I would also like to recognize Mr. Julian\nRobert Hunte of Saint Lucia for his distinguished\nservice as president of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-eighth session.\nSadly, there have been so many recent disasters in\nwhich innocent lives have been lost that time does not\npermit me to mention them all. Whenever we learn of\nhuman suffering brought about by the forces of nature \u2014\nwhether by earthquake, storms or otherwise \u2014 our\nhearts go out to the victims. As Pacific islanders, my\npeople feel a special sympathy for the victims of the\nrecent typhoons and hurricanes in Haiti, Grenada,\nJamaica, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas,\nFlorida and in Japan and China, as well as in our own\ncountry and elsewhere in the Pacific, such as in Guam,\nthe Mariana Islands and in Niue. It does not take a\nscientist to see that such storms are now occurring with\nincreasing frequency and devastating intensity.\nWe must also express our great sadness over the\ncontinuing loss of life at the hands of terrorists, and we\ncondemn in the strongest terms all those who wrongly\nthink their causes are advanced by such misguided\nacts. All human life is precious, but the recent terrorist\natrocity committed against schoolchildren in Beslan,\nRussia, was particularly vile. The world must speak out\nwith one voice in utter contempt of those who were\nresponsible.\nI regret to say that, in addition to working to\ndefeat terrorism, this body must also find more\neffective means of combating genocide that is\nsponsored or tolerated by a Government. There must be\nno refuge for those who would deny entire populations\nthe basic right of existence.\nIt is obvious today that expressions of\ncondemnation and even multilateral treaties do not\ndeter such people. As our technology provides even\nmore effective and readily available means of mass\ndestruction, the bright promise of the coming years\ncould be overwhelmed by an unthinkable nightmare.\nThe people of the Federated States of Micronesia\nknow that even we, the inhabitants of a remote island\nnation, do not have the luxury of remoteness from the\nthreats posed by such crimes against humanity. These\n2\n\nare threats to which all are exposed and from which all\nare at risk. Though our numbers are relatively small,\nmany of our finest young citizens are standing today\nwith others on the front lines against tyranny and\noppression. We will not shirk our commitment, but, if\nthere is any hope of making such crimes a thing of the\npast, that commitment cannot be conditional or\nselective. It must be universal.\nEven if we summon up the will to act collectively\nto put down the darker side of human nature through\ncollective action, we must work much harder on a\nglobal scale to move towards eliminating the\nconditions that provide fertile ground for the sponsors\nof terrorism and genocide. These include conditions of\npoverty, hunger and inadequate access to clean water,\nsanitation, health care and education. All those\nconditions, of course, are familiar to students of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Thanks in no small part to the\nwork of the Organization, statisticians are able to\nidentify significant, even dramatic, progress over the\npast 60 years, and those trends can be expected to\ncontinue as we dedicate ourselves to the attainment of\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\nBut trends do not mean much to the children who\nwill die of starvation today, tomorrow and the day after\ntomorrow. Growth in gross domestic product is of little\ncomfort to the man desperately trying to support a\nfamily on less than $1 a day, who sees no hope of\nimproving his situation. The world \u2014 acting through\nthis and other bodies, in addition to providing direct\nassistance \u2014 must redouble its efforts, because there is\nstill a long way to go, and this planet of ours becomes\nmore dangerous every day.\nAs if what I have just mentioned were not\nchallenging enough, we also now know that the global\ncommunity faces a wide variety of complex tasks in\nprotecting the planet from environmental catastrophe.\nWe humans, sitting at the top of the genetic ladder,\nhave the capacity to foul the nest of Creation, and most\nagree that that is happening to one degree or another.\nOne thing is clear: we are the only ones who can do\nsomething about it. Considerable costs will be\ninvolved, and not just in funds. Some say that the\nindustrialized world must change its deeply ingrained\npatterns of energy consumption and make other\nadjustments. Others say that the developing world must\nswitch to more sustainable development approaches, at\na higher initial cost.\nCan the nations of the world afford the price tag\nof achieving all those things? The economic\nindications are that we can; it is a question of will,\ndetermination and perseverance. There is no lack of\nwealth in this world. By just about any measurement,\npeople in the industrialized world today enjoy a far\nhigher standard of living than has ever been known\nbefore. Many developing countries are not far behind.\nBut, when it comes to actually taking the steps\nnecessary to overcome the dilemmas I have mentioned,\nwe confront the real challenge: to determine the wisest\nallocation of our resources and to act accordingly, in\nthe spirit of the eight Millennium Development Goals.\nIt does not take a great deal of wisdom to\nconclude that mankind must continue to place high\npriority on the eradication of poverty and hunger.\nLikewise, the need for prudence in protecting our\nearthly environment and its resources is increasingly\nobvious. But allocating our resources properly,\nidentifying the correct timing, and acting so as to attain\nthose goals will require virtually every scientific,\neconomic, political and ethical capacity that we can\nsummon.\nThe process must involve an even-handed\napproach, without room for guilt, blame or jealousy.\nWhile there is a real need for action, there is no need\nfor panic. The planet can still be saved, and the social\nconditions for despair can be overcome. We must,\nhowever, all play our respective roles with\ncommitment, compassion and in accordance with an\nequitable division of responsibility. Let us put aside the\nfinger-pointing and the tyranny of self-interest, and let\nus set about the task.\nThere are several issues of concern to my country\nregarding which I would like, briefly, to be more\nspecific.\nFirst, Micronesia looks forward to the convening\nof the International Meeting, in January 2005 in\nMauritius, which will conduct the critical 10-year\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action, focusing\non the particular needs and vulnerabilities of the small\nisland developing States as they pursue sustainable\ndevelopment. During the past 10 years, we have seen\nprogress in implementing the Programme of Action,\nwith the close involvement and support of the\nSecretariat. However, that progress needs to be\naccelerated. The International Meeting will enable us\nto identify and make essential course corrections.\n3\n\nNaturally, over the past 10 years, we have also seen the\nemergence of new challenges and issues that were not\noriginally addressed. Now these can also be\nconsidered. Overall, the outcomes of the International\nMeeting should be target-oriented so that progress in\nimplementing the Programme of Action can be tracked\nand measured.\nOf course, the International Meeting will be\nsuccessful only if the representatives of island States\nare able to attend. Micronesia thus calls upon the donor\ncommunity to provide generous support to the trust\nfund so that island States may be adequately\nrepresented at the Meeting. In that regard, I must\nacknowledge and express appreciation to those\ncountries that have already contributed. Developing-\ncountry partners and developed countries should also\nmake every effort to be represented at the highest\npossible political level to ensure that the International\nMeeting receives the political support it needs for the\neffective implementation of its outcomes.\nPerhaps foremost among the vulnerabilities of\nMicronesia \u2014 together with other members of the\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) \u2014 is our\nextreme exposure to the adverse effects of global\nclimate change. For more than a decade now, we have\nbeen vocal in this body and elsewhere on virtually\nevery aspect of climate change. One aspect of that\nissue is a source of increasing concern to me as the\ndebate evolves beyond whether climate change is real\nto what should be done about it, and that aspect has to\ndo with environmental ethics.\nIn Micronesia, as in most island States, our\npeople have a tradition of living in harmony with\nnature. Consequently, our ecological \u201cfootprint\u201d has\nbeen small. While we who live on islands can and need\nto do more to curb unsustainable practices, it is clear\nthat we have contributed little to the climate crisis and\nthat we can contribute little to its solution. Yet we are\namong the first to be affected and even face possible\nextinction.\nFor the populations of low-lying small islands,\nhowever, practical options are few. Land is in short\nsupply on islands in the best of times, and that land has\nlong been taken. Contrary to the romantic fantasy,\nthere are no desert islands available; island populations\nalready tend to be concentrated. Previous efforts to\nrelocate island populations have brought suffering and\ncultural losses to the people concerned. To those of us\nfacing the prospect of cultural eradication, the\nunabated advancement of already-inflated lifestyles in\nthe industrialized world does not seem a \u201cgreater\ngood\u201d. We continue to support the call of AOSIS for\nimmediate implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.\nExport and licensing income from the bounty of\nMicronesia\u2019s waters and its vast exclusive economic\nzone is by far the greatest contribution to the nation\u2019s\nbudget, next to foreign assistance. Fisheries are also a\nvital resource of virtually every Pacific island country.\nA cooperative approach on the part of coastal States\nand distant-water fishing nations in the sustainable\nconservation and management of those resources is\nessential, since we now know that they are not\ninexhaustible.\nThus, Micronesia welcomes the entry into force\nof the Convention on the Conservation and\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\nCentral and Western Pacific Ocean, established\npursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law\nof the Sea. We call upon all States and entities that\nhave participated in the process of establishing the\nConservation and Management Convention to assign\nhigh priority to cooperating fully in the implementation\nof its provisions.\nI would like to put on record my country\u2019s\ngrowing concern over the practice of deep-sea\ntrawling. The region of the Pacific contains literally\nthousands of seamounts, which scientists are finding to\nbe extremely rich in biodiversity and which hold great\npotential value for future generations. Yet, short-\nsightedly, too many are dragging trawl nets over these\ndeep-ocean areas, unknowing and uncaring as to the\ndamage they are causing to the seabed below.\nThere is an urgent need for an improved and\ncoordinated scientific focus on identifying and\nmanaging risk to biodiversity and the environment in\nthe deep oceans. We need to broaden our presently\ninadequate knowledge about these unique ocean\nhabitats and ensure that they are managed in a\nsustainable way. Meanwhile, given the risk posed by\npresent practices, we urge the international community\nto impose and observe a moratorium on deep sea\ntrawling.\nDespite the extension in 2001 of the time frame\nset by the parties to the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea for a delimitation of the continental\nshelf, Micronesia and many small island developing\n4\n\nStates face continuing difficulties in meeting our\nobligations in this regard. The problem is a lack of\nfinancial resources and the scientific and technical\nexpertise needed to acquire and collate the highly\ncomplex scientific data. Without targeted assistance\nfrom the donor community, countries like Micronesia\nwill find it extremely difficult to make the required\nsubmission on the limits of the continental shelf, even\nwithin the extended time frame.\nAs neighbours and fellow islanders, we are\nsaddened by the inability of the people of the Republic\nof the Marshall Islands, after almost 50 years, to secure\nfull compensation for the death, sickness and\ndestruction they suffered as a consequence of nuclear\nweapons testing. Recently declassified documents\nmake it clear that the original settlements were not\nbased on the full story of what happened to the\nMarshallese people as well as other peoples of the\nformer Trust Territory. We join other Members in\ncalling upon the United States to meet its responsibility\nin full.\nThis year, Micronesia wishes to again express its\nsupport for United Nations reforms, particularly for the\nreform of the Security Council and the inclusion of our\nneighbour, Japan, among its permanent members. We\nare increasingly concerned over the seeming lack of\nprogress on this critical matter.\nMy final topic is security in the region of the\nPacific. Our President shared with leaders at the\nrecently-concluded annual meeting of the Pacific\nIslands Forum in Apia, Samoa, a common concern that\namidst all the current attention to global security\nissues, the nations of the Pacific islands are being left\nlargely to their own devices in dealing with threats\nrelated to organized crime and terrorism. We are\nworking hard to address our vulnerabilities in these\nareas, but I would like to simply note here that the rest\nof the world, especially the North, is not serving its\nown best interests by giving short shrift to the\npossibilities for criminal and terrorist exploitation that\nare presented by our vast region. Over and above other\ntraditional official development assistance, we need a\nrange of targeted assistance in our region.\nOnce again, it has been our most valued\nopportunity to appear and address the General\nAssembly. The need for this Organization has never\nbeen stronger, and as each year goes by, it seems that\nthe significance and relevance of our Charter increases.\nIn these difficult times, we in Micronesia choose not to\nlose heart, but rather to take heart that we, the nations\nof the world gathered here, can together build not just a\nbetter world, but one that is a worthy inheritance for\nfuture generations."

        "file_text": "This is a momentous\nyear for our country as we celebrate, on 1 October, the\ntenth anniversary of our independence and our\nmembership in this institution. Palau was the last\ncountry to emerge from the Trusteeship System, having\nbeen administered by the United States under the\nsupervision of the United Nations longer than any\ncountry in the world. It was the United Nations that\nprovided Palau with a willing forum in which to\nexpress and ultimately achieve our right to sovereignty,\nand for that we are ever thankful. I am also happy to\nobserve, on this tenth anniversary, that this year we\nestablished, for the first time, a permanent mission in\nNew York so that we can enhance our ability to meet\nour international responsibilities.\nIt was the United States, through its\nadministration and willing cooperation during our\npeaceful emergence into independence, that assured us\nthe liberty and the values that guide us today. For that\nextraordinary legacy, we today express our deep\ngratitude to the United States of America.\nThis is a good year for Palau to deepen its\ninvolvement, since it coincides with the world\u00eds\npreparation for the Mauritius conference and the\nincreased emphasis at the United Nations on the unique\nchallenges facing small island developing States.\nWhile images of swaying palm trees and white sand\nbeaches prevail in the world's imagination, they are\nonly part of the story. In truth and in fact, the\nremoteness and the isolation of Palau make it a very\ndifficult place to develop a self-reliant economy,\nprovide medical care and education to its people and\ndeter aggression and terrorism. Fuel and transportation\nprices are among the highest in the world. After four\nsuccessive colonial administrations, our infrastructure\nis quite incomplete, and our most promising hope for\nthe development of a sustainable economy, our pristine\nenvironment, is threatened by factors beyond our\ncontrol, such as the failure of all industrialized\ncountries to reach agreement on implementing the\nKyoto Protocol.\nWe have created a democratic society and\nensured human rights for our people, but without\ninternational focus, we will not be able to provide hope\nand opportunity to our children, and we will continue\nto watch as they leave their homeland to seek an\neducation and a career elsewhere. For no matter what\nstatistics may be advanced, what references to gross\nnational product may be debated, until we can provide\nour children with the incentive to stay and help build\nour country, we will have lost. Thus, the Mauritius\nprocess is critical for Palau, and we trust that the\ndeveloped countries of the world will embrace it.\n21\n\nSimilarly, we trust that United Nations agencies\nwill sharpen their focus on the small island developing\nStates and correct what we view as a current\nimbalance, in support of the fragile small States of the\nworld. We applaud the recent efforts of the Global\nEnvironmental Facility (GEF) to streamline assistance\nto Palau through the creation of an innovative North\nPacific subregional programme that will build our\ncapacity to protect our environment and create a\nsustainable economy.\nWe are troubled, however, by a growing tendency\nin the donor community to demand that small countries\nlike ours prove our capacity before assistance can be\ndelivered. This is a catch-22 situation that threatens to\nhalt our development. The only way we can build our\ncapacity to execute projects that will save, for example,\nour unique biodiversity is to experience the hard work\nof completing projects and learning from our\nexperience.\nThis observation does not mean that we are\nreluctant to accept the obligations and responsibilities\ninherent in receiving assistance. We are willing and\neager to be monitored by the international community\nin our performance. We firmly believe that we should\nbe held accountable for the quality and the\ntransparency of our efforts.\nIt is ironic that tiny countries such as ours, where\nso many of the world\u00eds environmental treasures exist,\nare denied the assistance they need due to a perceived\nlack of capacity to navigate the unwieldy bureaucracies of\nthe international organizations charged with protecting\nthose very treasures.\nAs already noted, the failure of the world to come\nto agreement on implementing the Kyoto Protocol will\ncontribute to the destruction of our marine and\nterrestrial resources. Palau, like many other small\nisland developing States, is a window on the world\u00eds\nfuture in this regard and must be carefully observed.\nWe urge the GEF to create real funding opportunities\nfor adaptation and mitigation measures in a proactive\nand streamlined fashion before it is too late.\nIn a similar vein, we are increasingly aware of the\nparticularly damaging fishing practice of deep-sea\nbottom trawling. Increasingly employed on the high\nseas as coastal fisheries are depleted, this technique\nentails dragging heavy equipment along the seabed,\ncompletely destroying established coral, sponge and\nrelated communities that have taken centuries to\ndevelop. We are a culture of fishing people and find\nthis practice unacceptable. As we participated with our\nPacific colleagues in eliminating drift-net fishing some\nyears ago, we now call upon the world to join us in\ndeclaring a moratorium on deep sea bottom trawling\nbefore this practice does any more irremediable damage.\nLast month, Palau\u00eds accession to the Group of\nAsian States created the largest regional grouping in\nthe United Nations. Two critical issues involving our\nAsian region also have great global significance.\nFirst, for the United Nations to be effective at\nensuring international peace and security, all nations,\nlarge and small, should be represented in its\ndeliberations. The Republic of China on Taiwan should\nno longer be kept on the sidelines of the most\nimportant international Organization. The principle of\nuniversality should be applied so that the 23 million\npeople of Taiwan can bring their talents, their energy\nand their principled democratic positions to the\norganizations, bodies, specialized agencies and\nprogrammes of the United Nations, thereby aiding the\nrest of the world in pursuing our mutual agenda.\nSecondly, and also in pursuit of the most effective\nmeans to strengthen the credibility of the United\nNations, Palau urges the United Nations to reform the\nSecurity Council to reflect the reality of the\ninternational community in the twenty-first century so\nthat countries that play a major role in the maintenance\nof international peace and security always participate\nin the decision-making process of the Security Council.\nPalau believes that the Security Council should be\nexpanded to include additional developing and\ndeveloped countries as new members, and that Japan\u00eds\nstellar record of contribution is a solid basis for Japan\u00eds\nassumption of permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil. Japan has been a leader in international\ninitiatives for many years, and it is for that reason that\nPalau takes this strongly felt position.\nMuch of my presentation today has focused on\nthe enormous threats to vulnerable island States like\nPalau. We agree with the Secretary-General, who\nobserved in his opening remarks to the high-level\nsegment of the twelfth session of the Commission on\nSustainable Development, held at United Nations\nHeadquarters from 28 to 30 April 2004, that \u00echigh-\nlevel political attention has been diverted from\nsustainable development by the recent emphasis given\nto terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and the war\nin Iraq. But Palau also understands that the scourge of\nglobal terrorism and its immoral violence against\ninnocent people must be defeated. We are proud of our\nsons and daughters serving in the United States\nmilitary. Only last week, one of those sons, a Marine\nfighting side by side with Coalition forces in Iraq, paid\nthe ultimate price, marking the first death of a Palauan\nin the struggle with global terrorism. Our forces are\nsmall in number but, like Corporal Ngirmidol, large in\nloyalty, commitment and idealism. No one should\nmake any mistake about that.\nPalau is grateful to the United States for allowing\nus to achieve our independence and thus to join the\ninternational community\u00eds quest for world peace.\nNonetheless, a balanced international agenda which\nincludes a determined focus on sustainable development\nis required if Palau is to achieve some measure of\neconomic self-reliance, and if the world as we know it\nis to survive."

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir,\non your election as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-ninth session. Your election is a testament to\nthe greatness of our African continent.\nI am pleased to address the Assembly and share\nthe views of my country, Libya, on a number of serious\nand sensitive issues that we deem important for joint\ninternational action and increased universal\ncooperation.\nLast year, we relinquished our right to speak to\nthe President of the African Union in the expectation\nthat he would speak for the entire Union. It seems,\nhowever, that the African Union has no post of Foreign\nMinister and that the Ministers of member States were\ntherefore compelled to speak instead. Thus, I am\nobliged to speak now.\nAll States obviously agree that the current\nstructure and the rules of procedure of the United\n14\n\nNations are flawed, and all States agree on the need for\nreform. Indeed, before we can discuss reform in the\nMiddle East, the former republics of the Soviet Union\nor any other area of the world, we must first reform the\nUnited Nations. Before we speak about lack of\ndemocracy in the world, we must first recognize the\nlack of democracy in the United Nations. Furthermore,\nbecause the General Assembly is the parliament of\nparliaments and the Security Council is the government\nof governments, we have no right to talk about\ndemocracy and reform in the world unless we first\nreform the structure of the United Nations.\nThe past 59 years have demonstrated that the\nGeneral Assembly is merely a decorative body without\na soul and that the authority lies with the Security\nCouncil, which controls all the work of the United\nNations. It is the one and only authority. My country\ntherefore proposes that the upcoming sixtieth session\nof the General Assembly should be decisive and\nimportant, and that invitations should be extended to\nall world leaders to participate. We should announce\nthat decisions on radical reform for the United Nations\nwill be taken at the sixtieth session. God willing,\nPresident Muammar Al-Qadhafi, in what will be his\nfirst visit to the General Assembly, will attend that\nsession, which will be a historic milestone involving a\nconfrontation with the grave and unjust situation\ncurrently prevailing at the United Nations.\nWe propose that the sixtieth session be held in\nGeneva \u2014 the geographical centre of the world \u2014 to\nfacilitate the attendance of all world leaders and\npresidents, even if additional funds have to be\nallocated in order to convene the meeting in Geneva.\nMy country is ready to contribute financial support for\nthat endeavour.\nThere are two options before us. Our first option\nis to transfer the authority to invoke Chapters VI and\nVII of the Charter from the Security Council to the\nGeneral Assembly. If that cannot be done, we have no\nchoice but to declare the General Assembly null and\nvoid and to stop pouring money into this moribund\nbody.\nOur second option is to increase the membership\nof the Security Council by allocating seats to new\nentities such as the African Union, the Association of\nSoutheast Asian Nations and Latin America. In\naddition, the right of veto will have to be reviewed and\nmade subject to new rules at the same time as the\nmembership of the Security Council is expanded.\nWe warn that, unless these reforms are\nimplemented, the United Nations will cease to exist, as\nunilateral actions are taking place outside the confines\nof the United Nations.\nThe African Union must have a permanent seat\non the Security Council. That seat will be held by the\nUnion\u2019s members in rotation.\nAs the sixtieth session of the General Assembly\napproaches, Libya is presenting a unique, bold and\nstrong initiative to eliminate its programmes of\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear and\nchemical weapons, and hand over related equipment to\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\nLibya played the central role in the establishment\nof the African Union and contributed effectively to the\nliberation of colonized and oppressed peoples. Libya,\nwith its 2,000-kilometre coastline along the\nMediterranean Sea, is at the centre of the world and is\nboth a place of conflict and a haven for tourism. The\nMediterranean Sea without Libya is inconceivable, as\nis the south Mediterranean coast without Libya. Libya\ngave birth to the third universal theory \u2014 the middle\nground between capitalism and communism \u2014 and\npresented the world with the Green Book, which\nresolves the political, economic and social problems of\nsociety in its three sections. Accordingly, Libya\ndeserves to have a permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil.\nColonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi presented a\nproposal to world leaders, which they all approved.\nThe proposal calls for the establishment of a committee\nof wise men, consisting of President Nelson Mandela,\nPresident Mikhail Gorbachev and President Bill\nClinton, that would serve as an authority for resolving\nthe conflicts of our world. The United Nations should\nadopt a resolution supporting that proposal.\nWe must all continue to combat terrorism. If we\nwant to eliminate terrorism, we must first eliminate its\ncauses and not simply pursue its isolated operations.\nWe must attack its root causes.\nIf we want oil supplies and prices to remain\nstable, we must prevent wars and potential conflicts\nfrom occurring near oil fields.\n15\n\nFinally, Colonel Al-Qadhafi will soon address the\nissue of United Nations reform on his web site: www.\nalqadhafi.org."

        "file_text": "Through\nForeign Minister Jean Ping of Gabon, I greet the\nrepresentatives of all peoples gathered here today. I\nfraternally salute Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\n5\n\nhas been guiding the work of the United Nations with\nwisdom and devotion.\nFor the second time, I address this universal\nAssembly on behalf of Brazil. I have a lifelong\ncommitment to those silenced by inequality, hunger\nand hopelessness. In the powerful words of Franz\nFanon, the colonial past bestowed on them a common\nlegacy: \u201cIf you so desire, take it: the freedom to starve\nto death\u201d.\nToday, we are 191 nation-States. In the past, 125\nof us were subjected to the oppression of a few Powers\nthat originally occupied less than 2 per cent of the\nglobe. The end of colonialism confirmed, in the\npolitical arena the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination. The Assembly is the highest expression\nof an international order based on the independence of\nnations.\nHowever, such a political transformation has not\ntaken place in the economic and social fields, and\nhistory shows that that will not happen spontaneously.\nIn 1820, the per capita income of the richest nation in\nthe world was five times greater than that of the\npoorest one. Today, that disparity has reached a ratio of\n80-to-1.\nThe former subjects have become perpetual\ndebtors in the international economic system.\nProtectionist barriers and other obstacles to balanced\ntrade \u2014 aggravated by the concentration of\ninvestments, knowledge and technology \u2014 have\nfollowed colonial domination. A powerful, all-\nencompassing and invisible wheel runs the system\nfrom afar. It often revokes democratic decisions, causes\nthe sovereignty of States to shrivel and imposes itself\non elected Governments. It demands that legitimate\nnational development projects be renounced. The\nperverse logic of draining the needy to irrigate the\naffluent still stands. In recent decades, an ill-inclusive\nand asymmetric globalization has deepened the\ndevastating legacy of poverty and social regression,\nwhich is now bursting into the agenda of the twenty-\nfirst century. Today, in 54 countries, per capita income\nis lower than what it was 10 years ago; in 34 countries,\nlife expectancy has decreased; and in 14 countries, a\ngreater number of children are starving to death.\nIn Africa, where colonialism resisted until the\ntwilight of the twentieth century, 200 million people\nare caught in an existence marked by hunger, disease\nand neglect, to which the world has become oblivious,\nnumbed by the routine of the distant suffering of\nothers. Lack of basic sanitation has killed more\nchildren in the past decade than all military conflicts\nsince the end of the Second World War.\nLove cannot spring from cruelty. Peace will never\nrise from poverty and hunger. The hatred and\nsenselessness that are spreading throughout the world\nfeed on despair and on the absolute lack of hope for\nmany people.\nThis year alone, more than 1,700 people have\ndied as a consequence of terrorist attacks around the\nworld \u2014 in Madrid, Baghdad and Jakarta. Those\ntragedies must be added to so many others in India, the\nMiddle East and the United States, as well as to, more\nrecently, the barbaric slaughter of children in Beslan.\nMankind is losing the fight for peace. Only the\nenlightened values of humanism, applied with clarity\nof mind and determination, will be able to counter\nbarbarism.\nThis situation imposes a new sense of collective\nand individual responsibility on the peoples and the\nleaders of the world. If peace is our goal, it is our task\nto build it. If we wish to eliminate violence, we must\naddress its deep-rooted origins with the same resolve\nemployed against the agents of hatred. The path to\nlasting peace must encompass a new international\npolitical and economic order, one that extends real\nopportunities for economic and social development to\nall countries. It therefore requires reform of the global\ndevelopment model, as well as international\ninstitutions that are effectively democratic and based\non multilateralism and on an acknowledgement of the\nrights and aspirations of all peoples.\nThe tortured look in the eyes of the outcast\nshould do more to stir our conscience than the no less\ndramatic statistics on social inequality. Their gaze calls\nto us for a future of hope. Just as our destinies are now\nintertwined, every conflict has global effects. When the\nsky is shown to us from between iron bars, let us not\nmistake the cage for freedom.\nWe have the scientific knowledge and the scale of\nproduction necessary for resolving global economic\nand social challenges. Today, nature and progress can\nbe reconciled by means of development models that are\nethically and environmentally sustainable. Nature is\nnot a museum of untouchable relics, but neither should\nit be further degraded by human and environmental\nexploitation in a search for wealth at any price.\n6\n\nA generation is remembered not only for what it\naccomplishes, but also for what it fails to accomplish.\nIf our resources are so much greater than our\nachievements, how will we explain to future\ngenerations why we did so little when so much was\nwithin our reach? A neglectful civilization is\ncondemned to wither like a body without a soul.\nThe exhortations from the great New Deal leader\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt still resonate with\ninescapable pertinence. What is needed today is \u201cbold,\npersistent experimentation\u201d. \u201cThe only thing we need\nto fear is fear itself.\u201d Such boldness stems not from\ninstinct, but rather from political courage; not from\nirresponsible wilfulness, but rather from a daring\nability to reform. What sets civilization apart from\nbarbarism is a political architecture that promotes\npeaceful change and advances social and economic life\nby means of democratic consensus. If we fail against\nhunger and poverty, what else will be able to bring us\ntogether?\nI believe the time has come to state clearly that\nfor us to once again grow in a fair way, an important\nshift in the financial flows from international\nmultilateral organizations is necessary. Such\norganizations were created to provide solutions, but, by\nadopting excessive rigour, they themselves have\nsometimes become part of the problem. They must\nadjust their focus on development, thus restoring their\noriginal objectives. The International Monetary Fund\nshould be able to provide the guarantees and\nthe liquidity that are necessary for productive\ninvestments \u2014 especially in infrastructure, housing\nand sanitation \u2014 and which can also restore poor\ncountries\u2019 capacity to pay.\nBrazilian foreign policy, in all its dimensions, is\nfocused on joining other nations in efforts aimed at the\nestablishment of a world of justice and peace.\nYesterday, in a historic meeting, more than 60 world\nleaders gathered to give new impetus to international\naction against hunger and poverty. I firmly believe that\nthe process launched yesterday will bring the fight\nagainst world poverty to a new level. As we advance in\nthis new alliance, we shall have better means to attain\nthe Millennium Development Goals, especially with\nregard to the eradication of hunger.\nIt was in this same spirit of contributing to the\nreduction of poverty that Brazil, India and South Africa\nestablished, last year, the India-Brazil-South Africa\n(IBSA) Fund. Our first project, in Guinea-Bissau, will\nbe launched tomorrow.\nHIV/AIDS and its nefarious connection to hunger\nand poverty is also a priority. Our international\ncooperation programme with other developing\ncountries in fighting HIV/AIDS is now operating in six\ndeveloping countries and will soon be extended to\nanother three.\nI am fully aware of the serious security problems\nthat pose a threat to international stability. There seems\nto be no prospect for improvement in the critical\nsituation in the Middle East. In that and other conflicts,\nthe international community cannot allow violence \u2014\nwhether sponsored by States or by other actors \u2014 to\nprevail over democratic dialogue. The Palestinian\npeople are still far from achieving the self-\ndetermination to which they are entitled.\nWe know that the underlying causes of insecurity\nare complex. The necessary fight against terrorism\ncannot be conceived strictly in military terms. We must\ndevelop strategies that encompass both solidarity and\nfirmness, but with strict respect for international law.\nOn that basis, Brazil and other Latin American\ncountries have responded to the call of the United\nNations and are engaged in the stabilization efforts in\nHaiti. If we seek new paradigms in international\nrelations, we cannot shirk our responsibility to address\nthe concrete situations that emerge.\nThe promotion of equitable development is\ncrucial to addressing the centuries-old causes of\nHaitian instability. In our region, despite grave social\nand economic problems, a culture of peace prevails.\nOur continent is experiencing a period of democratic\ncoming of age, with a vibrant civil society. We have\nlearned that development and social justice must be\nsought with determination and an openness to dialogue.\nThe bouts of instability in our region have been dealt\nwith while strictly respecting our institutions.\nWhenever requested, and within its means and\ncapabilities, Brazil has made its contribution to help\nfriendly countries overcome crises that threatened their\nconstitutional order and stability. We do not believe in\ninterfering in the domestic affairs of other countries,\nbut neither can we condone omission and indifference\nin the face of situations that affect our neighbours.\nBrazil is committed to the establishment of a\nSouth America that is politically stable, prosperous and\nunited, on the basis of strengthening the South\n7\n\nAmerican Common Market (MERCOSUR) and its\nstrategic relationship with Argentina. The possibility\nthat a community of South American States could\nemerge is no longer a distant dream, thanks to decisive\ninitiatives in the areas of structural, economic,\ncommercial, social and cultural integration.\nBrazil is at work in multilateral negotiations with\na view to reaching just and equitable agreements. At\nthe last meeting of the World Trade Organization, we\ntook a fundamental step towards the elimination of\nabusive restrictions that hamper developing countries.\nCoordination among countries from Africa, Asia and\nLatin America in the Group of 20 was decisive for\nkeeping the Doha Round on the right track of trade\nliberalization with social justice. If successful, the\nDoha Round could lift more than 500 million people\nout of poverty. It is essential to carry on building a new\nworld economic and commercial geography that, while\nmaintaining the vital ties to developed countries,\nallows for the establishment of solid bridges among the\ncountries of the South, which have remained isolated\nfrom one another for too long.\nBrazil is committed to the success of the\ninternational climate change regime. We are\ndeveloping renewable sources of energy. That is why\nwe shall continue to actively strive for the entry into\nforce of the Kyoto Protocol.\nSouth America contains approximately 50 per\ncent of the world\u2019s biodiversity. We stand for\ncombating bio-piracy as well as for the negotiation of\nan international regime for sharing the benefits derived\nfrom the use of genetic resources and traditional\nknowledge.\nI reiterate what I stated at this very rostrum last\nyear: only an international order based on\nmultilateralism can promote peace and the sustainable\ndevelopment of nations. Such an order must be based\non a constructive dialogue among different cultures\nand world visions. No organ is better suited than the\nUnited Nations to ensure the world\u2019s convergence\naround common goals. The Security Council is the\nonly source of legitimate action in the field of\ninternational peace and security, but its composition\nmust reflect today\u2019s reality \u2014 not perpetuate the post-\nWorld-War-II era or the Cold War era. Reform\nproposals that simply dress the current structure in new\nclothes and do not provide for an increase in the\nnumber of permanent members are manifestly\ninsufficient. The difficulties inherent to any reform\nprocess must not cause us to lose sight of its urgency.\nThere will be neither security nor stability in the\nworld until a more just and democratic order is\nestablished. The community of nations must give a\nclear and urgent response to this challenge. We can\nfind such a response in the wise words of the Prophet\nIsaiah: the fruit of righteousness will be peace."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me today to\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session,\non behalf of the Government of Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez and\nof the people of the Dominican Republic, in this forum\ndevoted to the maintenance of peace and the promotion\nof development and harmony among peoples. Once\nagain, we are speaking out on the most delicate and\nimportant issues on the international agenda so that we\ncan join forces in the search for viable solutions to the\nproblems that affect us all.\nI extend my sincerest congratulations to you, Sir,\non your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. We are confident\nthat you will steer our work along the path of peace\nand security for the good of mankind. We also\nunderscore the important work accomplished by the\noutgoing President, Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia.\nThe Dominican Republic has been struck by a\nforce of nature that has left death and destruction in its\nwake in various parts of the country. The rain and the\nwind of Hurricane Jeanne had severe consequences for\nthe eastern part of our country, destroying homes,\nmeans of communication, bridges, crops and tourist\ninfrastructure, at a time when the Dominican Republic\nhad been making increasing efforts to jumpstart its\neconomy. We take this opportunity to express our\nthanks for the international community\u2019s solidarity in\nthese difficult times for the Dominican Republic. I\nwould also like to express my deepest thanks to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who has expressed\nsolidarity with our country and with Haiti in the\ncontext of this natural disaster.\nThe fact of globalization steadily deepens\nrelations among our countries, challenging our capacity\nto take advantage of the opportunities that\nglobalization offers, as well as our capacity to limit its\nnegative impact. Together with the contradictory and\ncomplex processes of integration and disintegration,\nour countries still hope that the benefits of\nglobalization will create conditions making it possible\nto overcome poverty and attain a good life.\nA tragic event that occurred in this city of New\nYork on 11 September 2001 changed the destiny of\nhumankind in a matter of minutes, and made the world\nincreasingly dangerous and insecure. The promise of\nlasting peace presaged by the end of the cold war was\ndestroyed by terrorist actions \u2014 actions which were\ncondemned by all humankind and which have\nunleashed a steady escalation of violence that has\nturned the world into a place of uncertainty.\nWe must spare no effort to rid humankind of the\nthreat of terrorism. We condemn terrorist acts in all\n14\n\ntheir forms and manifestations, whatever their source\nand whomever may be affected, and want to\nunderscore the importance of international cooperation\nin the fight against that scourge, which should always\nbe prosecuted in strict compliance with international\nlaw, and, in particular, with human rights and\ninternational humanitarian law.\nThe Dominican Republic is founded on an\nunconditional commitment to the norms and principles\nof international law, and particularly those that relate to\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, the condemnation\nof the use of force, compliance in good faith with\ninternational treaties and the implementation of the\nresolutions of the United Nations and its deliberative\nbodies, including the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Commission on Human Rights.\nWe reaffirm the view to which countries\ncommitted themselves in May 2004 at the third\nSummit Conference of Heads of State and Government\nof Latin America and the Caribbean and of the\nEuropean Union, as set out in paragraph 8 of the\nDeclaration of Guadalajara:\n\u201c[A]n effective multilateral system, based on\ninternational law, supported by strong\ninternational institutions and with the United\nNations at its centre, is essential for achieving\npeace and international security, sustainable\ndevelopment and social progress.\u201d\nHowever, in order to achieve those objectives we\nmust streamline, modernize and reform the entire\nmultilateral international system, a process that States\nmust support through respect for and compliance with\nthe resolutions adopted, without neglecting genuine\nand effective equitable regional participation.\nMultilateralism is one of the main pillars of the\nforeign policy of the Dominican Republic, as can be\nseen by our participation and cooperation in all\ninternational forums. For that reason, we join those\nnations that call for a thorough reform of the United\nNations system, with a view to enhancing its\ndemocratization and making it a more effective\ninstrument for States Members. That reform must be\ngeared, first of all, towards strengthening the General\nAssembly, the most important body of the\nOrganization, and the Security Council, in which there\nis unequal geographical representation. We reiterate yet\nagain the suggestion that has been made for several\nyears now: the Security Council should be expanded so\nthat Asia, Africa and Latin America can have two\npermanent members, and the number of non-permanent\nseats should be increased in order to democraticize the\ndecision-making mechanism of that forum for peace.\nThose reforms are necessary to make the multilateral\nsystem more agile and effective, so that it may more\nsuccessfully confront global threats and challenges.\nI would like to echo the commitment undertaken\nby the heads of State or Government who met in Santo\nDomingo in August and adopted the Declaration of\nSanto Domingo 2004, in which we agreed that:\n\u201c[t]he fight against poverty is essential to the\nconsolidation of democracy. In that regard, it is\nnecessary to formulate and implement public\npolicies aimed at strengthening economic growth\nand an equitable distribution of national income\nand wealth.\u201d\nAs we are all aware, the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) has reported that the richest 20\nper cent of Latin America\u2019s population receives 54 per\ncent of national income, whereas the poorest 20 per\ncent of population receives only four per cent. This fact\nis an attack on governability.\nWe want to underscore the importance of a\nmeeting that was held at the United Nations last\nweek \u2014 the gathering of world leaders in an alliance\nagainst hunger and poverty, which resulted in a serious\ncommitment on the part of each and every one of our\nrepresentatives here to fight unwaveringly and\neffectively to achieve the agreed objectives.\nFor the Government of the Dominican Republic,\nthe fight against corruption is a priority. We have\nshown this by implementing mechanisms to prevent\nand punish acts of corruption. That scourge has a grave\nimpact on the economies of our countries. We all know\nthat the main victims of corruption are the poor. We\nneed, above all, to strengthen existing mechanisms,\nand to produce others if necessary, in order to wage a\npitched battle against corruption and those who benefit\nfrom it, regardless of their origin or social class. We\nhave taken this decision because we see that the rise in\ncorruption in our region has jeopardized the\ngovernability of all of our countries. Governmental\ntransparency and a greater participation of civil society\nare necessary to combat this evil.\nWe wish to emphasize this morning the\nimportance and effectiveness of the follow-up\n15\n\nmechanism for the implementation of the Inter-\nAmerican Convention Against Corruption, and its Plan\nof Action adopted in Managua. Likewise, we ask that\nour countries not be used as safe havens for persons\nconvicted of acts of corruption. We also advocate the\nreturn of those ill-gotten gains to the countries that\nhave fallen victim to this evil, which, together with\ndrug trafficking, has a negative impact on the stability\nof democracy and the enforcement of the rule of law.\nIn recent years, Dominican Republic has made\nreal progress in its struggle against trafficking in\npersons, where the most vulnerable populations are\nwomen and children, whether at the regional or\ninternational level. Through the establishment of\nnational and international networks against trafficking\nin Dominican children and adolescents, and with the\ncooperation of the diplomatic foreign and consular\nservices, we have made great strides in that area. We\ntake this opportunity to emphasize the participation of\nthe International Organization for Migration and its\nimportant support in this struggle.\nAs for the struggle of countries against the\nmanufacture and illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons, our country is committed to assisting in the\nareas of investigation and the adoption of measures for\nstrengthening global and regional cooperation in order\nto fight against this scourge. States must continue to\nmake every effort to implement the Programme of\nAction adopted by the United Nations Conference on\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\nAll Its Aspects.\nWe also want to express our deep concern at the\nhigh level of kidnappings and crime in our countries \u2014\na level that increases year after year, thus worsening\nthe sense of insecurity felt by persons of all social\nclasses and races. The rise in crime is a threat to the\nsecurity and safety of our citizens and to the\ndemocratic governability of all of our countries. Well-\ndesigned deterrence mechanisms based on zero\ntolerance, an efficient police force, and a strengthened\njudiciary will all be necessary to reduce this scourge,\nwhich has a significant impact on the lives of our\ncitizens.\nOn a different topic, the Caribbean now has the\nsecond highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world.\nWe invite the Member States of the United Nations to\nrededicate themselves to the terms of the Declaration\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at the special\nsession of the General Assembly on 27 June 2001.\nDominican legislation includes law 55-93 on\nHIV/AIDS, which is now in the process of being\nreformed and which represents one of the few existing\npieces of legislation in our region regarding that\ndisease. We reiterate the request for cooperation to the\ninternational community so that, through financing, the\ncountries most seriously affected can have more\nresources to deal with the consequences of that illness\nin order to provide the comprehensive care that is very\nnecessary, as well as the antiretroviral medications to\ncombat the illness. This is based on the right of all\ncitizens to life and health.\nIn recent years and in most international forums,\nour country has referred to the grave crisis confronting\nthe sister republic of Haiti. We have drawn attention to\nthe fact that the Dominican Republic could not and\ncannot bear the weight of this crisis and its\nconsequences on its shoulders alone. On more than one\noccasion we have called on the international\ncommunity for solidarity. We do so with the intent of\nbeginning a far-reaching process that can help in\nfinding a solution to this problem. Today, we see that\novercoming this crisis represents a major challenge to\nthe United Nations, and therefore we support the\nprocess that began through the United Nations\nStabilization Mission in Haiti. We consider it very\nimportant that the Haitian people see this peaceful\nmission as the participation of the international\ncommunity in the stabilization of their nation, and that\nthey at no time view it as an occupation force.\nHurricane Jeanne has caused thousands of deaths\nand much destruction in the area of Gona\u00efves, Haiti,\nthus deepening the economic and humanitarian crisis in\nthat country. Now, more than ever, we call on the\ninternational community and international financial\nbodies to provide the necessary financial resources that\ncan place that nation on the path toward stability and\nprogress.\nMany regions of the world have not yet achieved\nthe peace to which they aspire. Despite all the efforts\nundertaken in that regard, innocent people continue to\nlose their lives in a conflict that for decades has\ncharacterized the instability of the Middle East.\nThe Dominican Republic avails itself of this\nforum to reaffirm its unrestricted support for the peace\nprocess begun between Israel and Palestine during the\n16\n\n1991 Madrid Conference, for the Oslo Agreements, for\nthe recommendations made by United States Senator\nGeorge Mitchell in his final report and for the road\nmap presented by President George Bush and\nsupported by Russia and the European Union.\nFinally, the Dominican Republic reiterates its\nposition, expressed in various forums, on the need for a\nconstructive dialogue between the nations located on\nboth sides of the Straits of Taiwan in order to ensure\npeace and security in that region.\nI conclude by expressing the hope that this\noccasion has enabled the Governments represented at\nthis meeting to reflect seriously on our destiny \u2014 the\ndestiny of all men and women who live on Earth \u2014\nand also that the United Nations will be able, with the\ncooperation of States, to establish the balance\nnecessary for the benefit of international peace and\nsecurity."

        "file_text": "Allow me to extend to\nyou warm congratulations on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I\nwould like to assure you of our fullest cooperation as\nyou discharge the heavy responsibility bestowed upon\nyou. I have no doubt that both Gabon and Africa will\nbe proud of the leadership that I know you will provide\nat this session.\nI would also like to commend your predecessor\nfor his invaluable contribution to the success of the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nWe continue to be deeply grateful to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the great work\nthat he has been doing in a variety of areas and at\nvarious levels. We are grateful to him for doing\nwhatever is humanly possible at the international level\nto protect the integrity of the United Nations and to\ndefend the rule of law. At the level of Africa, we\nappreciate his commitment to the creation of the\npolitical and economic conditions to generate hope for\nthe revival of the continent.\nNever before have we in Africa been as\ndetermined and as resolute in our attempt to change for\nthe better the economic and social conditions on our\ncontinent and to create the right climate for peace and\nstability.\nThat is what the transformation of the\nOrganization of African Unity into the African Union\n(AU) signifies and what the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD) symbolizes. NEPAD\u2019s\nPeer Review Mechanism is a vivid demonstration of\nAfrica\u2019s commitment to good and accountable\ngovernance.\nThe renewed vigour with which we in Africa\nhave begun to be proactive in the area of peace and\nstability within the framework of the Peace and\nSecurity Council of the AU is, indeed, a promising\nbeginning. But despite the efforts being made by\nAfrica, the progress that we have made so far has been\nmodest and thus insufficient to bring about hope for the\nfuture of the continent.\nPart of the explanation for that is obvious. There\nis just not sufficient support internationally to make it\npossible for Africa to meet the economic challenges\nthat it is facing. Terms of trade have continued to\nmilitate against Africa\u2019s development. Moreover, no\nsubstantial progress has been made to relieve many in\nAfrica of the debt burden.\nIt is the combination of all of those factors that\nhas created serious doubts about the ability of many in\nAfrica to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nIt is our hope that those trends will be reversed and that\nthe promises made in the Millennium Declaration\nfulfilled.\nAt the end of the day, nations must assume\nresponsibility for their future, for their development\nand for their peace and stability. Ethiopia has no\nillusions in that regard. We realize fully that, in the\nfinal analysis, it is what Ethiopians do that will shape\nand determine our future. It is that conviction that is\nthe basis for the various activities currently under way\nin our country.\nWith respect to issues of development, the\nprimary task for us is the fight against poverty and\nensuring food security for our people. A nation as\ndiverse as Ethiopia can countenance no other form of\ngovernance than democratic governance. As such, the\nvery survival of Ethiopia requires good governance and\nthe democratic handling of differences, as a matter not\nonly of preference but of prudence. Peace and stability\n19\n\nin Ethiopia hinge on the deepening of democracy in the\ncountry.\nIt is precisely for that reason, and with a view to\nmaking up for lost time, that at present there is no\ngreater imperative for Ethiopia than the fostering of\npeace and stability in our country and in the region of\nwhich Ethiopia is a part.\nIt is that same logic which governs Ethiopia\u2019s\nposition on the peace process between Ethiopia and\nEritrea. Let there be no doubt that Ethiopia wants to\nput its crisis with Eritrea behind it. Our conviction is\nthat both peoples would be mistaken to see the other as\nan enemy. The truth is that both have one common\nenemy \u2014 poverty and backwardness.\nIt is, indeed, regrettable that after so much\nbloodshed it has become difficult for Ethiopia and\nEritrea to formally complete the peace process because\nof complications that have been created in connection\nwith the implementation of some aspects of the\ndecision of the Eritrea/Ethiopia Boundary Commission\n(EEBC). I said, \u201csome aspects of the decision\u201d of the\nEEBC because, when the chips are down, the obstacles\nto a breakthrough in the peace process between\nEthiopia and Eritrea involve a controversy surrounding\nthe demarcation of no more than 15 per cent of a\ncommon boundary which is, altogether, more than\n1,000 kilometres long.\nLet me be very clear. Ethiopia is prepared to do\nwhatever is humanly possible for peace. There is no\ngreater priority for us than ensuring peace in our\ncountry and stable and mutually beneficial relations\nwith all our neighbours. That is precisely why we have\nreiterated that we are ready to dialogue with Eritrea\nwith a view to finding a win-win solution to the current\nstalemate faced by both countries.\nDialogue and normalization of relations between\nthe two countries is not a favour that either party does\nfor the other, or for the international community.\nRather, it is an obligation that both countries have,\ninasmuch as all other alternatives are ruled out by\ninternational law and by the Algiers Agreement.\nThe promotion of durable peace between the two\ncountries and the call for the permanent cessation of\nmilitary hostilities between the two parties are the twin\npillars of the Algiers Agreement. Ethiopia is convinced\nthat the implementation of some aspects of the\nBoundary Commission\u2019s observations on demarcation\nis not in the interest of peace between the two countries\nand will not advance the major objectives of the\nAlgiers Agreement, nor will it advance the cause of\npeace in our subregion.\nIt is under those circumstances that Ethiopia has\nfelt that there is only one rational way out of the\nimpasse \u2014 dialogue, an open-ended dialogue on all\nissues dividing Ethiopia and Eritrea, including on\nboundary demarcation with a view to finding an\namicable and a mutually acceptable way out of the\ndeadlock and a modus vivendi that would form the\nbasis for the normalization of relations between the\ntwo countries.\nEritrea, however, is of a different mind. It\ncontinues to be preoccupied with the hope of getting\nthe Security Council to impose sanctions on Ethiopia\nand with the satisfaction that it would derive from such\nan outcome. Eritrea should be made to realize that that\nis unlikely to happen. Not because Eritrea is not big\nenough to have its way, but because the idea is too\ninappropriate and too unrealistic. Formality aside \u2014\nand Eritrea\u2019s oft-heard refrain of \u201cfinal and binding\u201d\nnotwithstanding \u2014 no fair-minded person can forget\nwhat happened in May 1998 and up through May 2000,\nand what the OAU said about Badme and its environs.\nBut talking about the past is not going to help\nEthiopia or Eritrea. The two countries cannot continue\nspending so much time on their preoccupation with\neach other. That will leave no time for thinking about\ntheir future and the future of their hungry and destitute\npeoples.\nThere is one other important point that Eritrea\nshould not be allowed to continue misleading the\ninternational community about. Nowhere in the whole\ntext of the Algiers Agreement of December 2000 is a\nprovision made for any entity \u2014 including the Security\nCouncil and the AU \u2014 to enforce a court decision.\nThat omission is deliberate, not accidental. Achieving\npeace and implementing the demarcation of the\ncommon boundary between the two countries is\nprimarily the responsibility of Ethiopia and Eritrea, a\npoint that has been repeated in various resolutions by\nthe Security Council.\nLet me close the issue by reiterating one\nfundamental point. Ethiopia is committed to peace with\nEritrea and to the removal of obstacles to achieving\nthat objective. Whatever means might be available to\nreach that goal, we will be ready to embrace them.\n20\n\nDialogue and negotiation, including using the good\noffices of the Secretary-General which have been made\navailable to the two parties, are the most realistic and\nfeasible means for making progress in the peace\nprocess. Ethiopia is ready to go more than half way to\nmake that a reality, but so far it has largely been left in\nthe proverbial situation of trying to clap with one hand.\nIt is our hope that reason will prevail in Eritrea sooner\nrather than later.\nThe peace process in Somalia has now come to a\nvery critical point, with the Somalis having now come\ncloser than any time in the last 13 years to establishing\na national Government. Ethiopia will continue, as a\nmember of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment Facilitation Committee, to contribute to\nthe achievement of national reconciliation and work to\nhelp the Somali State rise from the ashes. That is an\nobligation for Ethiopia and it is also consistent with the\nvital interest Ethiopia has in peace and stability in our\nsubregion.\nFor those reasons, Ethiopia was looking forward\nto the final consummation of the peace process\nbetween the Government of the Sudan and the\nSudanese People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Sudanese\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA), which has\nnow slowed down because of the tragedy in Darfur \u2014\nan unanticipated tragedy. Ethiopia is keen to see the\nDarfur crisis resolved and the humanitarian tragedy\ndealt with as speedily as possible. Peace and stability\nin the Sudan is so critical for our subregion and for that\nreason Ethiopia will continue to do the best it can,\nincluding as a member of the AU Peace and Security\nCouncil, to assist that sister country to overcome the\nchallenge it is facing.\nEthiopia\u2019s contribution to peace and peace-\nbuilding is not limited to what we have been doing in\nour own subregion. We have from the outset been\nclosely associated with the prevention, management\nand resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes region,\nincluding at the highest level. Moreover, initially as\npart of the African Union mission and later as part of\nthe United Nations Operation in Burundi, Ethiopia\u2019s\ncontingent in Burundi has continued to contribute in a\nmodest way to the success of the peace process there.\nAnother modest contribution we are making is in\njoining the efforts under way for the restoration of\npeace in Liberia as part of the United Nations Mission\nin Liberia.\nCertainly, we are also the beneficiaries of the\nsupport of a great many countries through the United\nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE),\nwhose work has been critical for keeping the situation\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea stable. We are indeed\ngrateful to UNMEE, its personnel at all levels, and to\nthe troop-contributing countries.\nWe all agree that terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations is a crime against humanity. As our\nSecretary-General rightly stated in his address to this\nAssembly at the 3rd meeting, \u201cNo cause, no grievance,\nhowever legitimate in itself, can begin to justify such\nacts\u201d. The international community should therefore\nfight that scourge with greater resolve and in unison.\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming\nEthiopia\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and to\nthe principles and purposes for the promotion of which\nit was created. It is our earnest hope that the United\nNations will continue to enhance its credibility with\nrespect to its entire membership. That is why the\nreform of the Organization is so critical and\nimperative, including the reform of the Security\nCouncil, so that regions, including Africa, can have the\nfair representation they aspire to. Without a doubt,\nenhanced democratization will make the United\nNations more transparent and therefore more credible.\nThe future of the Organization rests on it. In the\nmeantime, Ethiopia will continue to be devoted to the\nUnited Nations and to the values it stands for."

        "file_text": "The General Assembly,\nthis most democratic and representative of United\nNations organs, has served for almost six decades now\nas a forum in which all States, no matter their size or\nstatus, may address with equal voice issues of interest\nand concern to them as well as to the international\ncommunity. It has indeed become the parliament of\nhumankind.\nTo the President of the General Assembly, a\ndistinguished son of Africa, now falls the task of\nguiding the deliberations of this fifty-ninth session. I\nwould like to offer him my delegation\u2019s warm\ncongratulations and good wishes as he assumes his\nhigh responsibilities.\nI would like to extend to the outgoing President,\nThe Honourable Julian Hunte, our appreciation and\nthanks for his magisterial direction of the Assembly\u2019s\nactivities over the past year. His performance is a\nsource of pride and satisfaction, not only to his native\nSaint Lucia, but also to the wider Caribbean\ncommunity, to which both our countries belong. Allow\nme also to convey to the Secretary-General, Kofi\nAnnan, our gratitude for his sure and steady leadership\nof the Organization during these tumultuous times.\nThe speakers who have preceded me in the debate\nhave all expressed their preoccupation at the rising\nlevel of threat to global peace and security, as well as\nto our common economic and social security. Intense\nconflict in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq and\nelsewhere in the Middle East, Africa and Europe has\ndestroyed thousands of innocent lives and wreaked\nhavoc on the States involved. At the same time, despite\nthe many promises of globalization, development\ncontinues to elude the majority of countries, especially\nthe poorest and most vulnerable. The HIV/AIDS\npandemic has not abated, continuously robbing us of\nprecious human and financial resources. Altogether,\nthe international scenario facing us is distressing,\noffering scant hope for early improvement. Like others,\ntherefore, my delegation cannot help but state its\nconcern at the ever-worsening international climate.\nWhile most of our problems are man-made, many\nof our States, such as those in the Caribbean, must also\nface the constant threat of natural disasters. The recent\nwave of hurricanes that destroyed our sister State of\nGrenada and severely battered other island countries,\nsuch as Haiti, the Bahamas, Cuba, the Cayman Islands,\nthe Dominican Republic and Jamaica, has shown how\ndestructive the forces of nature can be to our\ndevelopment. The Government of Guyana extends its\nsolidarity and support to all those afflicted, as well as\nto the United States of America, whose state of Florida\nhas also been seriously struck. Such is the frequency of\nthese phenomena that the international community\nmust now seek to devise stronger and more responsive\nmachinery to address their consequences. In this\nregard, Guyana attaches high importance to the\noutcome, next January, of the International Meeting to\nReview the Implementation of the Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States, which will be held in\nMauritius, and the World Conference on Disaster\nReduction, in Kobe, Japan.\nThe scourge of terrorism has now reached such a\nscale that it has been aptly described as a third world\nwar. Scarce resources must now be diverted from\ndevelopment to the war on terror. Yet the rampage of\ndestruction continues unrestrained. The process under\nway to stem the illicit global trade in small arms and\nlight weapons and to forge more effective international\ninstruments against terrorism and transnational crime\ncommands Guyana\u2019s full support. We anxiously await\nthe report of the United Nations High-level Panel on\n7\n\nThreats, Challenges and Change, in the hope that it will\noffer practical recommendations for preserving global\npeace and stability. The time may have come, we\nbelieve, to fully implement the collective security\nsystem that is envisaged in the United Nations Charter.\nThe age of globalization and liberalization in\nwhich we now live has undoubtedly brought with it\nlaissez-faire attitudes and policies that have seriously\naffected societies everywhere. Lawlessness and\nviolence are the new order of the day, threatening to\ndestroy established systems of governance, especially\nin weak States, as demonstrated by the recent\ninterruption of the democratic process in Haiti, the\nnewest member of our Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM), which has exacerbated social conditions\nin that country. The Inter-American Democratic\nCharter and, indeed, our own Charter of Civil Society\nfor the Caribbean Community expressly condemn such\nbreaches of democracy. Notwithstanding our concern at\nthese developments, Guyana stands ready to help the\nfraternal people of Haiti overcome their social distress.\nCARICOM, of which both Guyana and Haiti are\nmembers, is currently coordinating our humanitarian\nassistance to the island.\nRespect for the fundamental tenets of the United\nNations is essential if we are to avoid conflicts. The\nCharter is clear in its proscription of the use of force\nexcept under the particular circumstances of Chapter\nVII. In this context, let me say that Guyana supports\nthe reform of the Security Council through an\nexpansion in the membership of both the permanent\nand non-permanent categories and a general\nimprovement of its modus operandi. After careful\ndeliberation and in an attempt to break the current\nlogjam in the discussions, my Government has decided\nat this stage to support the aspirations of Brazil, India\nand an African State to permanent membership. We\nbelieve that their participation as developing States in\nthe work of the Council will make that body more\nbalanced, representative and, ultimately, more\naccountable to the Assembly for the maintenance of\nglobal peace and security.\nFor Guyana, as for the rest of the international\ncommunity, the situation in Iraq continues to be a\nsource of preoccupation. We would wish to see peace\nand stability quickly restored to that country and its\npeople. Similarly, we urge an end to the suicidal\nconflict between Israel and Palestine and a return to\nnegotiations leading to the creation of an independent\nPalestine and peaceful co-existence between the two\nStates.\nAs conflicts and humanitarian crises such as the\none in Darfur continue to multiply, the United Nations\nis being called to do more with less. We therefore call\nfor the strengthening of regional arrangements, such as\nthose of the Organization of American States and the\nAfrican Union, acting in concert with the United\nNations, to assist in the search for durable solutions to\nconflicts and disputes.\nIt is also imperative that we strive with greater\ndetermination to secure our economic development and\nsocial progress. For more than six decades now, the\ninternational community has diligently sought answers\nto the development dilemma, moving from one facet to\nanother, from disarmament to basic needs, from\neconomic growth to full employment, from partnership\nto national ownership and from good governance to the\nfree market. Thus far, however, the various models of\ndevelopment followed have failed to achieve their\ngoals. In the continuing exploration, this year\u2019s Human\nDevelopment Report has added culture to the list of\ncrucial elements. As a small, multi-ethnic State,\nGuyana fully accepts this proposition and is committed\nto preserving the culture that has brought our nation\ntogether in service to our national development.\nAt the same time, we believe that cultural\ndiversity is a contemporary reality and must be\nrecognized by all States. Too often, strategies for peace\nand development ignore this reality with disastrous\nresults. Not enough consultation and coordination are\nundertaken to ensure that programmes and projects are\nin keeping with nationally defined priorities and local\ncircumstances. It is necessary, if failure is to be\navoided, for there to be greater dialogue and\ncooperation in the planning process for development.\nNational leadership remains a sine qua non for\nsuccessful development and must be strongly\nsupported by our development partners. In this spirit,\nGuyana renews its support for the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD) and other such\ninitiatives based on strong national leadership and full\ninternational cooperation.\nPresident Lula of Brazil and the World\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization\nare to be commended for calling this Assembly\u2019s\nattention to two major challenges facing the\ninternational community today, namely, poverty and\n8\n\nthe inequities of globalization. Although we daily see\non our television screens the emaciated faces of the\nhungry, we are yet to be stirred with the compassion\nand generosity of heart needed to relieve their misery.\nAs globalization gains further ground, many more will\nfall victim to further marginalization, especially in\nsmall developing countries that are unable to take\nadvantage of globalization. My own country has\nrecently seen a devastating blow to its sugar industry,\non which thousands of our people depend, as a result of\ntrade liberalization and the reform of the European\nUnion\u2019s sugar regime. Unless small States like ours are\nprovided with special and differential treatment, they\nwill be excluded from the global economy.\nNext year, the world\u2019s leaders will meet to review\nthe progress made in achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). All the indications are\nthat there is hardly enough time to achieve our\nobjectives. We can therefore ill afford to stand still. We\nmust determine now what ought to be done to build\nand sustain momentum to meet the 2015 targets.\nGuyana\u2019s experience has been that these are not likely\nto be achieved without sustained economic growth.\nAlthough we have sound poverty reduction and\nnational development strategies in place, we know that\nsuccess depends in fair measure on a fair and\nsupportive international environment. We therefore\nurge that high priority be accorded to greater debt\nrelief, the mobilization of development finance and the\ncreation of equitable trading conditions to enable\ndeveloping countries such as ours to achieve economic\nand social progress.\nIt must be realized, however, that the MDGs,\nalthough important and laudable, will not in\nthemselves bring about comprehensive and sustainable\ndevelopment. They are but a subset of the development\nagenda, which must include, if it is to be successful,\npolitical, economic, social and environmental\nconsiderations. Without a holistic and well-coordinated\napproach, lasting solutions to our problems will not be\nfound. It is for that reason that my Government\ncontinues to advocate the establishment of a new\nglobal human order based on genuine interdependence\nand partnership between developed and developing\ncountries. We are at a point in time when terror, war,\npoverty and social chaos threaten to engulf all\nhumanity. We therefore hope that when the relevant\nitem comes before the Assembly next month, it will\nreceive the further support of the international\ncommunity.\nWithin recent years the United Nations has faced\nmounting criticism for its lack of responsiveness to\nglobal challenges and for its failure to be democratic in\nsome of its decision-making. While there is often a\nrush to act on particular issues that are deemed\nimportant by some countries, much less attention is\npaid to the concerns of the vast majority. As a\nconsequence, the credibility and even the legitimacy of\nthe United Nations have been called into question. If\nthat trend continues, the hard-earned prestige of the\nOrganization will be debased and its effectiveness\ncurtailed. There can be no worse danger to humanity\nthan the rejection of multilateralism. We believe\nexperience has now clearly shown that unilateralism\ncannot resolve the problems of our contemporary\nworld. Only through joint endeavours can we hope to\nachieve the freedom from fear and the freedom from\nwant to which all our peoples aspire.\nAs has been so aptly said, the United Nations\nmay not take us to heaven but it can certainly save us\nfrom hell. Let us therefore renew our commitment to\nthe high purposes and principles for which it stands."

        "file_text": "Allow\nme at the outset to convey to the President my\nGovernment's congratulations on his election to\npreside over the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nWe have no doubt that his wisdom and experience\nwill be of great service to the Organization at a time\nwhen it must make important decisions, in particular\nconcerning the reform of the Security Council. He will\nsurely do honour to all Africa.\nI also take this occasion to express our gratitude\nand congratulations to Mr. Julian Hunte for the\nexcellent quality of his presidency at the fifty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nIn April this year, the whole world joined\nRwanda in our observance of the tenth anniversary of\n44\n\nthe 1994 genocide, in which more than a million of our\ncitizens - men, women and children - were\nmassacred by the former Government, which\ninstitutionalized hatred, discrimination and\nsectarianism.\nWe thank in particular the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council for joining us in this Hall last\n7 April to pay tribute to the memory of the victims in\nRwanda and to renew our commitment to ensuring that\nthe horrors of genocide do not occur again, in any part\nof the world.\nThat tragedy of genocide and its many\nconsequences obliged us in Rwanda to undertake the\nnational and collective duty of examining our\nconscience. We believe we have learned so much in\nsorrow from that task that we have undertaken concrete\nmeasures in that respect.\nIn the process, we created the National Unity and\nReconciliation Commission, which has led the national\ndialogue over the last five years. We have also\nundertaken vast reforms at all levels and in many areas\nof national life, which, among other things, enable\npeople to develop initiatives and to participate in\ndecisions affecting their own development. We have\nthus adopted a new constitution, which, for the first\ntime in the history of our country, was conceived by\nthe people of Rwanda themselves and drafted\naccording to the ideas, concerns, aspirations and\npriorities of the people and not according to those of\nso-called legal experts from other continents. This new\nconstitution guarantees the freedoms and fundamental\nrights of the people, brings together universal\nprinciples and national realities, but also, and above\nall, offers measures to exclude once and for all from\nour society the poor governance that led to the\ngenocide in 1994.\nWe have carried out important legal reforms that\nhave indeed restored our judicial system. In the search\nfor justice that will restore and reconcile our people,\nwe have introduced traditional participatory\njurisdiction - known as Gacaca - to judge the\nthousands of those presumed to be implicated in the\ncrimes committed during the genocide.\nWe are also now transforming our economy by\nemphasizing innovation, competitiveness, the role of\nnew information and communication technology and\nthe improvement of public services as the appropriate\nway to achieve economic growth and lasting national\ndevelopment. We have carried out other reforms in the\nareas of education, health, security and the\nadvancement of women in public administration to\nsuch an extent that today Rwanda leads the countries\nhaving the largest number of women elected to national\ndecision-making posts.\nRwanda is contributing, albeit modestly, to all the\npeace processes underway in our region and other areas\nof Africa. In this context, my Government did not\nhesitate to respond to the appeal of the African Union\nregarding Darfur and sent a military mission to\ncontribute to the efforts of the international community\nand the Sudanese Government to restore peace to this\nsorely tested region of our dear continent.\nWe feel that the international community also\nneeds to engage in some soul-searching in order to\nreflect on the lessons to be learned from the failures of\nthe past and to re-examine its responses to crisis\nsituations such as the genocide of 1994 in Rwanda. We\nshould therefore ask ourselves if we really do have a\nsystem of early warning in place to detect emerging\ncrises. Can we say that today, more than yesterday, we\nhave the political will necessary to respond decisively\nand appropriately around the world to these emerging\ncrises? Is the world's division into major Powers'\nzones of influence not continuing today \u00f3 just as it did\nin 1994 in Rwanda - to prevent the United Nations\nfrom formulating just and effective responses to crisis\nsituations?\nEvery Member of this Assembly is certainly\naware of the magnitude and the frightening scope of\nterrorism as well as the challenge it poses to\ninternational peace and security. Indeed, from the\nRussian Federation, through Spain, Indonesia, Kenya\nand to the United States, terrorists are causing\ndevastation, even using innocent women and children\nto achieve their unspeakable goals.\nThe Great Lakes region in Africa is certainly\nacquainted with terrorism. Indeed, the forces that\ncommitted genocide in Rwanda, namely Rwanda\u00eds\nformer Forces armees rwandaises (ex-FAR) and the\nINTERAHAMWE continue to bring death and\ndevastation with unsurpassed cruelty to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. You all\ncertainly know of their most recent and sinister deed,\ncarried out barely two months ago, when this same\ngroup, together with the Forces nationales de liberation\n(FNL) rebels of Burundi, attacked a refugee camp in\n45\n\nBanyamulenge in Gatumba, Burundi, and massacred\n160 innocent people \u00f3 men, women and children \u00f3\nbecause of their ethnic origin.\nThe most incomprehensible and unacceptable\nthing for us is the well-known fact that the bases of all\nthese groups are located in the east of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and that their leaders are well-\nknown, but that no serious international action has\nbeen undertaken, to date, to destroy these bases and to\narrest their leaders. And yet, in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, almost in the very same\nlocation as these genocidal forces, there is a well-\narmed United Nations force, which is costing the\ninternational community a mere $700 million per year.\nWe need to seriously ask ourselves whether the\ninternational community has learned any lessons from\nthe tragedy of Rwanda. In our humble view, the United\nNations should assume its responsibilities and take the\nnecessary measures to disarm, demobilize and\nrepatriate the terrorist and genocidal groups in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which continue to\ndestroy with impunity entire communities in our region\nand which have been the source of two wars in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, directly involving\nup to eight African countries.\nMy Government feels that, just as the\ninternational community has the responsibility or\nobligation to guarantee the protection of individuals in\nserious danger, it is also responsible for protecting and\nsupporting those who have escaped from those\nsituations. It is in this context that, since 1994, the\nGovernment of Rwanda has reserved 5 per cent of its\nannual budget for priority contributions to the health\ncare and education needs of those who escaped the\ngenocide. In the same spirit, and during the current\nsession of the Assembly, a draft resolution will be\nsubmitted, requesting the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations to mobilize the entire United Nations\nsystem to give financial support to our domestic\nefforts, which remain, despite everything, insufficient\nwith regard to the real - if not vital - needs\nparticularly of the orphans, widows and victims of\nsexual abuse. We hope that it will receive your support.\nMy Government has followed with great interest\nthe current discussions regarding reform in the Security\nCouncil. Rwanda, which has been the subject of debate\nalmost continuously in the Council for 14 years, is\nmore sensitive than many other nations to the need to\nmake this powerful body of our Organization more\nrepresentative and democratic. We feel, in particular,\nthat it is high time to end the marginalization of the\ncontinents of Africa and Latin America by granting\nthem permanent seats in the Security Council.\nWhile emphasis is quite rightly being given to the\nexpansion of the Council and regional representation,\nwe firmly believe that equal attention should be\ndevoted to improving the Council's methods of work\nand that emphasis should be placed on their\ntransparency. We hope that this aspect will be taken\ninto account by all the parties concerned; otherwise,\nthis reform will be cut short and will not have any real\nimpact. In particular, we are deeply concerned that an\nunwritten rule, nowhere to be found in print, seems to\nhave reserved the initiative for making proposals only\nto the permanent members of the Security Council.\nEven more worrying is the apparent division of the\nworld into spheres of influence, with each permanent\nmember having the almost absolute and exclusive right\nto propose draft resolutions and presidential statements\nrelating to its own zone of influence. This situation\ndoes no credit to the Organization and seriously\nundermines the credibility of the Security Council and\nits decisions.\nMy Government has taken note of the\nimprovements which have been made towards greater\nefficiency in the International Criminal Tribunal for\nRwanda, and encourages the Office of the Prosecutor\nand the Registry to pursue their efforts to end the waste\nand corruption which have characterized the Tribunal.\nAnd it is from that standpoint that we guarantee our\nfull support for the Tribunal in the implementation of\nits completion strategy. We are awaiting the upcoming\nconclusion of agreements regarding the transfer of\ncertain accused to be tried, as well as some who have\nalready been convicted and who will serve their\nsentences in Rwanda, which we feel is a token of trust\nand of restored cooperation.\nIn conclusion, for us, support for economic\ndevelopment remains one of the greatest raisons d\u00ed\u00cdtre\nof the Organization. As I speak, as members know,\nhundreds of thousands of people in Africa are facing\nhunger, poverty and disease and are living in great\ndespair. The United Nations, therefore, needs to\nmobilize, concentrate and guide all our collective\nefforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals\nand to pull the African continent out of its current\npolitical and economic difficulties. Here, the New\n46\n\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is a\nkind of reassuring road map and framework, that is\nhelping us to bring about the rebirth and prosperity of\nAfrica.\nThus, this universal family of nations should\nreject the current situation with half of us living in\naffluence, prosperity and good health, while the other\nhalf is dying of hunger and disease, which all of us\ntogether can prevent and eradicate. Let us, therefore,\nwork all together to change this situation."

        "file_text": "Today, the international\ncommunity is striving to meet challenges that the\nfounders of the United Nations could not have\nenvisioned sixty years ago. The fight against terrorism\nand efforts to ensure non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction are just a few examples of those\nchallenges.\nJapan has always pursued international\ncooperation centring on the United Nations. As the\ninternational community faces new realities, the United\nNations must adapt and address them.\nThe United Nations was created to bring about a\npeaceful, prosperous, and just world. To that end,\nMember States have united their strengths to promote\ninternational cooperation. Convinced that it can\ncontribute to creating a better world through its own\ncapabilities, Japan has endeavoured steadfastly to fulfil\nits role as a responsible United Nations Member. Our\nactivities in Iraq and Afghanistan offer excellent\nexamples.\nIn Iraq, based on the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, Japan has joined international efforts to\nassist in the Iraqi people's own struggle towards a\ndemocratic and prosperous nation. Japan has been\ncooperating with the Iraqi people to help them improve\ntheir daily life and rebuild the foundation of their\npublic life.\nThe humanitarian and reconstruction activities of\nJapan\u00eds Self-Defence Forces and its financial\nassistance of $5 billion are working in tandem to that\nend. In order to promote international solidarity, Japan\nwill host the third Meeting of the Donors\u00ed Committee\nof the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for\nIraq next month.\nIn Afghanistan, Japan has from the very\nbeginning taken the lead in assisting national\nreconstruction efforts. Japan hosted the International\nConference on Reconstruction Assistance to\nAfghanistan in January 2002. Japan has been actively\npromoting Afghan efforts for disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration. The Afghan people\nare working hard to prepare for presidential as well as\nparliamentary elections. Those elections are the most\n32\n\nimportant milestones for a new, democratic\nAfghanistan.\nThe international community and the United\nNations must stand by the Afghan and Iraqi peoples in\ntheir strenuous efforts to rebuild their countries.\nWeapons of mass destruction, missiles and\nterrorism threaten international security in today\u00eds\nworld. Japan is the only country ever to have suffered\nnuclear devastation. As such, Japan has been at the\nforefront in promoting nuclear disarmament and non-\nproliferation. Japan hopes to achieve a peaceful and\nsafe world free of nuclear weapons. Furthermore,\nJapan has collaborated with other countries to prevent\nStates of concern and non-State actors from acquiring\nweapons of mass destruction.\nWe must allow no room for terrorism to prevail.\nIn the fight against terrorism, Japan is doing its utmost\nto strengthen domestic legislation and related\nmeasures, and will continue to cooperate with other\ncountries.\nThe nuclear and missile issues on the Korean\npeninsula present a serious challenge to the peace and\nstability of north-east Asia and to the international\ncommunity as a whole. Japan is determined to continue\nto seek a comprehensive resolution of the nuclear and\nmissile issues and the abduction issue in line with the\nPyongyang Declaration. The six-party talks must go\nforward. The benefit that the Democratic People\u00eds\nRepublic of Korea would receive by resolving those\nissues would be substantial. There is no benefit for it in\ncontinuing to pursue its nuclear programme.\nAfter the Second World War, Japan experienced a\ndramatic economic recovery, with the help of the\ninternational community. On the basis of our own\nexperience, we are keenly aware that, in promoting\ninternational cooperation, self-help efforts are essential\nto overcoming difficulties and achieving a prosperous\nsociety. Japan\u00eds official development assistance\ntherefore has been based on the principles of ownership\nand partnership.\nEnvironmental conservation must also proceed\nhand in hand with economic development. Japan has\ntaken the lead in global efforts in such areas as climate\nchange and environmental protection.\nIn addressing development challenges, including\nthe Millennium Development Goals, Japan will move\nforward, making further efforts for the strategic and\neffective use of official development assistance,\nbearing those principles in mind.\nThe protection and empowerment of individuals\nand communities is the foundation of international\npeace and security. That is why Japan is advocating the\nconcept of human security. Based upon that idea, Japan\nis making efforts to realize a seamless transition from\nhumanitarian assistance to reconstruction support in\ncountries such as Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and\nTimor-Leste.\nIt is my strong belief that there can be no stability\nand prosperity in the world unless Africa\u00eds issues are\nresolved. Japan initiated the process of the Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD) in 1993. Last year, Japan organized\nTICAD III, with the participation of 89 countries and\n47 international organizations. African countries are\nnow promoting regional collaboration through the\nAfrican Union and working to implement the New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development (NEPAD).\nThe collaboration between TICAD and NEPAD is\nsignificant, because both processes are grounded in the\nprinciples of ownership and partnership. A stable and\nprosperous Africa depends upon the promotion of trade\nand investment, together with official development\nassistance. This autumn, Japan will host the TICAD\nAsia-Africa Trade and Investment Conference.\nToday, in Africa, we are witnessing the unfolding\nof another humanitarian crisis. We share the\ninternational community\u00eds grave concern over Darfur.\nJapan has decided to provide humanitarian assistance\nof $21 million. In addition, Japan intends to provide in-\nkind assistance to the Sudanese refugees in Chad.\nIn East Asia, there has been remarkable economic\ndevelopment. Japan has been working with the\ncountries in the region to build solid foundations for\ntheir own efforts towards economic development. In\nthat region, active efforts are also under way to foster\ncommunity-building. Building upon the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Plus Three, I have\nadvocated the idea of an East Asia community.\nThis year, Japan is a candidate for non-permanent\nmembership on the Security Council. Japan, if elected,\nwill redouble its efforts to play a constructive and\ninnovative role in the Council, based on its global\ncontributions.\n33\n\nAs the international community rises to meet the\nchallenges we face in today\u00eds world, the United\nNations must not be left on the sidelines. We need a\nstrong and effective United Nations. Indeed, we must\ncreate a new United Nations for the new era. I applaud\nthe timely initiative by the Secretary-General of\nestablishing the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change. I trust that the Panel will\npresent the Secretary-General with a bold and\nambitious plan for reforming the United Nations.\nPeace and security, and economic and social\nissues are increasingly intertwined. The response of the\nUnited Nations must be coordinated and\ncomprehensive. United Nations agencies and organs\nmust be effective and efficient. Changes are needed\nthroughout the United Nations system.\nThe reform of the Security Council must be at the\ncore of those changes. In recent years, the role of the\nSecurity Council has expanded dramatically in scope\nand nature. The Security Council must fulfil its\nexpanded role, with the maximum cooperation and\nparticipation of the international community.\nTo that end, the Security Council must improve\nits representation to better reflect today's world. In\naddition, the Council must be provided with adequate\nresources to address challenges effectively. Countries\nwith the will and the resources to play a major role in\ninternational peace and security must always take part\nin the Council\u00eds decision-making process. The Security\nCouncil therefore needs to be expanded, both in its\npermanent and non-permanent categories, adding new\nmembers from both developing and developed\ncountries.\nThe universal purpose of the United Nations \u00f3\nour common goal - is to maintain international peace\nand security. In striving towards that goal, each\nMember State must fulfil its role, commensurate with\nits own capabilities.\nIt is our conviction that peace cannot be achieved\nthrough force alone. On the basis of that conviction,\nJapan has played an active and distinctive role. Japan\nhas made considerable resources available for United\nNations peacekeeping operations, as well as for\nreconstruction efforts to assist in the consolidation of\npeace. Japan\u00eds Self-Defense Forces have conducted\nhumanitarian and reconstruction activities in such areas\nas Timor-Leste and Iraq.\nSuch global contributions to peace are rooted in\nthe fundamental, cherished beliefs of the Japanese\npeople, who have been seeking an honoured place in an\ninternational community that strives for peace and\nprosperity. Those contributions are, I believe, greatly\nappreciated by the international community.\nRecent United Nations peace operations show\nthat there are many dimensions to the achievement and\nconsolidation of peace. Making peace a reality requires\ncomprehensive efforts, ranging from peace-building to\nnation-building. Japan's role has thus become\nincreasingly vital to the maintenance of international\npeace and security, which is precisely the mandate of\nthe Security Council. We believe that the role that\nJapan has played provides a solid basis for its\nassumption of permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil.\nIn order to better reflect today's world, it is also\nnecessary to remove the 'enemy State' clauses from\nthe Charter, as the General Assembly has already\nrecognized those provisions to be obsolete.\nThe scale of assessments for Member States\nneeds to be more balanced.\nNext year, the United Nations will celebrate its\nsixtieth anniversary. We will hold a high-level plenary\nmeeting to review progress on all of the commitments\nin the Millennium Declaration. Development, global\nsecurity and United Nations reform are all high on the\nagenda. Changes are needed on all fronts. The time has\ncome to make a historic decision to reform the United\nNations, and the Security Council in particular.\nTime is limited. Our future - the future of the\nUnited Nations - is at stake. I would like to call upon\nthe members of this body to work together and take a\nbold step towards the creation of a new United Nations\nfor the new era."

        "file_text": "Belgium\u2019s international commitment is rooted in the\nconviction that initiatives taken at the global level can\nmove forward only through dialogue and cooperation.\nThe careful European building process taught us that.\nThat is why Belgium firmly believes in the virtues of\nmultilateralism. We are stronger standing together than\nalone. By standing together, we benefit from greater\nlegitimacy and therefore have better opportunities to\nmake our voices heard.\nThe challenges facing the United Nations have\nthe virtue of being clear. As the Secretary-General has\nsaid, the options that become available to the world\nwill depend on the answers that we provide. The\nOrganization\u2019s credibility will continue to be judged by\nits effectiveness and its results on the ground. We must\nimprove and strengthen the United Nations apparatus.\nWe fully support the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts in this\ndifficult task. At the same time, we believe that the\nUnited Nations system should better reflect the new\ninternational realities.\nThe sustained commitment of the United Nations\nis required if we are to find a definitive solution to the\n42\n\ncrisis in the Great Lakes region. The conflict there has\nalready cost millions of lives. We must not fail to\nrespond; inaction would constitute negligence. While I\ndo not underestimate the difficulties in this regard, I\nam convinced that a solution can be found. I refuse to\nbelieve, therefore, that the stabilization process is\ndoomed to deadlock or failure. In order to find a\nsolution, however, the international community must\nshow that it can make a difference. In that regard, it is\nencouraging to note how dedicated the Secretary-\nGeneral is to his mission. For its part, Belgium will\ncontinue to appeal to its European Union partners for a\ncollective and committed involvement in the region.\nIt is essential that stability and security be fully\nestablished and guaranteed in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo. It is clear that the transition process must\nbe successful. We in the international community\ncannot emphasize enough that political leaders have\nthe duty to make it succeed. Indeed, there is no\nalternative to that process as a means of achieving\npeace and development in the region.\nNation-building is impossible as long as impunity\nand insecurity exist. In that respect, the restructuring\nand the integration of the army are essential, as is the\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants.\nBelgium is currently training almost 300 Congolese\nsoldiers under its Train the Trainers programme.\nIt is also essential that the International\nCommittee to Accompany the Transition fully shoulder\nits responsibilities. For its part, Belgium is committed\nto taking an active part in the implementation of the\ndeclaration adopted by the countries members of that\nCommittee.\nThe United Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) is\nplaying a crucial role, and Belgium attaches great\nimportance to that. It is not only the credibility of the\nUnited Nations that is at stake here, but \u2014 more\nimportant \u2014 the future of an entire region. Belgium\ntherefore supports a better targeted mandate for\nMONUC, as well as a strengthening of its means.\nWith our European partners, we are also\nconsidering the best way of making a joint contribution\nto that Mission. It goes without saying that the\nelections scheduled for 2005 will be crucial. They will\nrequire substantial human and financial means, to\nwhich Belgium has already decided it will contribute.\nWith regard to the situation in Rwanda, we offer\nour full support to the praiseworthy efforts made to\nachieve reconciliation. Normalized relations between\nRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\nabsolutely indispensable and must be based on\ncollaboration and good-neighbourly relations. This\nimplies a mutual respect of the borders.\nIn many regards, the latest developments in\nBurundi are encouraging. A constitution has been\nadopted, a referendum has been announced and an\nelectoral commission is in place. Elections are\nessential, of course, which is why Belgium has\nprovided significant financial backing to their\norganization. I urge the international community to\nspecify without delay what resources it is ready to\nmobilize for this purpose.\nBelgium shares the concerns about the\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur. There is no excuse for\nthe persecution and systematic massacre of thousands\nof human beings. Given the scale of the suffering, the\nefforts and the progress made thus far remain\ninsufficient. Belgium therefore insists on the swift\nestablishment of an international commission of\ninquiry.\nThe situation in Iraq will continue to present a\nconsiderable challenge over the coming months and\neven years. I congratulate the United Nations for its\ncontinued support to the Iraqi transition process,\nespecially given the country\u2019s climate of insecurity.\nThe population of Iraq, which has already faced so\nmany ordeals, must finally be able to live in peace. It\nis, of course, the Iraqi people who must shoulder the\nresponsibility of guiding the political process, a\nprocess that must lead to the creation of a new\nparliament, a new constitution and a sovereign\nGovernment. This Government must be capable of\nensuring the well-being of its citizens, as well as the\ncountry\u2019s security, with no external assistance. To date,\nBelgium has allocated approximately \u20ac17 million to\nthe reconstruction process and we will provide air\ntransportation for the United Nations Assistance\nMission for Iraq (UNAMI) personnel between Amman\nand Baghdad.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nposes a serious threat to world security. The regime of\nnon-proliferation is jeopardized by an alarming\nsituation; the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\nmust regain its place within this regime without delay.\n43\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is located in a region full\nof tensions, and its security concerns are legitimate.\nThe international community should therefore take this\ninto account in its approach to the problem. And the\nIranian authorities must cooperate entirely with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and cease all\nactivities linked to the enrichment of uranium. By so\ndoing, Iran will contribute significantly to the\nstabilization and prosperity of the region.\nThe tragedy in Beslan has proved once again that\nterrorism attacks blindly. It goes without saying that no\nform of terrorism is justifiable. The indignation and\nanalysis that such acts may provoke can in no way vary\naccording to the victim, the location, the aggressor or\nthe circumstances. Appropriate military means and\nsecurity measures will remain necessary in order to\nfight terrorism, but means other than strictly military\nones are also required. Indeed, the environment in\nwhich terrorism thrives is comprised of ideological,\nsocio-economic, political and other variables.\nThis is why I plead for a dialogue between the\nWest and the Arab and Muslim world, involving not\nonly political leaders but also spiritual leaders, and not\nas a mere exchange of ideas or points of view, but in\norder to identify the instruments that could deny such\nbarbarous acts all legitimacy and raison d\u2019\u00eatre, with a\nview to finally bringing this appalling logic of death to\na halt."

        "file_text": " We wish to extend our\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. We would also like to thank to Mr. Julian\nHunte and the Secretary-General for their efforts\nduring this difficult year.\nLast year, we expressed our concern about the\nrestoration of sovereignty in Iraq and the\nreinvigoration of the Middle East peace process. This\nyear, we wish especially to note the critical need to end\nthe tragedy in Darfur. Armenians, victims of the\ntwentieth century\u2019s first genocide, know well the long-\nlasting effects of victimization and homelessness. This\nis no way to begin a new millennium. The benefits of\nglobalization should be utilized to overcome this\nnewest global crisis.\nWe also comprehend all too well that peace and\nsecurity abroad and at home are clearly associated with\n18\n\nsocial and economic dignity today \u2014 or with faith in\ntheir possible attainment tomorrow. Neither self-\nsatisfied smugness on the one hand nor self-righteous\nviolence on the other are solutions to the great\ninequalities that exist around the world and within each\nof our countries, even the most developed of them.\nTerrorism, in all its manifestations, affects\nsecurity and political and economic stability in our\nneighbourhoods and throughout our planet. Terrorism,\nfrom Madrid to Beslan, in all its manifestations, is\ninexcusable and unacceptable. Cognizant that the\nsuccess of counter-terrorism efforts is dependent upon\ncollective measures, Armenia has readily joined the\nglobal fight against international terrorism. That fight\nmust go beyond effective regional and international\ncooperation. It must include the very goals of the\nMillennium Declaration: replacing deprivation, poverty\nand injustice with universal respect for human rights\nand democracy, economic development, equality and\nsocial justice.\nIn Armenia we have had a year in which\neconomic growth went hand in hand with increased\nparticipation in international organizations, particularly\nin the United Nations. Our position in the Human\nDevelopment Index gives us the confidence to continue\non our path of economic development. We will also\nwork hard to bolster public-private partnerships. We\nare proud that Armenia\u2019s major enterprises are finding\nways to contribute to art and culture, to invest in public\nlife and to become partners in our society\u2019s pursuit of\nhappiness and quality of life.\nIn 2005, the international community will review\nthe progress that has been made in the implementation\nof the global development agenda. It would be most\nuseful if we could focus our resources on the\nimplementation of the agenda rather than on restating\nour collective good intentions. In other words, we must\nfind the political will to make the political and\nfinancial commitments necessary to overcome the\noutstanding obstacles.\nThe Millennium Development Goals are\nguidelines for Armenia. To that end, the empowerment\nof women, the protection of children and the fight\nagainst poverty are not just goals for us: they are\nbuilding blocks for a prosperous, healthy and stable\nsociety. The Government of Armenia has approved\nnational action plans on the protection of the rights of\nthe child, on improving the status of women and\nenhancing their role in our society and on preventing\ntrafficking in persons. In addition, a broad anti-\ncorruption strategy, developed with the participation\nand counsel of the international community, will\ncomplement the poverty reduction strategy programme\nthat is already beginning to yield results.\nWe are continuing our effective collaboration\nwith United Nations bodies on a number of important\nissues, including use of information and\ncommunication technologies to improve governance\nand institutionalize public/private interactions. With\ndonor community support, focused institution-building\nand good governance, we expect that the human rights\nand democratic reforms of the past decade will go\nbeyond the solid legislative framework that has already\nbeen developed and will take root \u2014 psychologically\nand socially \u2014 in our society.\nArmenia, as an active member of the Economic\nand Social Council and the Commission on Human\nRights, will remain involved in international\ndevelopment cooperation. At the same time, we will\nparticipate in the effort to improve the consultation and\ncoordination mechanisms that are essential for the\neffectiveness of the collective security system and we\nlook forward to the assessment of the High-level Panel\non Threats, Challenges and Change.\nWe stand for broader cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations to ensure\nthe broader involvement and commitment of countries\nin decision-making and implementation processes.\nReform is necessary within those valued organizations\nif we are to effectively address today\u2019s realities and\nchallenges and resolve tomorrow\u2019s problems. To do\nthat, we cannot work with yesterday\u2019s mechanisms. A\nrevitalized General Assembly is indispensable for\neffective United Nations action. We would also support\nJapan, Germany and India joining countries from\nAfrica and Latin America as permanent members of an\nenlarged and more representative Security Council.\nIn a few short years, Armenia has done away with\nthe false proposition that we must choose between East\nand West, between the old world and the new. We have\ndone away with the myth that our neighbours can\ncontrol the pace of our economic development and\nshape its direction. Now we want to do away with the\nvery dangerous notion that yesterday\u2019s adversaries are\nenemies forever.\n19\n\nArmenia is ready to compromise and collaborate\nwith neighbours who are ready to join us in making\nhistory, not rewriting it. We want to work with an\nAzerbaijan that understands its place in a rule-based\ninternational order, not one whose policies, practices\nand statements threaten the fragile peace and stability\nof our region.\nAzerbaijan was the first to introduce ethnic\ncleansing in the Soviet space, the first to engage\nmercenaries and international terrorists in its own\ndefence and the first to discard the \u201crules of\nengagement\u201d in international organizations.\nLet me explain. The Armenian presence in the\nregion of the Caucasus has been long and extensive.\nIndeed, denying or rewriting that history requires\nsystematic planning, energy and resources.\nUnfortunately, the Government of Azerbaijan has not\nspared those resources. Azerbaijan succeeded in\neliminating the Armenians of Nakhichevan, who\ncomprised more than half the population there. There\nwere more than 400,000 Armenians living in\nAzerbaijan during the Soviet period. The pogroms of\nSumgait and Baku led to the fact that there are none\ntoday. Indeed, the Azerbaijani experiment in ethnic\ncleansing worked.\nA decade ago, Azerbaijan retained the services of\nmercenaries and international terrorists \u2014 the same\nnames we hear today \u2014 to fight against the Armenian\nmen and women who were defending their own lands\nand homes against aerial bombings and proximate\nshelling. The terrorists lost, Armenians won.\nFinally, Azerbaijan\u2019s leadership dismisses the\nopportunities offered by membership in international\norganizations to build bridges and seek solutions.\nToday, Azerbaijan rejects mediation by those who wish\nto help halt drug trafficking through its territory. It\ndismisses efforts by the Council of Europe and other\nmonitoring groups to come to the region and see with\ntheir own eyes, at first hand, the destruction of\nthousands of irreplaceable historic and cultural\nmarkers. Azerbaijan squawks about its desire for\nNATO membership, even as it repeatedly prohibits a\npartner\u2019s participation in NATO exercises. Worse,\nAzerbaijan not only does not rebuke, it champions the\nAzerbaijani military officer who decapitated a fellow\nArmenian officer in a NATO training course in\nBudapest. It maligns the Minsk Group of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\nhide its own refusal to consider the proposals that have\ngrown from the discussions and negotiations in which\nits own leadership has participated. For more than half\na decade, Azerbaijan has rejected every proposal\nbefore it from the \u201ccommon State\u201d proposal in 1998 to\nthe Key West document of 2001.\nArmenians prevailed in the military confrontation\nunleashed by Azerbaijan in response to the peaceful\ndemands of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh for self-\ndetermination. Contrary to the assertion made by\nAzerbaijan\u2019s President from this podium, Armenians\nhave occupied those lands for over 2,000 years, and not\njust the last 10. Today, Nagorno-Karabakh has reversed\nthe injustice done by Stalin back in the mid-1920s. It is\nfree, democratic and tolerant of minorities. Nagorno-\nKarabakh holds regular elections, has State and\nsecurity structures, completely controls its own\nterritory and has a growing economy.\nIf in the past century Armenians and Azerbaijanis\nwere forcibly linked together, in the present century \u2014\nin which we have won the right to our own destinies \u2014\nwe can determine to live together peaceably. If we are\nserious about becoming full, deserving residents of the\nEuropean neighbourhood \u2014 where borders do not\ncount, but intentions and tolerance do \u2014 we will have\nto come to terms with our past, with our history and\nwith the realities that have gripped our region."

        "file_text": "I have the distinct honour\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, a distinguished\nAfrican diplomat, on your election to preside over the\nfifty-ninth session of this Assembly and to wish you\nsuccess in your undertaking. I would also like to\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for the\ndedication and commitment that he brought to bear on\nhis stewardship of the fifty-eighth session.\nThree years ago, a terrible tragedy hit this city.\nThe unprecedented terrorist attacks of 11 September\nresulted in the death of thousands of innocent people of\nmany nationalities, including some from my own\ncountry, Ghana. The whole world shared the pain and\nsorrow of New York in the aftermath of those\natrocities. The whole world also rose in solidarity with\nthe people of the United States to ensure that such\ntragedies would not happen again.\n11 September reminds us of the importance of\nseeking a multilateral and peaceful means for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\nespecially now, when it has become evident that only\ncollective, multilateral efforts will suffice to defeat the\nnew scourge of mankind, global terrorism.\nThe United Nations has an indispensable role to\nplay, being the most universal and representative\nintergovernmental organization and the best forum for\nthe practice of multilateralism. However, the success of\n18\n\nmultilateralism and collective security will depend on\nhow the reforms of the United Nations system are\nimplemented. In this regard, we applaud the initiative\nof our illustrious compatriot, Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan, in setting up the United Nations High-Level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, to make\nproposals on how the United Nations can best be\nreformed to meet the new challenges of our world.\nWe, in Africa, agree that the objectives of the\nUnited Nations reforms, including the revitalization of\nthe General Assembly and the reform of the Security\nCouncil, are aimed at enhancing the role of the\nOrganization and its capacity to overcome current\nthreats and emerging challenges. The reforms should\nbe in conformity with the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations Charter and the process must be\nbased on full consultations in a democratic and\ntransparent manner. To this end, we look forward to a\nrevitalized General Assembly that would assume its\nrightful position as the most authoritative and\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations.\nWith regard to the Security Council, the African\nposition emphasizes the need to democratize and ensure\nequitable geographical representation, with Africa\nallotted no less than two permanent seats and five non-\npermanent seats in the expanded Security Council.\nI wish to address the crucial issue of poverty\neradication and the promotion of sustainable\ndevelopment in developing countries in which\nwidespread poverty is endemic, particularly in Africa.\nAs we strive to overcome our current economic woes,\nwe need the world\u00eds solidarity, resources, technical\nknow-how and support. The historic Millennium\nSummit of the United Nations, which brought together\n189 nations in September 2000 and adopted the\nMillennium Declaration, was a clarion call for action to\nsolve these problems and set forth the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals with measurable goals and targets\nfor combating them. On that occasion, the international\ncommunity pledged to spare no effort to free our\nfellow men, women and children from the abject and\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.\nAfrica has adopted the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which reaffirms our belief that\nAfricans have the primary responsibility to solve the\nproblems of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy\nafflicting the majority of our population and to stem\nAfrica's marginalization from global markets. In tandem,\nwe are striving to foster political stability, accountable\nand transparent governance under the rule of law,\nbecause we believe it is the right thing to do. Ghana\nhas volunteered as the first country in Africa for the\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, and my Government\nis cooperating with the review panel to facilitate the\npreparation of the review report, because we in Ghana\ncherish very much our democracy and our commitment\nof respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nOur renewed resolve, within the context of\nNEPAD, to accelerate the sustainable development of\nthe continent, dovetails fully with the avowed\ncommitment of the international community to help\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. It was,\ntherefore, a very welcome and positive development\nwhen the General Assembly, in its resolution 57/7 of\n4 November 2002, urged the international community\nto organize support for African countries within the\nframework of the principles, objectives and priorities\nof NEPAD. However, for this convergence of vision\nand effort to yield the desired results, there must be\ngenuine partnership between Africa and the\ninternational community.\nThe implementation of NEPAD and the creation\nof institutions such as the Pan-African Parliament, the\nPeace and Security Council, the Economic, Social and\nCultural Council, and various commissions of the\nrecently established African Union, reflect Africa\u00eds\ndetermination to be the architect of its own future. The\ninitiatives of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, the West African regional body\ncurrently chaired by the President of Ghana, Mr. John\nAgyekum Kufuor, in dealing with the conflicts that\nhave recently plagued our region are good examples of\nthis development. Accra has been the venue for\nsuccessful peace talks concerning Liberia and, most\nrecently, on 29 July 2004, C\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire, which has\nrevived hopes for a durable peace in that important\nWest African country.\nThe important decisions taken at the last summit\nof the African Union in Addis Ababa have given cause\nfor cautious optimism as the political leadership,\nGovernments, the public, civil society and the private\nsector now seem to have embarked upon a journey of\ncollaborative effort to put an end to conflicts and to\nfocus instead on the promotion of peace, security and\nsustainable development for the benefit of the peoples\nof the continent.\n19\n\nIt is disheartening, though, to observe that,\ndespite the good intentions of the international\ncommunity, as exemplified at the various international\nforums that have followed the Millennium Summit,\nthere has not been any significant achievement due to\nthe absence of genuine global partnership for\ndevelopment. There continues to be an agonizing paradox\nbetween the summit and conference declarations of a\nnew global partnership and the persistence of an\nasymmetrical global system that works largely against\nthe interests of developing countries.\nQuite evidently, the laudable long-term initiatives\nto halve hunger and poverty by the year 2015 cannot be\nachieved without a fundamental restructuring of the\nglobal trade system, particularly in agricultural\nproducts. Such an initiative should include developed\ncountries\u00ed dismantling subsidies and lowering tariffs,\nthereby helping to uphold and safeguard an open,\nequitable, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory\ntrading and financial system. The concerns of\ndeveloping countries have been reiterated in this\nAssembly over the years; we therefore urge our\ndeveloped partners to act now.\nFor many countries in Africa, stable long-term\nplanning will be impossible without more systematic\nand sustained debt relief. Despite the progress recorded\nin the implementation of the enhanced Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the\nprovision of substantial debt relief by bilateral official\ncreditors, achieving long-term debt sustainability and,\nat the same time, a reduction in poverty as targeted,\nremains a major problem for many African countries.\nWe, therefore, welcome the initiative of British Prime\nMinister Tony Blair in setting up the African\nCommission.\nOfficial development assistance (ODA), as we are\naware, continues to play an essential role in\ncomplementing other sources of financing for\ndevelopment and creating a congenial environment for\nprivate sector activity. Although ODA flows, which\ndecreased in the 1990s, have picked up in recent years,\nthe fact that these flows remain, on average, still far\nbelow internationally agreed targets is a major cause\nfor concern. In this connection, it is pertinent to recall\nthat an additional $50 billion a year in development\nassistance would be required as a minimum to meet the\nMillennium Development Goals. The fundamental\nquestion facing the international community is whether\nit is committed to the indispensable, challenging, but\nultimately rewarding global partnership, which alone\ncan make this dream come true.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global emergency\nand a key threat to achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, especially for countries in sub-\nSaharan Africa. The pandemic has caused untold\nsuffering and death in our countries, destroying entire\ncommunities, reversing development gains and posing\na serious security threat.\nUnfortunately, despite the substantial measures\ntaken by the Government in combating the scourge,\nGhana\u00eds efforts have been severely constrained by a\nlack of adequate resources required to prevent new\ninfections, provide care and support for people,\nparticularly women and children living with\nHIV/AIDS. We wish to urge the international\ncommunity to provide the needed resources for the\nfight against this global emergency.\nGhana attaches great importance to the\nempowerment of women to make them equal partners\nin the formulation and implementation of development\npolicies. Since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration\nand Platform for Action and the outcome of the\ntwenty-third special session of the General Assembly,\ngender equality has been an essential element of\nGhana\u00eds efforts to attain sustainable development. The\nactive involvement of women in political processes and\ndecision-making at all levels and in all sectors is being\nvigorously pursued. Impediments such as discrimination\nand violence against women are being dealt with\nthrough education, advocacy and legislation.\nDespite the strong political will within the\ninternational community to create a world fit for\nchildren, the reality in many parts of the world is a far\ncry from the ideals voiced at the twenty-seventh\nspecial session of the General Assembly, on children.\nWe call for the adoption of effective policies to\neradicate poverty, to ensure access to education and to\nprovide families with support to guarantee the well-\nbeing of children. Decisive international cooperation is\nalso required to strengthen legal and other preventive\nmechanisms to tackle effectively the increasing\npractice of child trafficking for unconscionable\nexploitative purposes.\nGhana believes that the staff of the Organization,\nwho make sacrifices daily to maintain peace and\nsecurity in zones of conflict and humanitarian disaster,\ndeserve to be provided with a secure and safe\n20\n\nenvironment in which to operate. In that regard, we\nwill continue to condemn all attacks against United\nNations personnel and call for firm action by States to\nestablish conditions that prevent such attacks, in\nfulfilment of the obligations of host countries towards\nthe United Nations and its personnel.\nGhana, as a major troop-contributing country,\nwill continue to support United Nations peacekeeping\noperations globally, as well as in Africa. That\ncommitment, which began with our participation in the\nUnited Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960, is born\nof the firm moral conviction in our solidarity for\nhumanity and the knowledge that a lack of peace and\nstability anywhere can be a real threat to peace and\nsecurity for all of us.\nIn conclusion, I urge Member States to rededicate\nthemselves individually and collectively to the ideals\nthat underpin the Organization and provide it with the\ncommensurate resources as it strives to fulfil the\naspirations of the peoples of the world. We cannot,\nshould not and must not fail in that undertaking."

        "file_text": "Samoa warmly\ncongratulates you, Mr. President, on your election to\nsteer the course of the Organization\u2019s work at this\ncritical time in its 59-year history. I know that you will\ncontinue the good work of your predecessor in\nhighlighting the multidimensional nature of\ninternational security and the need to reform the United\nNations so that our Organization responds more\neffectively to the current and emerging challenges\nfacing our world.\nHardly a week goes by without an act of\nterrorism somewhere in the world assailing our senses.\nSuch murderous acts, regardless of the cause or\ngrievance advanced by their perpetrators, are utterly\nindefensible. Many innocent lives continue to be\nwasted, with people killed or maimed and multitudes\ndisplaced by heinous acts designed to undermine and\ndestabilize the collective efforts of the international\ncommunity to achieve peace and security for our\nsocieties. Samoa condemns, in the strongest terms, all\nacts of terrorism and will continue to take actions and\ncontribute our support to the campaign against it.\nBesides terrorism, other scourges to world peace\nand to the stability of our nations persist. The threat of\nweapons of mass destruction, poverty and hunger,\nenvironmental degradation, the trafficking and\nsmuggling of human beings, HIV/AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis are becoming perennial major threats to\nglobal security.\nThe campaign against terrorism can still be\nsuccessful, but not merely by force of arms. Preventing\nsafe havens for terrorists and closing off their sources\nof financing are just as crucial. But no less important is\nthe necessity of addressing the root causes that feed\nterrorism.\nNo sensible administration can fail to be moved\nby the tragedy of Beslan and the humanitarian\ncatastrophe of Darfur. The imperatives for action by\nthe Organization and the international community to\naddress those events and their causes have been\neloquently articulated by leaders who have spoken\nearlier from this rostrum. I wish only to recall and\nemphasize that actions to arrive at solutions to those\nevents and others like them must be carried out in\naccordance with the rule of law.\nWith regard to Iraq, Samoa deplores the daily\nviolence that has killed and maimed so many people\nand the circumstances that have brought it about. We\nfully support the re-establishment of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty,\nand we pray for the success of a credible election\nprocess to create an Iraqi Government with a popular\nmandate.\nLikewise, we can only pray and hope that a\nworkable solution will be found soon for the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, before many more lives are lost on\nboth sides.\nLast month, Samoa hosted, in the capital, Apia,\nthe annual Pacific Islands Forum Summit of leaders.\nAs the representative holding the current chairmanship\nof that group, I wish to inform the Assembly that the\nPacific leaders again noted the dangers to the world of\nterrorism, and \u2014 to the Pacific region, in particular \u2014\nof transnational crime, illicit drugs and the spread of\nsmall arms assault weapons. Consequently, the Pacific\nIslands Forum countries have strengthened their\ncooperation in counter-terrorism measures, as well as\nemphasized national efforts and regional cooperation in\ncombating transnational organized crime and in\nbuilding border-control capacities.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum is also committed to\ncollective arrangements and mechanisms to assist\nregional Governments to recover from national\nconflicts and crises. The success of these arrangements,\nundertaken with the support of the United Nations, is\nalready evident in the positive results of the Regional\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands. While much\nmore remains to be done, Solomon Islands is making\ngood and steady progress, and the Forum will remain\nengaged in sustaining the mission.\nSimilarly, peace has been achieved in\nBougainville, with elections for an autonomous\nBougainville Government to be held by the end of the\nyear. The roles of the Governments of Papua New\nGuinea, Australia and New Zealand, with the support\nof the Pacific Islands Forum, working together with the\n5\n\nUnited Nations Observer Mission, is critical in guiding\nBougainville during this important period.\nAn important feature of the response mechanism\nput in place by the Pacific Islands Forum to assist\nregional Governments is its flexibility. The Pacific\nIslands Forum is now in the process of responding to a\ncrisis in one of our member countries resulting from\ncauses quite different from those in Solomon Islands\nand Bougainville.\nIn recognition of the importance of good\ngovernance for economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment, the Pacific Islands Forum has invited its\nmembers to become parties to the United Nations\nConvention against Corruption. In strengthening\nfurther the institutions of good governance in Pacific\nnations, the important role of non-State actors and civil\nsociety was highlighted by the Pacific leaders.\nOne issue that the Pacific islands have brought to\nthe attention of the United Nations over the years that\nremains relevant \u2014 not only for the Pacific \u2014 and\nthat, very importantly, is advancing the cause of\nnuclear non-proliferation, is that of the South Pacific\nNuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. The Pacific Forum has\nagain called on the United States to ratify the Protocols\nto the Treaty.\nAlthough the Pacific Islands Forum has been\nheavily engaged in overcoming crises with which some\nof the regional Governments are grappling, several\nPacific island nations, in addition to Australia and New\nZealand, have nevertheless been contributing in ways\nwe can to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts. As\nfor my own country, we provide police to the United\nNations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste and\nLiberia, in addition to those we have committed to\nSolomon Islands.\nClearly, our small nations are trying hard to\ncontribute to the security and peace initiatives of the\nUnited Nations. However, national obligations \u2014\nincluding reporting obligations for the various\nconventions and United Nations resolutions on security\nand terrorism \u2014 place an onerous burden on the\ninfrastructure and administrative capacity of small\nStates. We therefore seek the understanding of the\nOrganization and encourage the appropriate United\nNations bodies to explore innovative ways to help\nsmall States meet their commitments.\nMr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair.\nThe challenges to and special needs of small\nisland developing States are well known, and are\nreflected in the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, which has been in place for the past 10 years.\nSadly, despite the commitments made 10 years ago at\nBarbados and during the 1999 mid-term review in this\nHall, the achievement of those goals continues to elude\nus.\nIt is our fervent hope, however, that the\nInternational Meeting due to take place in Mauritius\nnext January to comprehensively review the Barbados\nProgramme of Action will provide an opportunity for\nthe international community to demonstrate the\npolitical will and commit sufficient resources to allow\nour small island developing nations to overcome the\nunique challenges we face.\nThe series of hurricanes that wrought massive\ndevastation in some island nations of the Caribbean\nand in the United States is a stark reminder of the\nextreme challenges faced by small island developing\nStates and of their vulnerability to disasters. Our\nPacific island nations, including my own country,\nknow from our bitter experience of cyclones that\nregularly batter our region about the disheartening\neffect of such disasters in setting back, in a matter of\nhours, the hard-earned development achievements of\nmany years.\nThe concerns and the vulnerability of our nations\nare therefore quite real. While we accept the primary\nresponsibility for achieving the goals of the\nProgramme of Action, the reality is that the support of\nthe international community is indispensable to its\nsuccess. We therefore call on the United Nations\nsystem and the international community to provide the\nnecessary support to complement ongoing and future\nprogrammes, as well as for the implementation and\nmonitoring of the Mauritius outcomes for the\nsustainable development of small island developing\nStates.\nLikewise, the importance of multilateral\ninstitutions such as the Global Environment Facility\n(GEF) in this process cannot be overemphasized. We\ntherefore urge GEF to apply its rules of access and to\nsimplify its disbursement procedures in order to take\n6\n\ninto account the special circumstances of small island\ndeveloping States.\nTrade is a vital component of sustainable\ndevelopment, especially for small island developing\nStates. We therefore continue to urge that the\nvulnerabilities of small States be taken fully into\naccount in the World Trade Organization negotiations,\nparticularly with regard to special and differential\ntreatment for small economies.\nThe review of the Millennium Development\nGoals next year will provide an opportunity for the\ninternational community to take stock of progress and\nto identify remedial strategies and commitments for the\nfurther realization of those Goals. Samoa remains\ncommitted to the achievement of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nThe election of the second Deputy Prosecutor of\nthe International Criminal Court just two weeks ago\ncompletes the process of the full institutionalization of\nthe Court. Samoa warmly welcomes the broad\ncomplement of judges and officers of the Court and\nadds its voice in urging other United Nations Members\nto accede to the Rome Statute for the establishment of\nthe Court. Given its role in upholding international\nhumanitarian standards and in protecting human rights,\nthe Court deserves the support of the international\ncommunity to give it the full universality it requires.\nWe thank the Secretary-General and the previous\nPresident of the Assembly for their very commendable\nwork in advancing the revitalization and reform of the\nOrganization.\nTo this end, Samoa fully supports the work of the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\nand looks forward to its report at the end of the year.\nWe believe that the outcome of United Nations\nreform should include the restoration of the primacy of\nthe role of the General Assembly and the attainment of\na more effective and efficient Secretariat.\nIn particular, we support the enlargement of the\nSecurity Council and strongly recommend the\ninclusion of Japan and Germany as permanent\nmembers.\nFinally, I offer Mr. Ping my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport in the discharge of his numerous\nresponsibilities, and I wish him well in his presidency."

At the\ndawn of the millennium those questions are becoming\nincreasingly burning issues. The world has changed.\nThe pendulum of history has swung to the other side.\nThere is new violence, a wave of terrorism, local wars\nand ethnic conflicts, behind which lie growing poverty\nand a widening gap in development between countries.\nThose are not just someone else\u2019s problems; they are\ncommon global challenges for all of us. What kind of\ncommon house do we want? I believe that we primarily\nwant a safe house, where our children will not die at\nthe hands of terrorists or from hunger, sickness, anti-\npersonnel mines, smart bombs or missiles.\nWhat, then, must we do? The answer is clear: we\nmust establish a valid system of international security\nthat includes military, economic, environmental, social\nand information elements \u2014 a system based on the rule\nof law in domestic and international affairs. The\nanswer is clear, but it is difficult to do it. During the\nAssembly\u2019s last session, Belarus made the rule of law\nin international relations the main focus of its\nstatement. The fact that that theme has been a leitmotif\nof the present general debate inspires a certain hope in\nus, namely, that the goal is a realistic one.\nNo right-thinking person can remain indifferent\ntoday to the heinous acts of terrorism that have\ncharacterized the start of the twenty-first century. The\nusual approaches, based on selfishness and unilateral\nadvantage, are not enough to crush this evil. We need\nnon-traditional, long-term, comprehensive solutions.\nWho can provide them, and how? Only the United\nNations, by playing its crucial role, can do so. The\nSecurity Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee\n(CTC) must become a real, practical tool for curbing\nthe growth in international terrorism: strengthening the\nanti-terrorism coalition under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, monitoring the implementation of the\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\nand putting an end to the practice of double standards\nvis-\u00e0-vis terrorists and terrorism.\nIn practical terms, establishing a direct link\nbetween the CTC and regional organizations and\nholding more open Security Council meetings at the\nministerial level could really help in the global struggle\nagainst terrorism, under the banner of the United\nNations. However, such a struggle can be successful\nonly if our common goal is to strengthen a just and\nhumane world system. Belarus will do its utmost in\nthat struggle.\nOn 1 March 2004, the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction entered into force in Belarus. We have the\nworld\u2019s seventh largest stockpile of landmines, which\nwe inherited from the former Soviet Union. We do not\nproduce or export mines; nor do we use them at home\nor anywhere else in the world. However, guided by our\ncommon concerns and interests, we ratified the Ottawa\nConvention and are now counting on assistance from\nthe international community to destroy our stockpile of\nmines.\nTomorrow we will deposit my country\u2019s\ninstruments of ratification for such important\ninternational disarmament agreements as the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism and the Protocol against the\nIllicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,\nTheir Parts and Components and Ammunition,\nsupplementing the United Nations Convention against\nTransnational Organized Crime.\nToday\u2019s most important challenges include illegal\nmigration, transborder crime, drug trafficking,\ntrafficking in persons and the security of energy\ninfrastructure. In combating those threats, Belarus,\n16\n\nwhich stands at a major European crossroads, is a\nsignificant factor in the stability of Europe. Our\ncountry is also playing a major role in the Europe-Asia\ntransport of energy resources. Today we call on our\nneighbours, NATO and the European Union to organize\nregional cooperation to ensure the security of critical\ninfrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines and power\nstations, including nuclear ones. Belarus has already\nannounced its readiness to dedicate troops and\nresources to international structures in support of those\ngoals. The contribution of Belarus to regional and\ninternational security, which began in the areas of\nnuclear and conventional disarmament in the early\n1990s, continues to be a real and significant one. We\nare grateful to other countries and to international\norganizations for their assistance in the area of border\nand customs infrastructure.\nDouble standards are becoming an increasingly\nimportant problem, and not only vis-\u00e0-vis terrorism.\nThat objectionable instrument is being used primarily\nagainst States that are bold enough to follow their own\nforeign policy, rather than submitting to the dictates of\nthe world\u2019s power centres. A leader is not a dictator,\nand certainly not a messiah. The practice of double\nstandards today applies primarily to the Euro-Atlantic\nspace. But strenuous efforts are being made to\nintroduce it in the United Nations. That would present\na danger to the stability and effectiveness of the United\nNations system. Belarus calls on all States that are not\nindifferent to the independence of the United Nations\nand to the role it plays not to allow that to happen.\nEconomic security is a very important condition\nfor sustainable development. That is a very remote\nconcept for most of the countries of the world. As the\nonly European State that is a member of the Non-\nAligned Movement, Belarus would like to stress that\nthe concept of centre versus periphery pits developed\ncountries against developing countries in the industrial\narena. It is also a concept that is clearly in crisis, and\none that will slow us down in the search for a solution\nto problems of economic development.\nOnly seven of the 50 least developed countries\nhave achieved a 7 per cent growth rate, which is\nprerequisite to halving the number of people living in\nabsolute poverty by the year 2015. One person dies of\nhunger every four seconds. That is just a figure, but the\nvery banality of that statement does reveal the\nmonstrosity of the problem and how terrible is the\nworld\u2019s indifference to it. The difficulty of the\nundertaking should not stop us from seeking ways to\nresolve the problem of poverty. That is why Belarus\nsupports President Lula da Silva\u2019s initiative to fight\nhunger and poverty in the world.\nDespite the transitional period and the collapse of\nour economy, my country \u2014 a large area of the former\nSoviet Union \u2014 was the first to solve the problem of\nmalnutrition. Now, we are waging a struggle against\npoverty. Since 1995, we have almost halved the\nnumber of people living in poverty in Belarus, with the\nfigure this year being about 20 per cent.\nThe difficulties we have experienced have not\nstopped us from providing economic assistance to\ndeveloping countries. We have unilaterally extended\ntrade preferences to the overwhelming majority of\ndeveloping countries.\nWe are disturbed by a possible lessening of\nUnited Nations attention to issues involving countries\nwith economies in transition. Belarus regards the role\nof United Nations programmes and funds as important\nto the development assistance provided to countries\nwith economies in transition. However, under current\nconditions \u2014 in which some States of the region are\napproaching the level of the Group of Eight (G-8) and\nothers have macroeconomic indicators that barely\nexceed those of least developed countries \u2014 that\nassistance must be carefully targeted. That means that,\nin planning country programmes, account must be\ntaken of countries\u2019 socio-economic development and\nthe degree of their integration into the world economy\nand financial institutions. We intend to make that\napproach the basis of a draft General Assembly\nresolution, and we hope that members will support it.\nThe problems associated with financing for\ndevelopment are extremely topical today for\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\ntransition. Last year\u2019s two-day High-Level Dialogue on\nFinancing for Development was not enough to put in\nplace ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the\ndecisions of the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development. That will require an independent\nbody of the Economic and Social Council.\nBelarus believes that the 2005 New York summit\non the implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals will provide real impetus to all initiatives aimed\nat stimulating economic development.\n17\n\nNarrowing the technological and information\ndivide between developed and developing countries\nmust be our common concern.\nAt the 2003 Geneva World Summit on the\nInformation Society, the President of the Republic of\nBelarus, Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, strongly urged\nthe establishment of a trust fund to offset losses\nincurred by producers who provide software to\ndeveloping countries at reduced costs. The format and\nmechanism for such a fund should be defined by a task\nforce within the context of preparing for the 2005\nsummit.\nHaving experienced the Chernobyl disaster,\nBelarus is acutely aware of one fact: we cannot\ndisregard the problem of radiation security. The\nconsequences are too enormous in scope, and too\nincompatible with the long-term survival of the human\nrace. The United Nations must not lessen its attention\nto the problem of overcoming the consequences of the\nChernobyl accident. We support the work of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to implement a\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and to strengthen\nnuclear and radiation security.\nLooking to the future to seek ways to ensure\nnormal living conditions for people living in areas\naffected by the Chernobyl disaster: that will be the\ntheme of an international conference to be held in\nMinsk in 2006, on the sad anniversary of the\nChernobyl disaster. We invite all interested States, the\nleadership of the Secretariat and international\norganizations to participate in the preparations for the\nconference and in the event itself.\nThe United Nations has often been criticized.\nThere have been many pessimistic analyses of its work\nand its potential. A great deal of that has been fair, but\nlet us look the truth straight in the eyes: there is no\nalternative to the United Nations as a mechanism for\ncollectively resolving global and regional issues. Nor is\nthere an alternative to multilateralism. The reality of\nlife convinces us of that more and more each day.\nBelarus looks forward with great interest to the\noutcome of the work of the High-Level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change. As a member of the\nNon-Aligned Movement, Belarus urges the Panel to\ntake account of the consolidated position of the\ncountries members of the Non-Aligned Movement as it\nworks on its proposals to enhance the effectiveness of\nUnited Nations reform.\nA key purpose of that work must be to correct the\nimbalance in the membership of the Security Council\nand in the Organization as a whole, as well as to\npromote respect for the principle of equitable\ngeographical distribution of Council seats. We believe\nthere should be an increase in the category of non-\npermanent members, taking account of the interests of\nall the regional groups. We also believe in increasing\nthe number of permanent members, including\nrepresentatives from the three developing regions \u2014\nAsia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean \u2014\nas well as from two developed States, from Europe and\nAsia respectively, that have made the most tangible\ncontributions to the maintenance of international peace\nand security.\nLet me return to the disturbing questions I posed\nat the beginning of my statement. Where is the world\nheading? Where is the United Nations going? The\nanswer to the first question must be that it depends\nupon the United Nations. That is the main point. So far,\nhowever, that has not been reflected in the world\nsituation. That is a harsh truth, but the truth\nnonetheless. We must change that situation. We can do\nso. It is in our common interest and in the interest of\nsmall and large States alike, as well as of both rich and\ndeveloping countries. It is in the interest of the United\nNations."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. May I\nalso pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert\nHunte of Saint Lucia, for having ably presided over our\ndeliberations during the previous session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nEven as I speak, a magnificent transformation is\nbeing completed on the other side of the globe \u2014 in\nmy country. Many of us in Indonesia have waited all\nour lives to witness this historic event: our people\nfinally rising to take their destiny into their own hands.\nExactly a week ago, some 125 million men and\nwomen trooped to the polling stations and chose the\nPresident and Vice-President who will govern in the\nname of 230 million Indonesians. That was the third\nnational political exercise that we had to carry out \u2014\nnot just once, but three times \u2014 in a period of six\nmonths, the previous two being the parliamentary\nelections and the first round of the presidential\nelections. All of them were peaceful, fair and\ndemocratic.\nEach of them was an enormous operation,\ncovering some 6,000 islands in an archipelago with an\nexpanse as wide as Europe\u2019s, and involving millions of\nelection workers attending to some 575,000 polling\nstations. As we coped with the massive logistical\nrequirements of that undertaking, we were extended\nsupport and assistance by the United Nations and\nfriendly countries. We are grateful for this.\nIt will be some time before the official results of\nthe vote are in. But whoever the new national leaders\nof Indonesia may be, they will have a clear and strong\nmandate from the people \u2014 not from the elite, not\nfrom the party bosses, nor from power brokers or\nvested interests \u2014 but from the people. This is the\nclimax of a transition from authoritarian rule to a full-\nfledged democracy, a process that began six years ago\nin the crucible of the Asian crisis, which devastated our\neconomy and mangled our socio-political system. We\nhave thus become the full-fledged democracy that the\nfounding fathers of our Republic long ago envisioned.\nThis need for political reform is also felt by other\nnations. The Emir of Qatar, speaking as Chairman of\nthe Group of 77, told this Assembly at its 3rd meeting,\n\u201cPolitical reform and people\u2019s participation in\ndecision-making are no longer an option but have\nbecome a definite necessity\u201d.\nHence, we are proud of this democracy of ours. It is the\nfulfilment of a universal human aspiration, and yet it is\nunique to us. It sprang from our native soil, a true child\nof our culture. It was not imposed from outside, at\ngunpoint. And it put to rest the debate on whether\nIslam and democracy can ever mix.\nAs the country with the largest Muslim\npopulation, Indonesia has proven that Islam can be a\nbastion of democracy and social justice. Indeed, our\ndeep sense of spirituality inspired our people to\nresoundingly reject money politics, corruption,\nterrorism and all forms of extremism. It was also our\nbeacon towards reform; and reform has worked for us.\nAlthough the Asian crisis instantly doubled the number\nof Indonesians living below the poverty line, we have\nsince been able to reduce the poverty rate to its pre-\ncrisis level. We did this by shifting from a\nGovernment-driven poverty-reduction strategy to one\nof community empowerment. This effort required\nfunding of more than US$1 billion, making it one of\nthe largest such programmes in the world.\nThrough fiscal controls that dramatically lowered\ninflation, we stabilized the prices of essential goods.\nThrough social safety net programmes, we helped the\npoor to weather the crisis. By doing this, we denied the\nterrorists what could have been a dangerous mass base.\nSince then, consumer confidence has led our\neconomic growth. With political fears allayed and\ninvestor confidence boosted, we look forward to 4.8\nper cent growth this year, and 5.5 per cent next year.\nWe can now wage a stronger battle against poverty.\nBy consolidating our efforts to promote the rule\nof law, greater respect for human rights and effective\nregional autonomy as the main pillars of our reform,\nwe are confident that we can overcome threats to our\nnational unity and security, including communal\nviolence, separatism and terrorism.\nWe continue to strengthen our relations with all\nour neighbours. We have made a fresh start with\nTimor-Leste, and we are building a strong relationship.\n13\n\nWe look forward to a future of bilateral peace,\nfriendship and cooperation.\nThis does not mean that we have solved all our\nproblems. We still have to make democracy work for\nus some more and to keep it working. This is what 230\nmillion Indonesians devoutly wish, and they deserve no\nless. Moreover, no democracy is safe without being\nassured of a democratic environment at the global\nlevel. That environment cannot be created by unilateral\naction, no matter how mighty and well-intended.\nAt the global level, democracy can be promoted\nonly by democratic means, through multilateral\ninstitutions like the United Nations. If, as its detractors\nsay, the United Nations is not an effective tool of\ncollective security and development, this is only\nbecause it has been denied the support that it deserves\nfrom its strongest and most influential Members.\nBut we need the United Nations to give\nlegitimacy to the necessary use of force in the cause of\ncollective security. And even the wealthiest nations in\nthe world cannot bear all the costs of global security.\nThe privilege and burden of decision-making must be\nshared by all.\nHence, we must empower the United Nations to\nserve as the effective tool of multilateralism that it was\nalways meant to be. We must reform the United\nNations comprehensively, including the Security\nCouncil, by making it more democratic, in terms of\nprocedure and representation, in order to reflect today\u2019s\ngeographical realities.\nIn this regard, it may be recalled that Australia\nlast year proposed the inclusion of Indonesia as a\npermanent member on the Council. We appreciate\nAustralia\u2019s position. It has greatly encouraged us. As\nthe world\u2019s third largest pluralistic democracy, the\nfourth most populous country, the world\u2019s largest\nMuslim nation, a country of tremendous cultural\ndiversity and a member with a track record of serving\nin various peace initiatives of the United Nations,\nIndonesia has an important global constituency on the\nCouncil.\nIndonesia has served in more than 30\npeacekeeping missions, starting with the very first, in\nthe Middle East in 1957. Today, Indonesian soldiers\nand military observers are deployed in peacekeeping\nmissions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nSierra Leone, Liberia and Georgia. As a founding\nmember and active player of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, the Group of 77, the Group of 15, the\nDeveloping Eight and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, our commitment to the promotion of\ninternational peace and understanding is self-evident.\nIndonesia has made key contributions to the\npeaceful resolution of conflicts in its region, notably in\nCambodia and southern Philippines. It continues to\nactively build peace and stability in the region.\nA developing world striving not only for social\nand economic progress but also for democratization\nmust have a voice on the Security Council. Moderate\nIslam must have a voice on the Council. Indonesia\nwould be that voice. And that voice will insist \u2014 as we\nnow insist \u2014 that the fight against terrorism, like the\nrelated fight against poverty, can be won. This is not to\ndeny that terrorists are still capable of wreaking havoc\non our societies. Just two weeks ago, they struck again\nin the heart of Jakarta, killing nine innocent civilians\nand wounding 150 others. We in Indonesia condemn\nthis act of inhuman savagery, mourn the loss of\ninnocent life and share the pain and anger of the\nwounded and the bereaved families. But we are by no\nmeans intimidated. We will bring the perpetrators to\njustice as we have always done after every terrorist\nattack.\nOur faith remains firm that the fight against terror\ncan be won. The world can be made immensely safer.\nBut the global coalition to defeat terrorism must be\ninclusive. It must be multilateral and democratic. It\nmust empower the moderates of the world. And it must\naddress the root causes of terrorism: the grievances and\nthe poignant sense of injustice that drive human beings\nto such depths of despair that they would carry out the\nmost heinous acts of mass murder and destruction. It\nmust address grievances due to a poverty that is the\noffshoot of social and economic inequity, the affronts\nof tyranny and corruption, and the failure of States to\ndeliver a standard of living that befits human dignity.\nIncluded are grievances due to political oppression,\nsuch as the aggression and brutalities that the\nPalestinian people continue to suffer in the hands of the\noccupying Power.\nFor the coalition that would fight terrorism and\npoverty to be truly multilateral and democratic, it must\ninclude the regional organizations, which are\nenvisioned in the United Nations Charter as the pillars\nof global multilateralism.\n14\n\nThe United Nations itself, in extending assistance\nand services to countries all over the world, needs\nsupport at the regional level. This is why we in the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\nstriving to develop a robust partnership with the world\nOrganization. We are confident that this partnership\nwill prosper, as ASEAN evolves into a true community\nby the year 2020. As a security community, we will\nassume full responsibility for our security and political\nstability. As an economic and sociocultural community,\nwe will be a stronger force for development and social\nintegration in the Asia-Pacific region.\nTogether with our counterparts in two continents,\nwe are building a bridge of cooperation across the\nIndian Ocean to form a partnership for development. A\nsummit of Asian and African nations will formally\nestablish this strategic partnership in April 2005 in\nJakarta.\nAt the same time, the summit will pay tribute to a\nwatershed event in the cause of equitable international\nrelations. Thus, we will observe the Golden Jubilee of\nthe Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in\n1955. Moreover, ASEAN is networking in all\ndirections, with its counterparts in the rest of the Asia-\nPacific region, in Latin America and in Europe. We\nexpect this network of regional organizations, in\npartnership with the United Nations, to be the ultimate\nform of multilateralism. This network can also help\nadvance a global democratic agenda. To this end, Asia\ncan make a significant contribution.\nToday Asia is certainly in the midst of a\ndemocratic flowering. A series of successful\ndemocratic elections in various Asian countries in\nrecent months has been hailed worldwide as a political\nmiracle that may be of deeper significance than the\nshort-lived Asian economic miracle a decade ago.\nBut democracy is never a miracle \u2014 never a gift,\nnor something imposed. It is always hard-earned and\noften the fruit of many sacrifices. And its ultimate\nworth depends entirely upon us, the people \u2014 on\nwhether we have the political maturity, the wisdom and\nthe courage to make it work and make it endure. We in\nIndonesia are devoutly committed to that end."

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that your wisdom,\ndrawn from the positions of your friendly country of\nGabon, will stand you in good stead in promoting\ndialogue among the peoples and the countries of the\nworld, in invigorating the role of the United Nations\nand in preserving its Charter.\nI also express my appreciation, Sir, to your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for his efforts to bring\nthe previous session to a successful conclusion.\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\nthe Secretary-General for his patience and efforts to\nmake the voice of the United Nations heard in a\nprecarious international situation, amid volatile\nregional conditions, in which force is preferred to law,\nwrong preferred to right and war preferred to peace.\nOur world has been going through extremely difficult\ntimes since 11 September 2001. That is particularly\ntrue of the United States and the Middle East. The\n5\n\nUnited Nations could have very well shared the fate of\nthe League of Nations in the 1930s, although very little\nthought was given to the dire consequences that such a\ndevelopment would have entailed, given the absence of\nother alternatives.\nIt is no exaggeration to argue that the major\nchallenges today to the questions of peace, security and\ndevelopment stem not only from failing to heed the\nUnited Nations Charter but also from manipulating\nsome of its Articles to greatly disrupt and derail\ninternational relations and to deliberately upset the\ninternational equilibrium that we inherited from the\ncold war era.\nThus, it becomes clear that the surge in\nextremism, the diversity of its causes and\nmanifestations and the spread of poverty and hunger\nacross large parts of the world are not the concern of\nonly one country, one people or one religion, but,\nrather, of all peoples, countries and religions of the\nworld.\nIt is also clear that this deteriorating situation,\nwhich the international community acknowledges but\nhas failed to strive in earnest to remedy, will not serve\nanyone in particular. This is all the more true now that\nthe justifications of the cold war era, with its enormous\nexpenses on armaments, can no longer be invoked and\nthat pre-emptive wars, with the great losses in life and\nproperty they entail, have proven useless. The mistakes\ncommitted during the world war on terror, regardless of\nwhether they were committed in good faith or in bad\nfaith, have worked as a call to promote and practice\nterrorism, which has been embraced by an enemy\nwhose whereabouts we do not know. This enemy is\ncommitting acts so horrific that they remind us of the\nMiddle Ages.\nIn this context, the peoples of the developing\ncountries are wondering why hundreds of fighter jets\nand thousands of soldiers would be hauled across the\ncontinents and why billions of dollars would be spent\nto bring about a regime change in certain countries\nwhen those resources could have been channelled \u2014\neven partially \u2014 into financing education and\ndevelopment projects in those same countries? When\nreform becomes a national and an international\ndemand, how can we justify to those seeking reform\nthe fact that the movers and the shakers of the world\nchose to impose sanctions instead of investing in peace\nand prosperity and chose to spend billions on war\ninstead of opting for the road that would surely lead to\nreform and progress? Is it possible to prove that\nthroughout history military solutions, and not political\nor economic solutions, have been more effective tools\nfor reform and progress and for saving the lives of\nmillions of people plagued by injustice, poverty and\ndisease? At any rate, while political solutions may not\nnecessarily guarantee full success, military solutions\nare definitely a recipe for failure.\nMoreover, while such an argument may sound\nidealistic, there can be no alternative to political\nsolutions. The current international dilemma is\nexacerbated by military solutions. There are many\nexamples to prove that argument. We can cite, by way\nof example, the situations in Iraq, Afghanistan and\nother places.\nLeft alone, that dilemma will not be solved. It can\nonly be solved if the leaders of the world work in\nearnest and evince the necessary political will to\nrestore credibility to the United Nations and guarantee\nrespect for international legitimacy through their\ncommitment to United Nations resolutions that are\nbased on the principles and purposes of the Charter.\nJustice and equality, it must be recalled, are at the core\nof the Charter of this Organization.\nThe peoples of the world were optimistic about\nthe great strides that were made in science and\ntechnology and the collective and individual\nachievements that spanned all fields of human\nendeavour in the past two decades. They aspired to a\nglobalization with a human face that was based on a\ndialogue among civilizations, and synergies with other\ncultures, that would keep the spectre of cold and hot\nwars at bay. However, some power circles attempted to\nexploit those great human achievements to further their\nown narrow interests. They devised new colonialist\npolicies that disappointed the peoples of the world and\nturned back the clock.\nAt the speed of light, the world forgot about the\nsurge of optimism that overwhelmed many of the\nworld\u2019s leaders as they addressed this Assembly four\nyears ago when they celebrated the third Millennium.\nToday, a wave of pessimism has taken over the world\nbecause of extremist and intolerant policies advanced\nby some strategic think-tanks that were determined to\nfind a new enemy, under any pretext, after the fall of\nthe Soviet Union.\n6\n\nIsrael has contributed to the creation of many of\nthose flimsy pretexts. It has packaged them with great\ncare, breathed life into many of them, and distributed\nthem among the delegations that owe allegiance to it. It\nwas hoping to achieve the following: first, to incite the\nAmericans in particular and the West in general to\nwage endless wars in the Middle East, in order to\nunderscore the old-new theory of Israel that the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict is not the core of the problems of the\nregion. To prove our point we refer to the argument\npromoted by Israel that the situation in Iraq and its\nrepercussions are more dangerous and complicated\nthan that prevailing in the occupied Arab territories and\nPalestine. Sharon is trying to mislead world public\nopinion into believing that achieving peace would\nrequire only the dismantling of some Jewish settler\noutposts in Gaza, not withdrawal from the West Bank\nand the occupied Palestinian territories, let alone\nwithdrawal from East Jerusalem and accepting a just\nsolution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees.\nSecondly, Israel hoped to divert the attention of\nthe world and camouflage the settlement activities in\nthe occupied Arab territories that have continued\nunabated, while continuing to build the racist\nsegregation wall and lessening the importance of State\nterror perpetrated by Israel on a daily basis. Israel has\nrepackaged its policies as an act of self-defence that\ndoes not warrant condemnation and denunciation even\nthough it targets innocent civilians.\nBut Israel has not fully succeeded in realizing its\ngoals, and even where it has, that success will be short-\nlived because Israel has in recent years transformed its\nregular army into gangs bent on committing systematic\nkillings and war crimes against Palestinian civilians,\nall perpetrated in the territories it occupies in the West\nBank and Gaza. Killing the Palestinians often occurs in\nthe course of house demolitions that terrorize their\nwretched occupants, who frequently look death in the\neye.\nAll this notwithstanding, the defenceless\nPalestinians have stayed the course and refused to\nsurrender or leave. Israel bears an important share of\nthe responsibility for the intensification and worsening\nof the American predicament in Iraq by avoiding the\nresumption of the peace process despite the hand\nextended to it in peace by the Palestinians, Syrians, and\nLebanese.\nI must repeat that Israel bears an important share\nof the responsibility for the intensification and\nworsening of the American predicament in Iraq owing\nto its failure to resume the peace process. The Israeli\ncourse of action may come back to haunt it because its\ncontinued occupation of the Arab lands is a major\ncause of the rejection of American policies in the\nbroader Middle East.\nThat is also true in Europe where polls conducted\na year ago showed that most of the citizens of the\nEuropean Union believe that Israel poses a threat to\ninternational peace.\nAmong the strategic mistakes committed by the\nthink-tanks and research centres that owe their\nallegiance to Israel is to mislead the Israelis into\nbelieving that the new Iraq will hasten to conclude\npeace agreements with Israel and establish diplomatic\nrelations with it before it withdraws from the occupied\nArab territories. They ignored the fact that the Iraqis\nrefused to adopt the new flag that was designed for\ntheir country after the war simply because its colours\nsomehow bear resemblance to the Israeli flag.\nThe deteriorating situation in Iraq remains a\nsource of great concern for my country and other\ncountries in the region and the world. That state of\naffairs should prompt all of us to mobilize all efforts to\nwin the battle for peace in post-war Iraq.\nSyria, a neighbouring country directly concerned\nwith events in Iraq \u2014 given our historic and\ngeographical ties as well as our common national\nbonds with the Iraqi people \u2014 has spared no effort to\nguarantee Iraq\u2019s stability, security, independence,\nterritorial integrity and the unity of its people. We\nstand ready to cooperate with the neighbouring\ncountries and all the parties concerned, including the\nUnited Nations, to enable the Iraqi people to govern\nthemselves, manage their resources and establish\noptimal relations with their neighbours.\nSyria has repeatedly declared its commitment to a\njust and comprehensive peace. We continue to call for\nthe withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories\noccupied in 1967, for guaranteeing the legitimate rights\nof the Palestinian people, including their right to\nestablish their own independent State with Jerusalem\nas its capital, in accordance with the resolutions of\ninternational legitimacy, namely, Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the Madrid\n7\n\nterms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiative\nendorsed by the Beirut summit of 2002.\nThat was the basis of Syria\u2019s serious engagement\nin the peace negotiations for over a decade. The\nliterature published on the subject recently in the\nUnited States and Israel bears witness to the\nseriousness with which Syria approached those\nnegotiations. What the peace process lacks today is a\nstrategic Israeli decision comparable to the Syrian\ndecision to achieve peace in the region.\nIt was rather disparaging that the Foreign\nMinister of Israel used this rostrum of international\nlegitimacy to ignore the facts and selectively refer to a\nresolution recently adopted by the Security Council on\nLebanon. Israel violates Lebanese airspace, territorial\nwaters, land borders and sovereignty on a daily basis\nand continues to occupy parts of Lebanese territory.\nThe representative of Israel tried, in vain, to\nmisguide the international community. The world\ncommunity today bears witness to Israel\u2019s persistent\nnon-compliance with 40 Security Council and 600\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, all of which call upon\nIsrael to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories\nso that a just and comprehensive peace can be\nestablished in the region. Soon after the adoption of\nevery resolution Israel would reject it, levelling\naccusations and heaping insults on the Organization. It\nhas refused to allow entry to members of fact-finding\nmissions, and has even harassed them. Given all those\nfacts, does anyone have the right to ask whether the\nstatements by the representative of Israel mark the\nbeginning of a radical change in the position of his\nGovernment, perhaps indicating the pursuit of a policy\nthat respects international legitimacy and is committed\nto compliance with its resolutions?\nFor centuries our region has endured more\nforeign threats and onslaughts, acts of aggression,\nmisrepresentations of facts and use of force against our\npeoples than any other region. Its potential has been\nwasted and its material and intellectual resources\nsquandered, thus preventing it from attaining its\ndevelopment goals and advancing its capacities. The\nMiddle East suffers an explosive situation brought\nabout by Israeli\u2019s expansionist policies, continued\noccupation and virtual sabotage of any chance for\npeace in the region. Furthermore, Israel\u2019s acquisition of\na nuclear arsenal constitutes a major destabilizing\nfactor in the Middle East region that threatens the\nfuture of its peoples.\nSyria was among the first countries of the region\nto call for declaring the Middle East region a zone free\nof all weapons of mass destruction, in particular\nnuclear weapons. We have seriously worked to attain\nthat objective. We have joined the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) and concluded a comprehensive\nsafeguards agreement with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA). We have also contributed to\nnumerous initiatives to attain that goal, most recently\nthrough the draft resolution we submitted on behalf of\nthe Arab Group to the Security Council on\n29 December 2003 (see A/58/667, annex). The draft\nresolution called for the establishment of a zone free of\nall weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East\nregion, in particular nuclear weapons, in the context of\na collective international monitoring regime under\nUnited Nations supervision, which would enhance the\nrole of multilateral international disarmament\nconventions.\nInternational terrorism is a cause for concern for\nus all. Together we should work to eradicate that\ndangerous phenomenon by addressing its root causes.\nIt is on this basis that Syria has condemned terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations. We condemn the\nkidnapping and killing of innocent people and the\ntargeting of civilians, government institutions,\nhumanitarian agencies, religious establishments,\ninternational organizations and diplomatic missions.\nIn that context, we reiterate our condemnation of\nthe heinous terrorist act that killed innocent children in\na school in Beslan, Russia. We also call on the\ninternational community to condemn the systematic\nState terror perpetrated by Israel in the occupied\nPalestinian territories against the defenceless\nPalestinian people, as well as the many massacres\nperpetrated by Israeli occupation forces, in which\ninnocent children, women and the elderly are killed.\nDuring its tenure on the Security Council, Syria\nstrove to support the Council\u2019s efforts to combat\ninternational terrorism. It has acceded to most of the\ninternational counter-terrorism conventions as well as\nto the Arab and Organization of the Islamic Conference\nanti-terrorism conventions. The two latter conventions\ndefine crimes of terrorism and distinguish between\nterrorism and the legitimate right of occupied peoples\n8\n\nto resist occupation in accordance with international\nlaw and the United Nations Charter.\nMy country is following with great concern the\ndevelopments in the brotherly Sudan. That concern\nstems primarily from our commitment to the territorial\nintegrity of the Sudan and the unity of its people. We\nview with satisfaction the positions and measures\nadopted by the Government of the Sudan to address the\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur. We believe that the\nLeague of Arab States and the African Union can play\nan important role in the settlement of the crisis.\nSyria welcomes the increased role of the African\nUnion in seeking effective solutions to the major issues\nfacing the countries and the peoples of Africa. We\nbelieve that the African Union\u2019s conflict settlement\nmechanisms, including its Peace and Security Council,\nwill strengthen the role of that important continent and\nits ability to face the challenges of peace and\ndevelopment.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\nunderscored the need to create an environment\nfavourable to development and to eradicate poverty at\nthe national and global levels. Have we acted upon\nthose commitments? How far have we gone on the road\ntowards implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals? Have we taken the necessary\nsteps and cooperated far enough to give the necessary\nimpetus to efforts towards progress in the entire\ndeveloping world?\nDevelopment is a human right to which every\nhuman being is entitled. It is not an exclusive privilege\navailable to one side to the detriment of the other,\nregardless of the disparities between them. That right\nshould be accorded priority status on our agenda, and it\nmust not be manipulated for political gains.\nIt is heartening to note that some enlightened\nleaders have taken it upon themselves to shed light on\ntwo of the most critical problems of our world: poverty\nand hunger. In launching the Action Against Hunger\nand Poverty, they proposed practical collective\nsolutions to preserve man\u2019s dignity. Syria welcomes the\nDeclaration issued by the world leaders in response to\nthe initiative of the Brazilian President to discuss that\nquestion.\nSyria has effectively contributed to the debate on\nthe reform of the United Nations system, the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform\nof the Security Council and the increase of its\nmembership. Syria hopes that, at this session, the\nAssembly will continue to address the urgent questions\nof peace and development so that a broad consensus\nwill emerge and coordinated measures will be adopted\ntowards resolving those questions. The prime objective\nof reforming the United Nations is to enhance its\nability to face the new threats and challenges.\nHowever, reform should be built on commitment to the\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter.\nSyria is following with keen interest the work of\nthe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General to review\ncurrent and future threats to international peace and\nsecurity and the current state of affairs of the main\norgans of the United Nations, with a view to submitting\nproposals on enhancing their roles. Syria will be\nparticipating in the deliberations among Member States\non the proposals and opinions of the Panel.\nAs we have made clear in past years, Syria\nsupports reforming the Security Council and increasing\nits membership. In our view, that reform should be\nbased on the principles of universality, effectiveness,\ndemocratic participation and geographical\nrepresentation, particularly of developing countries.\nSyria has consistently stressed the importance of\nassigning a permanent seat on the Security Council to\nthe Arab States, to be allocated by rotation among the\nMember States in accordance with the procedures of\nthe League of Arab States.\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has\nsuccessfully overcome many acute regional and\ninternational crises. Its Charter has had to coexist with\nsome of those crises. At times, the United Nations has\ndealt with those crises successfully. At other times, it\nhas skirted them without actually coming to grips with\nthem. A case in point is the Palestinian question, which\nis as old as the United Nations itself. The Arab-Israeli\nconflict still rages in spite of the fact that the United\nNations has adopted more than 600 resolutions on the\nsubject. Israel, however, has not implemented a single\none of these resolutions and continues to find\nprotection both inside and outside the United Nations.\nA lot has been said about establishing a greater\nMiddle East. We are convinced that success in\nachieving that will remain elusive unless the relevant\nresolutions are implemented and peace is restored, in\n9\n\naccordance with the aspirations of the people of the\nregion and the world."

        "file_text": "Although protocol requires that our statements be brief,\nit is no matter of routine for Equatorial Guinea to\ncongratulate Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of Foreign Affairs\nof the Gabonese Republic, on his well-deserved\nelection to guide the work of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth regular session.\nWe congratulate you, Mr. President, because,\nfirst, it is right that the voice of the oppressed and\nmarginalized that you represent should be heard loud\nand clear by the international community. Secondly, we\nwould like also to encourage you, because the task\nfacing you personally and your country, the Gabonese\nRepublic, is to coordinate \u2014 and to endeavour to\nreconcile \u2014 the varied and opposing interests that exist\nin this unipolar, artificial and fragile world, where few\nspeak out, others say nothing or only listen, and yet\nothers speak, but to no effect.\nThe task is difficult, because we need to rebuild\nthe international authority that has been taken away\nfrom the United Nations. We can do this only if there is\na spirit of honesty, individual and collective\nresponsibility, and goodwill on the part of Member\nStates, so that selfish interests can be put aside in the\ncommon fight to ensure the primacy of the principles\nand objectives of this world Organization, which are\npositive and universal.\nMr. President, you will always be able to count\non the support and ongoing cooperation of my country,\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, in ensuring that\nyour work is fruitful and benefits humankind.\nWe express our eternal gratitude to Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, Secretary-General of this Organization, who at\nall times has been equal to the circumstances and who\nhas dealt with caution, impartiality and justice with the\nissues that have come to the attention of the\nOrganization over the course of this year. We reiterate\nour confidence in him and assure him of our\ncooperation in the task of strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations.\nEquatorial Guinea is participating in the work of\nthe General Assembly at this session with deep concern\nbecause of the dangers and threats posed by the\nmethods used by more powerful countries in\nintervening in the affairs of less protected nations, such\nas my own. We believe that the United Nations has still\nnot fulfilled its primary objective of guaranteeing\ninternational peace and security. We are living in times\nof serious upheaval in various parts of the world,\nbrought about by the anarchy that currently\ncharacterizes international relations.\nEquatorial Guinea will join its efforts with those\nof the international community in order to strengthen\nthe international authority of the United Nations.\nWe have come to the United Nations to state\npublicly that Equatorial Guinea is under threat. We say\nthis out loud, and we hope that we will truly be heard,\nbecause we know that complaints by weaker States\nhave often fallen on deaf ears in this forum when the\ninterests of the strongest are at stake.\nEquatorial Guinea is facing a serious threat, and\nwe ask the United Nations to take serious, committed\nmeasures, not only with regard to the issues affecting\nEquatorial Guinea today but also in order to prevent\n41\n\nother countries in the same situation as ours from being\nvictimized by the same sort of conspiracy in future.\nIndeed, my country is being threatened by the\nincessant and poisonous campaign of defamation\nagainst my Government that has been orchestrated by\npressure groups and by the press of certain countries \u2014\nsaying that we in Equatorial Guinea do not respect\nhuman rights, calling my Government a dictatorship, as\nwell as accusing us of squandering oil revenues. That\ncampaign has as its only objective the justification of\nan absurd intervention by force in Equatorial\nGuinea \u2014 the failed multinational mercenary invasion\nthat was to have taken place on 6 March last.\nThe international community is aware of the\nevents connected to that aborted plan thanks to press\nreports on the trials, held simultaneously in Equatorial\nGuinea and in Zimbabwe, of those mercenaries who\nwere arrested in Malabo and in Harare, respectively.\nIndeed, and under the pretext of supporting the\npolitical claims of a supposed opposition leader in\nexile in Spain, a number of mercenaries, of various\nnationalities but with a common leadership, acquired a\ncargo plane with the goal of transporting to Malabo, in\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, 65 trained, armed\nmen who were to take part in an invasion \u2014 a suicide\noperation. They planned to occupy previously\nidentified strategic areas, in order physically to remove\nthe President of the Republic, members of the\nGovernment and anyone who opposed them.\nThe invasion, planned for the night of 7 March\n2004, would have represented the implementation of an\nelaborate plan, hatched, elaborated and perfected by\nanother group of 18 men, who had obtained a license to\nfly cargo and passenger planes in Equatorial Guinea,\nusing the facilities provided by the Government. That\ngroup was to join up with those coming from Harare.\nThe support that they received from Spain was to\ninvolve the use of two Spanish Navy warships with 500\nsailors on board, for support in case of resistance. The\ngoal was to put in power, at Government headquarters,\nMr. Severo Moto Nsa, who had formed a government\nin exile that was recognized by the previous\nGovernment of Spain.\nFortunately, the solidarity of the Governments of\nAngola, Zimbabwe and South Africa came into play\nand they alerted the security services of my country,\nwhich acted immediately, arresting, on the night of 6\nMarch, the 18 men stationed in Malabo, while the\nHarare Government did the same with those found in\nthat capital\u2019s airport on 7 March 2004.\nThe mercenaries themselves, in public statements\nduring the trials held in Malabo and in Harare,\nexplained the plan\u2019s objectives and named the people\ninvolved. They also gave details on the financing of the\npurchase of arms and of the cargo plane, and on the\noffer of the Spanish ships, which were already, at that\ntime, anchored in the territorial waters of Equatorial\nGuinea.\nThe Secretary-General, as well as the Members of\nthis Organization, should know that, a month before\nthose events, my Government had rejected and\ndenounced the sending of those warships to Equatorial\nGuinea in a note to the Spanish Government, which at\nthe time was using as a pretext its support for the\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea in the conflict\nrelated to its claim of sovereignty over the island of\nMba\u00f1ie. This General Assembly can, I am sure,\nunderstand the danger and the loss of human life that\nthis invasion would have caused if it had succeeded.\nWe know that Equatorial Guinea is a victim for\nthe sole reason that it has respected the principles and\nexercised the fundamental rights of a sovereign State,\nwhich are the exercise of sovereignty by the people,\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other\ncountries and the right to the exclusive use of the\nresources that nature has given it. If this is so, we\nwould like the Assembly to reply to the following\nquestions, if possible.\nWhy are so many negative things currently being\nsaid about Equatorial Guinea in foreign circles, when\nthe country\u2019s people themselves live in peace and there\nare no demands being made by the populace or from\nthe people\u2019s representative bodies?\nWhy this talk of dictatorship and oppression in\nEquatorial Guinea, when the administration in power\nhas re-established political freedom in the country,\nwith 13 political parties in a country of barely one\nmillion people?\nCan a dictatorship based on oppression allow\nfreedom such as the current level of foreign investment\nand the arrival of more than seventeen international\nflights per week to such a small country as Equatorial\nGuinea?\n42\n\nIs there an international police force that has the\nauthority to tell Equatorial Guinea how to use its\neconomic resources, when we already have an\nadministrative and political organization for managing\nour resources with transparency? Can a country that\ndoes not use its resources for the benefit of the people\napprove an annual budget, through parliament, of 618\nbillion CFA francs as a justifiable public cost?\nIs it true that the only way to end the abuse\nallegedly committed by Equatorial Guinea would be to\norganize the kind of terrorist and mercenary invasion\ntargeted at eliminating innocent people that was\nplanned on 6 March 2004?\nEquatorial Guinea would like to know whether\nthis mercenary system is supported by the international\ncommunity. If it is supported, which countries are\nresponsible for this crime? We do not believe that there\nis any difference between the terrorism that we\ncondemn today and the terrorist acts committed by\nmercenaries in various parts of the world.\nEquatorial Guinea is seriously under threat. We\nsay this because we know from reliable sources that\nour enemies will not forgive the embarrassment and\ndefeat caused by the failure of the mercenary invasion\non 6 March. However, this does not mean that\nEquatorial Guinea is going to drop its arms or fall on\nits knees and let the enemy do with it what it will. We\nbelieve that the United Nations responsibility is to\nmaintain peace and international security and to avoid\na merciless war between countries.\nWe would like to affirm that there are countries\nwho are Members of this global Organization,\nrepresented in this hemicycle, whose security agencies\nwere informed of this devilish plan, and who, unlike\nAngola, South Africa and Zimbabwe, who expressed\ntheir solidarity, simply kept silent, waiting for events to\nunfold. But we ask you to leave us in peace, because\nEquatorial Guinea is a peaceful country and we do not\nthink that we have offended anyone.\nA detailed analysis of the situation has shown us\nthat the end of the cold war has not actually led to the\nunification of humanity and the integration of the\nworld as we had hoped. Rather, it has rekindled selfish\nand perverse feelings among those who have always\ndominated \u2014 or have always wanted to dominate \u2014\nthe world. The phenomenon of mercenaries, therefore,\nis a classic practice of States\u2019 piracy, politically dressed\nup and falsely justified by political, economic and\nhumanitarian interests. This is why we continue to see\nthis defamatory campaign, to justify a possible\ninvasion.\nNevertheless, Equatorial Guinea does not need to\nplease the international community with propaganda\nregarding our development. Our only judge and arbiter\nis our own people, to which our State institutions must\njustify their actions. This tactic of creating a falsified\nnegative image of a State is of no surprise to anybody\nat the moment, and it should least of all be a surprise to\nthis world Organization.\nWe also see that the theory of a globalized world\nis a fallacy, because, as we very often say, you cannot\ncall a dog to you while holding a stick to beat it. We\ncannot accept globalization when the concept of\ncolonialism, the superiority of some peoples over\nothers or even of neo-colonialism still exists.\nGlobalization is in contradiction with the concept of\nthe superiority of some over others. Globalization does\nnot mean exclusion as opposed to integration and\ncooperation. Finally, globalization does not mean\npower relations such as those that some would like to\nimpose.\nThe situation in Equatorial Guinea affects other\ncountries of Central Africa as well, as the terrorists\nthemselves have declared. We know that the\nmercenaries have acted in other parts of the world, and\nwe bring this to the General Assembly because of the\ndestructive effects that have been seen in other affected\ncountries. We feel that solidarity among African States\nand the third world in general is absolutely\nindispensable, because we are the direct victims of\nthose who are ordering these mercenary acts.\nIn conclusion, we must stop looking backwards.\nThe current breakdown of the forces of peace,\nindependence and the sovereignty of States, as the\nantithesis to the major wars of the past century, shows\nus that we are close to unleashing a universal\nholocaust. The situation today is that the weakest and\nmost needy are ignored and marginalized. We have to\nput a stop to this race to chaos and build a world that is\nmore respectful of the human race."

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of Bolivia, I wish to express a concern that is\nglobal: the issue of terrorism. A world that is haunted\nby terrorism is an insecure world, one whose prospects\nare threatened. Bolivia believes that the fight against\nterrorism is one of the most important tasks we need to\nundertake together. The incident in Beslan in the\nRussian Federation demonstrates how far it is possible\nto go in brutal actions that are entirely divorced from\nany sense of humanity.\nThe fight against terrorism must also be linked to\nthe struggle against other scourges of concern to us all.\nIn that context, Bolivia affirms its most resolute\ncommitment to the fight against drug trafficking, which\nin our country is being waged through the eradication\nof excess coca, undertaken with respect for the nation\u2019s\ntradition of consumption. That joint task could not be\nfulfilled without the presence and support of the\ninternational community and in the context of shared\nresponsibility. Shared responsibility requires clear\naction to be taken on both sides of the chain of\nproduction to eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking.\nShared responsibility requires the social and the\neconomic issues to be considered when addressing the\nproblem.\nBolivia has elaborated the idea of alternative\ndevelopment, which we would wish to see converted\ninto comprehensive development. In other words, the\nparticipation of the communities and villages where\ncoca is produced in Bolivia should be part of the\ndecision-making process and of the design of strategies\nto modify current practices of cultivation and to\ngenerate reasonable economic options, to open\nmarkets, and to reduce the costs of intervention to the\ninternational community in the eradication of coca, and\nin particular in the process of seeking viable alternative\nways for the Bolivian economy.\nWe believe that the fight against the scourges that\nare currently stalemating humankind could not be\nwaged without a multilateral response to the challenges\nto modern society. We firmly believe in multilateralism\nand strongly support the United Nations as the arena of\nthat multilateralism. We are convinced that the time\nhas come to produce a series of comprehensive reforms\nin the Organization as a whole. That would require,\ninter alia, an expansion of the Security Council at the\nonset of a new historic era. As the challenges have\nchanged, so too must the responses.\nIn that context, we are convinced that another\naspect to be thoroughly reviewed is the paradigm of\nglobal development, which is unsustainable over time\nand will not allow for long-term responses, but which\nwill instead generate complex problems that cannot be\nresolved. A change in the development paradigm\nrequires openness of mind and a heterodox capacity to\nrespond to the basic parameters in which the world\neconomy functions today, without demagogic\nresponses or utopian solutions. On the contrary, we\nneed to ponder such issues as hunger, poverty and\nexclusion, which afflict millions of human beings on\nour planet.\nThis is a good opportunity to recall that, over the\npast year, Bolivia has experienced a particularly\ndifficult situation. In October 2003, a social, political\nand economic crisis pushed our nation to the brink of\nconfrontation and violence, with unforeseeable\nconsequences. The crisis threatened all of our\ninstitutions, and in particular our democratic system.\nThe Bolivian response to that crisis was issued\npeacefully, in respect for democracy, through a\nmechanism of constitutional succession that allowed\nme, as Vice-President, to take office as President and to\nassume the enormous challenges to the country in order\nto restore order, peace and the prospects and hopes of\nour society.\n20\n\nWhy did this crisis occur in Bolivia? It happened\nbecause of an accumulation of historic arrears that, at\nsome point, had to be paid for by our society. Those\narrears included exclusion, discrimination, a vision of\nBolivian society rife with racism, and truly dreadful\npoverty. The efforts undertaken by the country on the\nbasis of a liberal economic model and of a structural\nadjustment model had their highs and lows. Positive\nresults allowed for macroeconomic stability, but\ngenuinely inadequate results in the social sphere were\nthe outcome primarily of exhaustion and the need for\ndifferent responses. All of those historical arrears fell\ndue in October, leading to a popular upheaval that\nended in social turmoil, calling not only for a short-\nterm response \u2014 ours, I believe, was effective in that\ndemocracy and peace were preserved \u2014 but also and\nabove all for a forward-looking solution.\nWhat are the major challenges facing Bolivia\ntoday in its geographical, historical and geopolitical\ncontexts? It must first resolve its own conflict between\nsociety and State and the challenges of its own\neconomic growth. One of the country\u2019s key issues was\nthe definition of an energy policy once we learned that\nour nation has one of the largest reserves of natural gas\nin South America.\nWe chose a path that was difficult, yet attractive,\nand that marked our desire for democratic participation\nand participative democracy \u2014 please forgive the\nwordplay \u2014 within our society. We opted for a binding\nreferendum in which the people of Bolivia were able to\ndecide what they wished to do with their most\nimportant energy resources. The referendum\nhighlighted our will to participate and to define our\nown destiny. It was successfully held on 18 July. It\ntook place in a framework of peace, of democratic\nparticipation and of clear and convincing responses\nthat allowed our Government to move forward with a\nhydrocarbons and natural gas policy that regulates\nexport, industrialization and relations with investors\nand investment companies that are appropriate and\nuseful to our nation.\nIn this forum, I wish to affirm our belief in a\nconstructive and mutually beneficial relationship\nbetween private investors in Bolivia and the\nrepresentatives of the State. Perhaps one of the most\nimportant lessons of recent years is that we must\nneither revert to the old system of State capitalism of\nthe 1950s and 1960s, nor pursue the rigid orthodoxy of\nthe liberal vision.\nThe answer for today is a practical combination\nwithin the false distinction between the market and the\nState. That distinction must be abolished and the\ncombination made viable without exclusions and\nwithout jeopardizing the fundamental concept, in\nwhich we believe, that legal security is guaranteed by\nthe rule of law. That is the path on which we have\nembarked as we work to adopt new hydrocarbons\nlegislation.\nPerhaps the most important thing for Bolivia in\nthe coming months, however, is to reach a new social\ncovenant. While the relationship between society and\nthe State has been severely damaged and threatened by\ncollapse, it is clear that the concept of democratic\nparticipation has to be reflected in that covenant\nthrough a constituent assembly, freely elected to define\nthe outline of the country that we wish to build in the\nimmediate future.\nGiven that my Government has no political party\nor organized presence in that context, we shall convene\na constituent assembly that is truly pluralistic and in\nwhich the elements of our Magna Carta will be\nprovided by various social sectors yet respond to a\nsingle basic concept: an end to exclusion and\ndiscrimination; the option \u2014 in a country where the\nmajority is of indigenous Quechua, Aymara or Guaran\u00ed\norigin \u2014 for the majority to express itself; and the\ndefinition, in a democratic context and in the\nframework of distinct regions and distinct visions, of\nthe profile of a viable nation.\nI also wish to note that we achieved something\nvery important after the crisis: the restoration of peace\nthrough transparent, honest and austere action that\nBolivia urgently needed. This does not mean that the\ntask is done. The struggle against corruption will\nalways be a challenge in our country, as it is elsewhere\nin the world, but I believe that we have demonstrated a\nclear commitment that has given us credibility and\nlegitimacy in our society.\nTransparency, honesty and austerity are vital\nelements in a poor nation that must administer\nappropriately and efficiently the meagre resources at its\ndisposal. In that context, I wish here at the United\nNations to thank the international community, which\nwas consistent and unified in its support for Bolivia\nduring the crisis and in the following months, helping\nus to implement a consistent macroeconomic policy to\nresolve such serious issues as its heavy fiscal deficit.\n21\n\nGiven its geographical location at the centre of\nour continent, Bolivia should be a pivotal country in\nthe fast-paced process of integration. That process has\ntwo major protagonists: the Andean Community, of\nwhich we are a member, and the Southern Common\nMarket, of which we are an associate member. At first,\nwe were a \u201chinge\u201d country, but we are now in the\nprocess of integration that will gradually encompass a\nlarge bloc of South American nations, which we\nwelcome and towards which we are striving.\nIn that context of coordination and integration,\nBolivia holds a key play in any process of\ninfrastructure development. In energy, Bolivia is a\ncountry that can serve as South America\u2019s energy\ndistribution hub. In telecommunications \u2014 fibre optics\nin particular \u2014 and, of course, in highway\ninfrastructure, we are vital and must be an actor that\nfacilitates rather than obstructs.\nI wish to share a thought here with such\nmultilateral entities as the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund and other organizations\nthat are cooperating with Bolivia and other developing\ncountries.\nBecause of its revenues and high level of debt,\nBolivia has been considered to be a heavily indebted\npoor country. In theory, that has given it a series of\nadvantages in debt servicing and, above all, in the\nchannelling of that servicing not towards repayment,\nbut towards social services. Paradoxically, however,\nthis has limited the country\u2019s capacity to obtain non-\nconcessional loans that would allow us to implement\ninfrastructure projects that are of interest not only to\nBolivia, but to all countries of the region.\nWe believe that we must begin to look differently\nat the way international organizations interpret those\nloans in order to make them more flexible and to avoid\nthe paradox whereby an advantage becomes a burden\nthat makes development impossible. We hope that this\nnew approach will be grasped by the international\ncommunity, and in particular by the multilateral\norganizations.\nLastly, I wish to broach a subject that we will\nalways stress in our statements before the world\ncommunity. Bolivia\u2019s landlocked status is a factor that\nhas curbed our development. Bolivia was born as an\nindependent country with a coastline on the Pacific\nOcean. Today, we demand free, useful and sovereign\naccess to that Ocean. Our demand has moral, historical\nand legal bases and is linked to the high economic cost\nthat has made development difficult throughout our\nhistory. We make this demand, and I want to emphasize\nthis, on the basis of a logic of construction \u2014 a logic\nof integration.\nChile and Bolivia are countries that complement\neach other. We are countries that have a destiny of\nshared development and integration. To fail to find a\nsolution to the Bolivian issue is to negate the\npossibility of development and integration and prevent\nit from becoming a reality.\nBolivia is prepared to undertake an open dialogue\nin order to find an appropriate and definitive solution\nto the problem. That is all the more true today because\nSouth American integration is so close at hand, and\nbecause Bolivia\u2019s maritime problem has become an\nobstacle on the path to that integration.\nWe are expressing a rational, constructive\ndesire \u2014 a will for integration. Our demand is\nunchanging and has profound relevance in the context\nof everything I said earlier.\nI should like to conclude by stating here, before\nthe nations of the world, that our country is one of\npeace that believes in disarmament. It believes also\nthat we need to reflect on and change many of the\nparadigms which in the course of time have\ncrystallized certain positions and have limited the\nopen-mindedness that we need today, more than ever,\nin the twenty-first century, in order to face the\nchallenges of the future."

        "file_text": "I am addressing the Assembly today at a most\ndifficult time for our country, when tears are still being\nshed by those who lost their children and loved ones\nduring the horrific terrorist attack in the Russian city of\nBeslan. I would like from this rostrum to take this\nopportunity to express once again my gratitude to all\nthose who have shown their solidarity with Russia in\nthese tragic days. Our special thanks go to the States and\ninternational organizations that extended their helping\nhand to the victims and the bereaved families \u00f3 to all\nthose who have suffered from this outrage.\nI am also addressing the Assembly at a moment\nof truth, when there cannot possibly be any doubt\nwhatever remaining as to the true nature of\ninternational terrorism and the challenge it has flung\ndown before the world community. With their actions\nthroughout the world, the terrorists have once and for\nall placed themselves in opposition to civilized\nmankind. In fact, having made the mass murder of\npeople an end in itself, they have knowingly violated\nall norms of human morality.\nRussia has drawn harsh conclusions. They have\nbeen set forth in the 4 and 13 September addresses by\nthe President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir V.\nPutin. We will not allow anyone to encroach on the\nsovereignty of our State. We will resolutely strengthen\nthe unity of the country and its people in order to\ncounter terror and to guarantee a secure and decent life\nfor our citizens in freedom and democracy.\nThe measures announced by the Russian\nPresident to achieve these objectives will be\nimplemented on the basis of our country\u00eds\nConstitution; and we will continue to defend our\nlegitimate interests throughout the world, not through\nconfrontation, but by means of equitable dialogue,\ncooperation and partnership. Moreover, a readiness to\nengage in honest cooperation in fighting terrorism\nwithout double standards, is becoming one of the key\ncriteria in our relations with any and all States.\nWe must enter into a qualitatively new and critical\nstage in the activities of the anti-terrorist coalition. The\nmeeting of the Security Council of 1 September\ndemonstrated the strong determination of the\ninternational community to continue its fight against\nterrorism in a consistent way. It is important now to\ntranslate this commitment into practical actions as\nquickly as possible.\nIn the three years that have passed since the\nterrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, a\nlot has been done to develop effective partnership in\nthis sphere. However, compared to the scale of the\nthreat, far from enough has been done. It is important\nto learn lessons from the experience gained and to\ndraw conclusions for the future.\nFirst, the global nature of the terrorist threat testifies\nto the fact that security in today\u00eds world is indivisible.\nConsequently, only collective responsibility can make\nthe world secure. The fight against terrorism should\nunite States rather than pit them against each other. We\ncan deal with this evil only on a multilateral basis by\ncombining our efforts and acting in the spirit of solidarity.\nAs President Putin has declared, Russia considers the\nobjective of strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition to\nbe one of our most important tasks.\nA special emphasis here should be placed on\nintensifying the cooperation among our special services,\nwhich, we are convinced, must now be raised to a\nqualitatively new level of trust and coordinated action.\nSecondly, a clear strategy and a generally\nacceptable legal framework are the prerequisites for\nsuccess in combating terrorism. Such a framework is\nenshrined in resolution 1373 (2001) and in other\ndecisions of the Security Council. But now, additional\nefforts are needed. They include making necessary\namendments to national legislation, acceding to\ninternational anti-terrorist conventions and finalizing\nnew international counter-terrorism legal instruments.\nIn circumstances where international terrorism\nhas declared war on our entire civilization, the\ndetermination of States to use their right of self-\ndefence in conformity with Article 51 of the United\nNations Charter is of particular importance. Of course\ninternational law is clearly not an inalterable dogma.\nThe fight against terrorism calls for its development\nand improvement.\nThirdly, the time has come to renounce double\nstandards once and for all when it comes to terror,\nregardless of the slogans in which it may be cloaked.\n31\n\nThose who slaughtered children in Beslan and hijacked\naeroplanes to attack America are creatures of the same\nilk.\nHarbouring terrorists, their henchmen and their\nsponsors undermines unity and mutual trust among\nthose that form part of the anti-terrorist front, serves as\njustification for the actions of terrorists and indeed\nencourages them to commit similar crimes in other\ncountries. I would recall that United Nations decisions\nrequire States granting political asylum to carefully\nexamine the personal records of each individual to\nmake sure that he or she has no links to terrorism.\nAttempts to use the fight against terrorism in various\ngeopolitical games are even more counterproductive\nand dangerous.\nFourth, the utter atrociousness of the recent\nterrorist attacks proves there is the need for reliable\nsafeguards against terrorists gaining access to weapons\nof mass destruction. Russia is prepared for the closest\nkind of international partnership in that area. Our\ncountry was one of the sponsors of Security Council\nresolution 1540 (2004). It is a participant in the\nProliferation Security Initiative and a co-sponsor of the\nGroup of Eight (G-8) Action Plan on Non-\nProliferation. Those initiatives are complementary and\nare designed to increase the effectiveness of the regime of\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nsomething which is especially relevant on the eve of the\n2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nFifth, drug trafficking is increasingly interwoven\nwith terrorism. The drug flow from Afghanistan has\nacquired global significance. The implementation of a\nset of social, economic and law-enforcement measures\nboth within and outside the borders of that country is\nnow more urgent than ever. One of the key elements of\nthat strategy lies in strengthening the existing anti-drug\nsecurity belts and creating new ones.\nRussia is making an important contribution\ntowards resolving the drug problem, including through\nthe formulation of specific legal, political and\noperational measures within the framework of the\nShanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective\nSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO). We are ready to\ncoordinate actions with the Government of\nAfghanistan, and with the multinational and coalition\nforces operating in that country.\nSixth, international terrorists have neither\nnationality nor religion. In fact, it is specifically\nreligion and national culture that, today as never\nbefore, require protection from the devastating impact\nof extremism of any kind. There is a need for\nrespectful dialogue among various religions and\ncivilizations. Russia, which is open both to the West\nand to the East, is ready to play its part in that process,\nwhich is intended to prevent a split in civilization.\nAnother pressing task today is the saving of\nworld spiritual and cultural monuments from attacks by\nextremists. We deem it essential to establish\ncooperation in that area between the United Nations\nand its specialized agencies, primarily the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO). Failing to act here \u00f3 as well\nas standing by in silence at the desecration of\nmemorials to Second World War heroes and victims\nand at attempts to rehabilitate fascists \u00f3 can only play\ninto the hands of those who wish to incite extremist\ntrends in society.\nSeventh, Russia believes that the United Nations\nmust continue to play a pivotal role in uniting the\nefforts of the international community in its fight\nagainst terrorism. As Chair of the Security Council\u00eds\nCounter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), our country\nintends to actively contribute to speeding up the reform\nof that Committee. We propose drafting a new Security\nCouncil resolution that would ensure the most effective\npossible functioning of the CTC, so as to identify, in a\ntimely manner, weak links in the anti-terrorism\nnetwork and increase practical cooperation between the\nCTC and international and regional organizations,\nincluding the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS), the CSTO and the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization.\nThe CIS summit held recently in Astana,\nKazakhstan, reaffirmed the strong potential of CIS\nregional structures in all areas, from anti-terrorist\nactivities and ensuring collective security to\nintensifying economic integration.\nCertainly, in an increasingly interdependent\nworld, the war on terrorism cannot be considered in\nisolation from other pressing issues facing mankind.\nThis is especially relevant to the settlement of\nconflicts, which for decades have been destabilizing\nthe situation at the regional and global levels. Through\nits decisions, the General Assembly must promote a\n32\n\nMiddle East settlement on the basis of commitments\nmade by the parties under the road map. Yesterday, the\nQuartet of international mediators spoke out to that end.\nThe situation in Iraq is a source of serious\nconcern. Russia is ready to render all possible\nassistance towards attaining a political settlement\naimed at preserving Iraq\u00eds territorial integrity and\nensuring its political sovereignty and a genuinely\ndemocratic post-war recovery. The search for national\nreconciliation within Iraq is of key significance; here,\nthe Iraqis could be assisted by the holding of an\ninternational conference with the participation of all\nmajor Iraqi political forces, friendly States, Security\nCouncil members and the League of Arab States and\nother organizations.\nWe must remain vigilant with regard to Kosovo,\nwhich is a dangerous hotbed of tension. There is no\nroom for complacency. We must work to ensure that\nuniversally recognized standards of human rights and\nthe rights of national minorities are applied in the\nregion. We also need to make full use of existing\nmechanisms for conflict settlement within the CIS.\nConsolidating the peacemaking capacity of the\ninternational community is crucial to overcoming\nregional crises. A collective response to humanitarian\ncrises, in particular those on the African continent, in\nfull compliance with the United Nations Charter and in\na spirit of partnership with regional structures, would\nleave no doubt that the Charter remains a universal\nbasis for the effective solution of such problems.\nThe United Nations must continue to focus its\nattention on other global threats to security and\nsustainable development as well. Those include the\neradication of poverty and illiteracy as a breeding\nground for extremism. Annually, our country grants\n1,000 scholarships to students from African countries.\nRussia has contributed $7.5 million to the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and has\nprovided bilateral humanitarian assistance to a number\nof African countries.\nAmong the challenges and threats is that of\nfinding ways to bridge the gap between poor and rich\nStates. Russia has been making its contribution there;\nbetween 1998 and 2002 it wrote off the debt of African\ncountries equivalent to $11.2 billion.\nAnother challenge is ensuring environmental\nsecurity. Here I would like to confirm that in\naccordance with the decision of President Vladimir V.\nPutin we are now engaged in serious consideration of\nratification of the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe challenges also include preventing the\ntransformation of outer space into a theatre of armed\nconfrontation. Together with China, we are calling for the\nconclusion of a comprehensive agreement to that end. We\ncall upon all countries with space capability to join in that\ninitiative. There is also a growing need to elaborate a\nUnited Nations convention on outer space law.\nA further challenge is the fight against gross\nviolations of human rights, with a view to ensuring the\nsecurity and dignity of the individual. The United\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe, the Council of Europe and other\norganizations should not remain passive spectators\nwhen, in some countries, a considerable part of the\npopulation is deprived of citizenship and consequently\nof basic political, social and economic rights.\nOn Russia\u00eds initiative, the General Assembly, at\nits fifty-seventh and fifty-eighth sessions, adopted\nresolutions 57/145 and 58/16 respectively, on\nestablishing, under the aegis of the United Nations, a\ncomprehensive approach to countering new threats and\nchallenges. The resolutions contain specific guidelines\nfor bringing the international community closer to a\nnew security model that would meet the global\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\nThose are the lines along which the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, established\nby the Secretary-General, is organizing its work. We\nhope that its recommendations will pave the way for a\ngenuine enhancement of the effectiveness of the United\nNations. At the same time, reform of the Organization,\nand particularly of the Security Council, should be\nbased on the broadest possible agreement and should\nnot provoke the alienation of States.\nThe international community is undergoing a\ncomplex period in its establishment of a new system of\ninternational relations. It is already clear that this will\nbe a long-term process with an uncertain future and\none that, so far, is difficult to predict. At the same time,\nthere is an enormous increase in the number of new\nunresolved problems and new dangerous challenges to\nsecurity and the development of mankind. We still lack\na collective strategy and universally applicable\nmechanisms for responding to those challenges. In fact,\n33\n\nwe have to constantly improvise and use makeshift\nmeans to ensure world stability.\nA question arises as to whether we could soon\nfind ourselves in a situation in which events start to go\nout of control. Is it not time for the international\ncommunity to assume an active role in impacting upon\nglobal processes and taking targeted actions to\nestablish a more secure and just world order? Russia is\nfully determined, together with other countries, to\nbuild such a world order and take its proper place\ntherein as a free and democratic State.\nMore than half a century ago, the civilized world\nput aside all its disputes and differences and mobilized\nits efforts to counter the deadly threat of Nazi\nenslavement. The enemy that opposes us today is no\nless dangerous and no less merciless. Russia sincerely\nhopes that the forthcoming sixtieth anniversary of the\nend of World War II and the establishment of the\nUnited Nations will become a historic milestone on the\npath to a world order in which the twenty-first century\nsees the noble principles of peace, stability and\ndevelopment enshrined in the United Nations Charter\nhold sway."

        "file_text": "The\nprotracted period of tension that the international\ncommunity is currently experiencing underscores the\nneed for greater cooperation and commitment. It is\nfortunate, therefore, that during the past year the\nGeneral Assembly benefited from the capable guidance\nof President Julian Hunte. The wealth of experience of\nhis successor, Mr. Jean Ping, together with his great\ndiplomatic acumen and insight, lead us to feel\nconfident that he is in the right place at the right time.\nWe pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for the exemplary manner in which he has\npromoted the United Nations and maintained and\nincreased its relevance for the most critical issues of\nthe day. The degree to which the United Nations is\nconsulted on and participates in pivotal events and the\nresolution of crises throughout the world is a tribute to\nMr. Annan\u00eds selfless dedication to the Organization.\nHe is also to be commended for the closer\nworking relationship that he has been able to foster\nwith the private sector and civil society through the\nglobal compact, with the aim of offering help and\nexpertise to needy communities and young people.\nAs the Secretary-General stated in his most recent\nreport on the work of the Organization, the United\nNations \u00f3 indeed, the world \u00f3 has had a very difficult\nand challenging year. Many of us have been\ntraumatized by terrorism, by the brutal acts of\nrepression that are taking place in many parts of the\nworld and by the tense situation and developments in\nIraq.\nFor the majority of the world\u00eds people, however,\nthe most immediate threats are those of hunger,\npoverty, lack of drinking water, environmental\ndegradation and endemic or infectious diseases,\nincluding HIV/AIDS and malaria. Overall, the\nSecretary-General notes that we have departed\nconsiderably from the vision and spirit of the\nMillennium Declaration of 2000, which embodied the\n14\n\naspirations of our time: a world united by common\nvalues, with the primary goal of providing better living\nconditions for humanity, in an environment of peace\nand security.\nUnfortunately, as the Secretary-General notes,\nevents related to terrorism have shaken our sense of\ncommon purpose. The tragedy of 11 September 2001,\nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the ongoing\nbloodshed in the Middle East and other disturbing\nincidents throughout the world have profoundly\ndivided the international community about how to\nensure our collective security.\nWhile we have seen many examples of State\nterrorism, terrorism has become essentially stateless\nand nebulous in nature, and is able to spread without\nregard to borders or nationalities. Although there is no\ndisputing the fact that terrorism must be confronted\npromptly and vigorously, the knee-jerk reaction of\nattempting to crush it militarily fails to address its\nmany manifestations or get to its root causes.\nWe must pay special heed to our prejudices and\nfears as we endeavour to resolve difficult political\nproblems that may have been building for decades.\nWe must also accept that terrorism is not a faith\nor an ideology. It may well be a tactic or a strategy of\nlast resort on the part of those who view themselves,\ntheir faith, their beliefs or their physical environment\nas endangered. While we must act resolutely in\nconfronting acts of terrorism, to do so precipitately,\nwithout examining the underlying causes, could prove\ndestructive or even fatal. No one should excuse the\nbrutal and heinous crimes that are being committed in\nso many places today, but we must acknowledge that\nthe situation requires us to find a solution.\nThe international community is threatened by the\ninstability that this phenomenon entails. We must not\nunderestimate the importance of realistic foreign and\ndevelopment policies directed at resolving tensions and\nreducing poverty. We must find a way to bring the\nworld together to reconcile differences and eliminate\nreasons for misunderstanding. The words and thoughts\nof the late American President, Franklin D. Roosevelt,\nare relevant here. For him, security meant not only\nsafety from attack by outside aggressors, but also\neconomic, social and moral security. As he said,\nessential to such a peace is a decent standard of living\nfor all individuals, for freedom from fear is eternally\nlinked with freedom from want.\nWe are all aware of the commitments we made at\nthe Millennium Summit in 2000. The critical needs and\nills confronting mankind were identified at that\nSummit, and we committed to resolving them in\nvarious ways and according to a specific timetable. The\neight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nrepresent a worldwide quest to eliminate poverty and\nhunger while improving health care, education and the\nenvironment.\nSadly, an evaluation of progress towards reaching\nthese goals by the target dates reveals that we are\nmaking erratic progress. A recent study in Geneva\nfound that the world is scarcely making a third of the\neffort necessary to achieve these modest targets. In\nparticular, the eighth goal, which calls for a global\npartnership of rich and poor countries for development,\nenvisioned a substantial increase in official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), a reduction or\ncancellation of debts, the removal of protectionist\nbarriers for agricultural products and free access to the\nmarkets of the industrialized countries. Needless to\nsay, progress on this goal has been limited. It is the\nonly goal lacking a deadline or timetable and is\nhampered by the apparent reluctance of developed\ncountries to keep their commitments.\nOf the 50 least developed countries (LDCs), 34\nare in Africa. Although five or six African countries\nare close to transitioning, only one has successfully\nmade a smooth transition. Attempts to mobilize\ndomestic resources through the private sector will\nrequire more time and funds. Low levels of savings and\ninvestment rates testify to the huge decline in resources\nneeded for development. Undoubtedly, there is an\nurgent need to continually increase development\nassistance to this group of countries.\nAfrica's need for development assistance has\ncreated the impression that the continent is a major\nfinancial burden to the international community. In\nfact, while Africa is disproportionately aid-dependent,\nit does not receive a disproportionate amount of aid.\nOverall, as things stand, LDCs will not be able to\nreduce poverty, achieve universal primary education or\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. A report by\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) describes LDCs\u00ed woeful\ndeficits in savings dedicated to growth, public\ninvestment and essential services. The report also\nstates that the conclusion is unequivocal and that on\n15\n\nthe basis of domestic resources alone, LDCs cannot lift\nthemselves out of poverty.\nToday, in a post-11-September world, a new\nrationale for aid is emerging. Aid is increasingly seen\nas a potent force in the war on terror by providing\nsupport to both front-line States and weak States in\nwhich terrorism could breed. Additionally, there is a\nmounting recognition of endemic poverty and of the\ninequalities that threaten national security interests.\nDespite this realization, however, development\nassistance programmes have become more selective,\naimed at a small group of countries that are in some\nway qualified. Nevertheless, many countries fail to\nqualify for this aid. Concrete actions must be taken for\nthe sake of the millions suffering in those countries.\nWe ignore them at our own risk.\nCommon sense tells us that conflict is endemic\nand hardly any region in the world has escaped its\nviolence. However, the reality is that no new civil wars\nhave broken out recently, and there has been a decline\nin the number of drawn-out conflicts within and\nbetween States. We notice that although the number of\nvictims has risen sharply, the number of terrorist\nincidents has in fact declined. That said, fewer people\nare being killed by war than at almost anytime in the\npast century. Few wars are beginning and many old\nones are ending. This is particularly true in Africa,\nwhere some seven millions souls perished in the\nconflicts of Angola, Congo, Sudan, Sierra Leone,\nLiberia and Somalia. With the exception of the Darfur\nregion in the Sudan, each one of those conflicts\nappears to be either coming to an end, winding down\nor stabilizing. Of course, we are all deeply saddened by\nthe scale of the tragedy in Darfur. This issue, however,\nneeds to be tackled with the greatest care, clarity,\nfairness and seriousness. We must be cautious about\nmaking generalizations and forming prejudices too\nsoon. We need to direct our efforts towards the right\nsolutions.\nConflicts, of course, require weapons, and\nreducing this threat requires a halt to arms shipments.\nThese shipments divert vital resources from other\ncritical needs. The countries of Asia, Latin America,\nthe Middle East and Africa spend some $22 billion on\narms each year, that is, more than two thirds of arms\nsales worldwide.\nSolidifying peace in the world calls for more\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and additional\npeacekeeping missions. Unless fully supported by the\ninternational community through additional resources,\nfurther operations would strain United Nations\nplanning, pre-positioned forces, logistics, procurement\nand command and control capabilities. What is\nrequired, therefore, is greater assistance for regional\npeacekeeping capabilities, particularly in Africa.\nAny action undertaken must necessarily have the\napproval of the United Nations. This is the only path\nthat confers a degree of legitimacy on any undertaking.\nAction undertaken by the United Nations implies the\napproval of the Security Council. Here it must be noted\nthat the Council continues to operate in accordance\nwith the legacy of the Second World War in terms of its\nstructure.\nFurthermore, the exponential growth in United\nNations membership is not reflected in the Council.\nThere is an urgent need for the developing world to\nhave a stronger voice in the Council. The Council must\nhave a more equitable and realistic distribution, in\nterms of both representation and composition. Security\nCouncil reform is long overdue and there is an urgent\nneed to expand the reform in both the permanent and\nnon-permanent categories, embracing developing and\ndeveloped countries. We are pleased with the\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of the High-\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Some\nof its initial soundings cover the expansion of the\nSecurity Council, recalling members\u00ed commitment to\ncontribute to national and international peace and\nsecurity. We deem auspicious the projected full review\nof the Council\u00eds work at the end of every decade,\nincluding a review of the manpower and financial\nresources of peacekeeping missions. We await the\nPanel\u00eds report this December to the Secretary-General,\nand we will consider his comments during the next\nsession of the Assembly.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nFollowing the Arta Peace Conference, which we\ninitiated and the outlines of which I presented to this\nvery Assembly several years ago, the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nmember States considered it necessary to complete this\nprocess by broadening its base. Since then, and to date,\nthe Somali reconciliation conference in Nairobi,\nKenya, under the auspices of IGAD, has achieved\ntangible progress, which we welcome. Particular\nrecognition should be addressed to all IGAD member\n16\n\nStates for their self-sacrifice and devotion, especially\nto our brothers from Kenya, whose good offices,\npatience and determination allowed the negotiations to\ncontinue even in the most critical moments. Indeed, the\nSomali representatives, spurred by the will of the\nregion and the convergence of political and financial\nsupport of the international community, worked\nrelentlessly to set up the first pillar of the Somali\nGovernment institutions \u00f3 that is, the Transitional\nParliament. This first stage, welcomed by the Somali\npeople within the country and in the diaspora, and the\ninternational community as a whole, finally brought a\nglimmer of hope that the reign of anarchy and chaos\nwould soon come to an end in Somalia.\nThe divergences of view that prevailed for a long\ntime among the countries of the region on ways of\nresolving the Somali conflict have now yielded to\ncommon sense and collective resolve, to work in\nharmony and to collaborate in a sincere and fraternal\nspirit towards the ultimate goal of helping our Somali\nbrothers achieve legitimate and lasting peace.\nThe misunderstandings and difficulties\nencountered during the process have provided an\nopportunity for a fresh review of the statements of the\nvarious regional actors for a clear-eyed and in-depth\nanalysis, imbued with the genuine desire to show the\nsolidarity of IGAD countries towards Somalia, and has\nmade it possible to underscore the common need to\nhelp the Somali people to establish a broad-based\nGovernment that is representative and legitimate. This\nConference has culminated in a Somali Parliament,\nwhere all the factions and various components of\nSomali civil society are represented, such as\nintellectuals, professionals, women and others. Last\nweek, the members of Parliament elected a Speaker,\nand today they are electing his deputies before\nproceeding on 10 October to elect the President of the\nTransitional Government.\nWithout a doubt, and very importantly so, the\nfacts bear out that we are today in a significantly\ndifferent mood than the past, because this time the\nSomali people are more determined to deepen their\ndialogue and the reconciliation process. And as a\nregion we are convinced that we must work together\ntowards achieving the goals agreed upon. It is also the\nresponsibility of the international community to act in\na strong and decisive manner to assist Somalia.\nIn the first place, the international community\nmust provide the necessary financial and political\nsupport to rapidly enable the new Government to create\nthe conditions for achieving the rehabilitation of\nfacilities needed to house the new Government; the\nprovision of direct budgetary support to pay wages and\nother administrative expenditures; and the tackling of\nsecurity issues head-on, in particular, with the\nimplementation of demobilization, disarmament and\nreintegration programmes (DDR).\nIn this first six-month critical phase, the actions\nundertaken by the new Government will determine the\nauthority of its legitimacy as it proceeds to consolidate\nthe gains obtained from the reconciliation process, with\nthe aim of addressing the formidable expectations of\nthe Somali people.\nIn the second place, at the political level, it is\nassumed that the new Transitional Parliament will be\nan all-inclusive body; it will agree to swear in members\nof this National Assembly; and all its members will\naccept the primacy of the rule of law, responsible\nnorms of behaviour, disarmament and demobilization.\nAny contrary attitudes, actions or activities that could\nundermine the efforts to pacify the country or frustrate\nthe effectiveness of the new Government should not be\ntolerated or accepted by the region or by the\ninternational community.\nIn this respect, the Security Council, the unique\nbody entrusted with the maintenance of international\npeace and security, may be called upon to take\nnecessary measures in conformity with the United\nNations Charter to apply the following measures in\ncase the new State faces a resurgence of obstacles to\nthe reconciliation process or restoration of the State.\nThese would be the implementation of a list and a\nsystematic regime of sanctions directed against those\nwho would continue to undermine the Government\u00eds\npeace efforts.\nWe are deeply convinced that this is a unique\nopportunity for the international community to finally\nresolve the long-lasting conflict in Somalia. We need to\nacknowledge the changes that have taken place. The\nSomalis are determined, and the region is united. We\nshould, at all costs, avoid repetition of the scenario we\nhave experienced in the past. Let us seize this\nopportunity. Let us, together, help our Somali brothers\nand sisters in their quest for peace, stability, and unity.\n17\n\nUntil now, innumerable resolutions,\ncommitments, initiatives and peace processes to\nresolve the long-festering Middle East conflict remain\nat best rhetorical. A clear-cut vision of the two-State\nsolution - a secure Israel side by side with a viable\nPalestinian State - rings hollow in the wake of a large\nexpansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied\nPalestinian territories of the West Bank, with the\nbuilding of thousands of houses on land confiscated\nfrom Palestinian families. All this sounds familiar.\nOver the last three-and-a-half decades, we have\nwitnessed the blatant confiscation of Palestinian land,\nfarmlands and water resources. The daily oppression\nand repression of Palestinian victims is beyond\ncomprehension. Nevertheless, the Palestinians continue\nto struggle against all odds to maintain some\nsemblance of civil order.\nMaking an already untenable and explosive\nsituation even worse, Israel, in defiance of\ninternational law and public opinion, has embarked on\nbuilding a separation wall, which is penetrating and\ndividing Palestinian territory in two, well beyond\nIsrael\u00eds 1967 borders, thus creating facts on the ground.\nAnd, as we all know by now, Israel\u00eds proposed tactical\nwithdrawal from Gaza is not a prelude to Palestinian\nstatehood. All these violent and deliberate actions have\nmade a mockery of the road map, and thus, rendered it\nworthless; this is the same fate that met the Oslo\nAccords.\nAbandoned by the international community, the\nPalestinians are struck with indefinite deprivation, a\nsense of hopelessness and statelessness. That being the\ncase, this Assembly has perhaps the sad duty to\npronounce itself incapable of constraining Israel, a\nMember State of this Organization, rather than\ncontinuing to give false hope to a people that has\nalready lost everything.\nDjibouti, strategically situated at a crossroad of\nthe seas, and serving as a gateway to the growing\nAfrican and Middle Eastern markets, has been\nfortunate in achieving a period of sustained growth,\nstability and improved governance. Many of our\nfacilities are presently undergoing considerable\nimprovements to respond to, and to take advantage of\nthe growing demands. A new modern port is under\nconstruction, the first phase being an oil terminal\nexpected to be operational by next year, followed by a\nmajor container terminal, and finally by an industrial\nfree zone that will be the first of its kind in Africa,\noffering light manufacturing and value-added facilities\nand services in a duty-free setting, including\nwarehousing, storage and distribution.\nIn this respect, we wish to express deep gratitude\nto the inspiring and pragmatic leadership of Dubai, our\nkey partner in this visionary venture, that will\nundoubtedly put Djibouti on the map of international\ntrade and shipping.\nDjibouti seeks to improve its private sector\ndevelopment by reducing the cost of creating or doing\nbusiness, by improving its labour force through\ninvestments in education, training, health, social\nprotection and eliminating gender disparities. The\nGovernment is also working to strengthen institutional\ncapacity and governance, while developing its\nabsorptive capacity to better manage, as well as\neffectively utilize, donor support.\nThe Horn of Africa has seen its share of conflict\nand natural disasters. Together with our friends in the\nregion, we are resolutely engaged in mitigating the\nplight of our people, reducing tensions and conflict,\ndeveloping cooperation in the areas of transport,\ncommunications, health and the environment. Regional\nand international security issues and, in particular, the\nfight against terrorism, are of primary concern to the\ncountries in the Horn of Africa. Together with our\ninternational partners, we are doing all we can in the\nfight against that scourge. The same holds true for the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, tuberculosis and malaria. Our\nregion has no other alternative than to strengthen\ncooperation in all areas \u00f3 from economic development\nto improving confidence-building measures.\nDjibouti, friend to all, enemy of none, will spare\nno effort to further intensify the search for greater\nregional harmony and cooperation, while promoting a\npluralistic, open, and healthy society at home."

        "file_text": "It is my honour to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister,\nthe Government and the people of the Commonwealth\nof the Bahamas, on your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I would\nalso like to take this opportunity to congratulate your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, of our sister Caribbean\nState of Saint Lucia, for his outstanding leadership\nduring the fifty-eighth session. His legacy is one of\nwhich we in the Caribbean can be proud, and we wish\nhim well in his future endeavours.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his stalwart defence of multilateralism and\nthe rule of law.\nHurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne\nhave ravaged the Caribbean islands and parts of the\nUnited States. Lives were lost in Haiti, the Dominican\nRepublic, Grenada, Jamaica, Cuba, the United States\nand the Bahamas. The damage to homes and\ninfrastructure and the interruption to normal life and\ncommerce compel us to stress the need for immediate\nand dramatic measures to ensure reconstruction and\nrehabilitation. What has been on offer to the region so\nfar is woefully inadequate.\nOur country\u2019s northern islands \u2014 Grand Bahama\nand Abaco \u2014 received double hits. First, Hurricane\nFrances struck on 13 September, leaving hundreds\nwithout food, water, homes and power. Then came\nJeanne, two weeks later, over the same islands that\nwere hit by Frances, further exacerbating the problems.\nThe Bahamas has many islands and, fortunately for us,\ntourism facilities remain open in the capital, Nassau,\nand facilities on other islands in the chain will be\noperational shortly. That, unfortunately, will not be the\ncase in Grenada.\nRegional heads have called for an international\ndonor conference to meet the needs of all countries\nadversely affected by the hurricanes. The Bahamas\nsupports such a conference. We hope that, as a result of\nthat conference, if not before, there will be a\n6\n\nmoratorium on Grenada\u2019s debt repayment. We also\nrecommend that a regional disaster relief fund be\nestablished to support the reconstruction effort.\nThe word \u201churricane\u201d comes from a word first\nused by the indigenous people of the Caribbean region,\nthe Arawaks. That pre-Columbian civilization must\nhave seen the phenomenon so often that it invented the\nword for it. That means it has been around for some\ntime, and it is likely to be with us for some time to\ncome. It behooves us, therefore, to understand the\nphenomenon that we are facing, including its\nconnection \u2014 if any \u2014 to climate change, which low-\nlying States have been warning about for years. These\nfacts also demand that our own societies should better\nplan for the eventualities that have been, and that we\nknow are going to continue to be, a part of our lives.\nWe cannot let lack of planning be a possible cause of\nthe undermining of our sovereignty in this way.\nThe world is soon wary and weary; the\nphenomenon of donor fatigue sets in. And we lose our\ndignity if we cannot be seen to help ourselves. But if,\nas the scientific evidence suggests, the hurricanes that\nwe now experience are related to climate change, it is\nclear that we cannot defend ourselves alone. A major\nshift on the part of the most active polluting countries\nis required. They must shift gears if the people in small\nisland developing States are going to survive. It is a\nmoral imperative for them to shift gears.\nIn this regard, the Bahamas welcomes the\npreliminary moves by the Government of Britain, as\nwell as the Governments of Japan and of Russia,\ntowards putting climate change closer to the top of the\nagenda. We urge them to continue to use their\ninfluence on their friends to cause a major shift in\nattitude. The implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\nof Small Island Developing States, adopted at the\nGlobal Conference in Barbados in 1994, becomes even\nmore urgent. The follow-up meeting on this issue in\nMauritius in January 2005 now takes on even greater\nsignificance.\nIn this context, I would also like to highlight the\nregion\u2019s efforts to designate the Caribbean Sea as a\nspecial area in the context of sustainable development.\nWe also reiterate our grave concern about the serious\nthreat posed to the security and economic development\nof Caribbean countries by the trans-shipment of\nnuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea. We continue\nto call on States involved in trans-shipment to desist\nfrom that practice.\nThe scenes of death and destruction as a result of\nthe hurricane that affected Haiti in recent days\nreminded us of the political turmoil that that country\nhas endured during the past year. The Bahamas extends\nits deepest condolences to the Haitian nation for the\ntremendous and sad loss of life. The year, which began\nwith so much hope with the celebration of the deeds of\nToussaint L\u2019Ouverture and the two hundredth\nanniversary of independence on 1 January, fell quickly\ninto the abyss of despair on the fateful evenings of\n28 and 29 February. No one will ever know what truly\nhappened on that night as an elected President left his\ncountry with armed rebels nipping at his heels, but it\nfilled the entire Caribbean with sadness. It raised the\nspectre of mistrust of friends. That feeling has still not\ndied, but we must soldier on if we are to help the\npeople of Haiti achieve democracy, economic uplift\nand a just and fair society.\nThe Bahamas stands ready to do what it can to\nassist the people of Haiti in these developments. Haiti\nsits 90 miles from our southern shores, and each year\nthousands of migrants looking for a better way of life\nseek to enter the Bahamas illegally from Haiti. We\nhave practical reasons, therefore, to ensure that justice\nand democracy prevail in Haiti. We echo the call of all\ncountries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\nfor the return to democratic order in Haiti, and we\npledge to help.\nWe regret the failure of the Security Council to\nact in a timely fashion when Haiti\u2019s friends begged for\nthe authority to intervene or to authorize an\nintervention. Perhaps that failure heralds the need for\nthe Council\u2019s reform. The Bahamas supports such\nreform efforts and awaits the report of the High-Level\nPanel appointed by the Secretary-General. But the\nUnited Nations must never stop trying to address the\nissues that face Haiti, because there is a moral\nimperative to eliminate hunger, poverty, disease and\ndiscrimination. In this regard, we welcome the work of\nPresident Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Chirac\nof France, Pope John Paul and other world leaders in\nseeking to ensure that the moral imperatives to which\nwe have referred are placed at the forefront of the\nworld\u2019s agenda. We must never forget what Haiti has\ndone for our region and for the world.\n7\n\nWhile the fight against those who would subvert\nour democratic values by attacks on civilian and\nmilitary targets remains high on our agenda, we must\nnot allow the drums of war to drown out the calls of\nthe world\u2019s poor and disenfranchized. In 2000, we gave\nourselves a set of goals with respect to development\nwith a human face, and we must do all that we can to\nachieve them. The Bahamas has committed itself to the\nfight. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the\nsurvivors of all who have lost their lives in such\nsenseless attacks, particularly in the United States,\nKenya, Spain, Tanzania and Indonesia. But we also\nadmonish all States that terrorism cannot be an excuse\nto limit freedom and to dispense with the very liberties\nthat we are trying to defend and that form the\nfoundations of free and democratic societies.\nAll States ought to act with caution in putting in\nplace rules and regulations for travel, lest the denial of\nthose rights cannot be defended by logic or objectivity.\nThat is especially so where we note that developed\ncountries argue in favour of free trade and\nglobalization but deny the benefits of that trade to\nlegitimate travellers by administrative discrimination\nand bureaucratic procedures and delay. The appeal\ntherefore is to bring some sense of balance, before we\nlose the very thing we seek to save.\nAs part of this overall process of reflection, my\ndelegation welcomes the high-level reviews planned\nfor 2005 of our commitments with respect to social\ndevelopment and the advancement of women. We must\nensure that we undertake an unflinching examination\nof the progress made in achieving the priority goals of\nthe Copenhagen Programme of Action and the Beijing\nPlatform for Action to determine how far we have\ncome and what remains to be done. It is critical that the\noutcomes of the respective appraisals will acknowledge\nthe gaps in implementation and allow States and the\ninternational community as a whole to move forward\nand achieve the timely and effective implementation of\nthe commitments undertaken at Copenhagen, Beijing\nand beyond. We must also make certain that the results\nof our deliberations feed constructively and\nsynergistically into the high-level event in September\n2005, so as to ensure that no ground is left uncovered.\nHIV/AIDS continues to threaten to undermine\ndecades and centuries of progress in health care and in\ndeveloping healthy populations that facilitate economic\ngrowth throughout the world. The Bahamas is a leader\nin the fight against HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region.\nWe urge the continued and unrelenting fight against the\ndisease, to rescue the world\u2019s developing nations from\nthe clutches of that scourge. It must take all of the\npolitical will and financial power of the world\u2019s nations\nto ensure that the scourge is brought under control and\nthen eliminated.\nIn that context, the Bahamas welcomes the recent\ngrant to the Pan-Caribbean Partnership from the Global\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. That\ngrant will provide a much-needed infusion of resources\nfor prevention, care and treatment programmes. The\nBahamas also welcomes the convening of the June\n2005 high-level meeting to review the progress\nachieved in realizing the commitments set out in the\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. The\nBahamas acknowledges the pledge made by the United\nStates to set aside $15 billion to fight HIV/AIDS\nthroughout the world, including in Haiti and Guyana in\nthe Caribbean region.\nIt is an inescapable fact that there can be no\nmeaningful social or economic development without\nsecurity. For many of us in the Caribbean in particular,\nthat security is being undermined by the activities of\nthose trafficking in illicit drugs, illegal weapons and\nundocumented aliens. By virtue of its geographical\nlocation, the Bahamas is an unwitting transit point for\nsuch illegal activities. In the case of illicit drugs, the\nBahamas is neither a producer nor the final destination\nfor them. However, as a trans-shipment point, the\nBahamas, as do other transit countries, experiences the\nillegal activities associated with that trade. Those\nactivities tend to undermine the economic and social\nfabric of our nations.\nWe therefore welcomed the convening in June\n2004 of the first session of the Open-ended Working\nGroup to Negotiate an International Instrument to\nEnable States to Identify and Trace in a Timely Manner\nIllicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, some of the\ntools undermining our safety and security and our\neconomic and social fabric. That meeting was a small,\nbut important, first step in reaching agreement on an\ninstrument on tracing, to enable States affected by that\nillicit trade to more effectively identify lines of supply,\nput measures in place to interdict existing lines and\nprevent new ones, and to cooperate with other States at\nthe bilateral, regional and international levels. At the\nsame time, we continue to call on developed countries\nto take the same extraordinary measures they use in\nseeking to stop drug trafficking into their countries to\n8\n\nstop illegal small arms from reaching our shores from\ntheir countries.\nThe Bahamas joins with other countries of the\nCaribbean Community in voicing our concern about\nthe persistent attempts on the part of some of the\ndeveloped world\u2019s un-elected multilateral bodies to\nexclude developing countries from decision-making\nand norm-setting processes, thereby undermining our\neconomies. Chief among those is the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development. The\ndecisions of those bodies are not friendly acts. We\nrepeat the call we made last year about the need for a\nglobal forum to deal with those unfair practices.\nWe welcome the work that has been done in the\nEconomic and Social Council to redress the imbalance\nin favour of a level playing field. The arrangements for\ndealing with international tax matters in particular are\na source of concern. We pledge to continue to work\nwith the United Nations towards establishing a world\nbody that will deal with those matters in a fair and\nbalanced way.\nYesterday I was in our capital city, Nassau, in the\nBahamas, where we marked 275 years of continuous\nrepresentative, parliamentary democracy. This, then, is\na propitious time to reaffirm the commitment of the\nBahamas to the principles enshrined in the Charter of\nthis great Organization, which will stand as a guiding\nbeacon as we continue to chart a rocky, yet crucial,\ncourse towards peace, security and sustainable\ndevelopment for all the world\u2019s inhabitants. While\nprogress may seem meagre, we must not be swayed\nfrom our course and we must remain confident that the\nbenefits of our activities and efforts will redound to\nfuture generations. I say again that, now more than\never, the world needs the United Nations."

        "file_text": "My first\nwords are to congratulate you, Sir, on your election and\nto tell you how gratified the delegation I have the\nhonour to lead is, seeing you preside over the work of\nour august Assembly. Your great human qualities and\ngreat experience in international relations, to which\nyou have devoted a great part of your life, convince us\nthat our debates will be successful. You can rely on the\nsupport and full cooperation of my delegation in\ncarrying out your noble mission.\nOn this occasion, I would also like to express the\ngratitude of my delegation to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian Hunte, for his dynamic leadership during the\npast session. I would also like to convey to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the expression of\ngreat appreciation as well as the sincere words of\nencouragement of His Excellency, General Lansana\nCont\u00e9, President of the Republic, for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s untiring efforts in defending and promoting\nthe noble ideals of our Organization.\nFifty-nine years ago our Organization emerged\nbased upon universal values that are equally relevant\ntoday. While there has been some definite success in\ndefending those values, the world is now facing the\neffects and consequences of upheavals that threaten the\nfoundations of our institution.\nThree years after the tragic events of\n11 September 2001, international terrorism continues\nto strike out blindly, in an odious manner. The increase\nin terrorism throughout the world is, for my country, a\nsource of great concern. Through me, the Guinean\nGovernment reaffirms its resolute condemnation of\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and\nwishes to express its sympathy and solidarity with the\nvictims of that scourge. My delegation believes that the\nstruggle against terrorism must continue with greater\nresolve, but we must also recognize that we can only\nwin the battle if the international community\nenergetically attacks the underlying causes of that\nscourge, including inequality, poverty and injustice.\nGiven the highly tense international situation\nwith its many hotbeds of tension throughout the world,\nprogress over the last few months in the settlement of\ndisputes is a source of satisfaction to us.\nIn West Africa, after many painful years of\ninstability, we are happy to note positive achievements,\nthanks to the political will and resolve of its leaders,\ncivil society and the international community.\nIn Liberia, there is hope since the transitional\nGovernment was established. The deployment of the\nUnited Nations mission and the progress achieved in\nterms of the disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration programme, are all very encouraging. The\nconsiderable commitments taken in February at the\ninternational conference dedicated to the reconstruction\nof Liberia must be honoured, in order to preserve the\npeace that has been restored, and to ensure security\nthroughout the subregion.\nIn Sierra Leone, the peace-building process\nundertaken with the support of the international\ncommunity has shown some commendable\nsuccesses \u2014 the gradual drawdown in the United\nNations mission troops is being carried out according\nto agreed criteria. Further resources will be necessary\nto strengthen the capacity of the security forces so they\nmay take over from the United Nations Mission in\nSierra Leone, to reduce unemployment among the\nyoung, to reintegrate former combatants and to rebuild\nthe country.\nIn order to promote the momentum of the peace\nprocess, the Summit of Heads of State and Government\nof the Mano River \u2014 enlarged to include the\nneighbouring countries of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Mali \u2014\ntook place on 20 May 2004 in Conakry. The outcome\n19\n\nof the summit shows the political will of our States to\nstrengthen their cooperation for the consolidation of\npeace and promotion of development in the subregion.\nI would like to reiterate the appeal that was addressed\nto the international community to concretely support\nthe activities of the Mano River Union.\nI would also like to renew my country\u2019s appeal\nfor economic, humanitarian and financial assistance so\nthat we can confront the negative impact of continuing\nto manage and care for hundreds of thousands of\nrefugees and internally displaced persons while\nconsolidating our development foundation.\nI can assure you that the Republic of Guinea will\nnot fail in its historical duty to safeguard peace, and\nwill continue to carry out its duties in terms of\nsolidarity to populations in distress in the subregion,\nand we will do this on a basis of mutual confidence and\nrespect for national sovereignty and our common\nobligations.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, notable progress enables us to\nhave hope. We are gratified at the resumption of\ncooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions which\nwill make it easier to mobilize the required resources\nto build a strong peace.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the preservation of unity,\nterritorial integrity and the full sovereignty of the\ncountry must serve as the core of the peace process that\nis under way. We appeal to all parties to rely on\ndialogue in order to overcome the difficulties that lie\nahead on the way to peace.\nGuinea is very preoccupied by the persistence of\ninterdependent transborder problems that characterize\nsocio-economic conflicts and crises. Among those\nproblems are the proliferation of and illicit traffic in\nsmall arms and light weapons, the movements of\nmercenaries, the recruitment and the use of child\nsoldiers and the pillaging of natural resources.\nThe initiative for transforming the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\nmoratorium on export and import of small arms and\nlight weapons into a regional convention is sound and\ndeserves the firm support of the international\ncommunity.\nThe Republic of Guinea encourages the Open-\nEnded Working Group established to negotiate an\ninternational instrument on small arms and light\nweapons to speedily arrive at an agreement ready for\nimmediate implementation.\nLike West Africa, the Great Lakes region is on\nthe road to peace in spite of persistent instability in the\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nIt is hoped that, beyond the instability of the transition\nperiod, the momentum that exists will enable that\ncountry to restore lasting peace and devote its energies\nto national reconstruction.\nMy delegation welcomes the deployment of the\nUnited Nations Operation in Burundi. We urge the\ninternational community to make greater efforts to\nconclude the peace process, thus ensuring genuine\nreconciliation among all citizens of Burundi.\nGuinea is satisfied to note the progress made on\nthe question of the Sudan and urges support for the\nAfrican Union\u2019s efforts for a comprehensive peace\nagreement. Nevertheless, we are concerned at the\nhumanitarian and security situation in Darfur. We\ninvite the brotherly Sudanese Government and the\nparties concerned to spare no effort to reach a\nsettlement to the crisis.\nTurning to the Horn of Africa, my country\nwelcomes the encouraging results of the national\nreconciliation in Somalia. We also hope that Ethiopia\nand Eritrea will manage to settle their dispute and\nrestore peace.\nThe Republic of Guinea is convinced that there is\nno alternative to a political settlement of the question\nof Western Sahara. My country therefore encourages\nthe parties to strengthen their cooperation with the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General in\norder to find a just, lasting and mutually acceptable\nsettlement.\nThe Middle East continues to be the scene of\ngrave events arising from the logic of violence that\ndiminish day by day the chances of a peaceful\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Guinea is\ngreatly concerned at the Israeli Government\u2019s stubborn\ndetermination to continue its construction of the wall\nof separation in spite of the advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice. My country is convinced\nthat peace in the Middle East greatly depends on\nobliging all parties to respect their commitments as set\nout in the Quartet\u2019s road map and the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. I reaffirm the Guinean people\u2019s\nfeelings of solidarity and friendship for the brotherly\n20\n\nPalestinian people and their historic leader, President\nYasser Arafat.\nMy Government remains concerned at the\nsituation prevailing in Iraq. It hopes that the\nestablishment of a secure environment will enable the\nIraqi people to consolidate their sovereignty and\ndedicate themselves to the reconstruction of their\ncountry.\nWith respect to the Korean Peninsula, my\ndelegation urges the parties to continue efforts aimed at\nthe peaceful and independent reunification of the two\nKoreas.\nI also reaffirm the deep commitment of the\nGovernment and the people of Guinea to the one-China\npolicy.\nFour years ago, the adoption of the Millennium\nDeclaration raised hopes for a better life for one billion\nhuman beings. To that end, my country urges the\nUnited Nations and the other development partners to\ncommit themselves fully to contributing to the\nelimination of poverty by implementing the measures\nfor attaining the Goals. Of course, achieving those\nGoals essentially depends on the creation of a global\npartnership for development, in particular in the least\ndeveloped countries and the vulnerable segments of\nsociety.\nWhile it is true that globalization has created\nenormous wealth and prosperity in certain regions of\nthe world, it must also be noted that the majority of the\ninhabitants of the world, in particular in the least\ndeveloped countries, have not reaped the benefits. We\nbelieve that a world that provides no opportunities for\ndevelopment cannot be a world of peace, or even a\nworld at peace.\nThe Monterrey International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and the Johannesburg\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, as well as\nthe recent eleventh session of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development in S\u00e3o Paolo,\nBrazil, and the International AIDS Conference in\nBangkok, Thailand, provided opportunities to make the\nneeded commitments. The plans of action adopted at\nthose conferences should be implemented by all\ndevelopment actors and at all levels.\nWe believe that the 2005 review of\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\nwill enable us to make necessary adjustments and add\nthe needed momentum. In that context, my delegation\nholds that only by increasing official development\nassistance, supported by debt relief and better access to\nmarkets within the framework of a more fair\nglobalization, can we overcome the obstacles to\nsustainable development.\nWith respect to trade, at the present session\nMember States should reaffirm their political will to\nmove beyond the failed World Trade Organization\nConference at Canc\u00fan and conclude negotiations\nconcerning the Doha Development Agenda. The recent\nagreement reached by the General Council of the\nWorld Trade Organization at Geneva is a beneficial\nstep in the right direction.\nConscious of the importance of all that is at stake,\nthe African leaders are more committed than ever to\ntackling the major challenges facing the continent. The\nefforts made to achieve the objectives of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) reflect\nthat awareness. In that context, we appeal again to the\ninternational community for enhanced support for\nNEPAD, which steadfastly places Africa on the road to\nbetter taking charge of its own affairs.\nGiven the many challenges, the Member States of\nour Organization have the critical responsibility of\ntaking action together and individually. Our collective\nresponse, commensurate with all these challenges,\nshould be comprehensive, integrated and multilateral.\nThe reform of the United Nations is now more\nnecessary than ever. I would even say it is\nindispensable. The restructuring of United Nations\nbodies, in particular the revitalization of the General\nAssembly and the reform of the Security Council, will\nundoubtedly enhance the efficiency of our collective\nOrganization.\nMy delegation calls for a reformed United\nNations that is adapted to the new realities of the\nworld, a United Nations of increased solidarity and\ntireless efficiency, better able to strengthen peace and\nstability in the world, for the happiness of our peoples."

        "file_text": "When we met a year\nago, there was widespread concern that we had reached\nan impasse that threatened to paralyse the United\nNations. I am happy to note today that this looming\nthreat of division is receding and is being replaced by a\nrenewed commitment to multilateralism.\nIn that spirit, Denmark welcomes the Security\nCouncil's unanimous adoption of its resolution 1546\n(2004), on Iraq. The resolution is, first and foremost, of\ngreat significance for the prospects of peace and\nstability in Iraq and throughout the region. It is also of\ngreat importance for the Security Council\u00eds ability to\nperform its role as the custodian of international peace\nand security.\nThe United Nations must play a leading role in\nthe political process and in the reconstruction of Iraq.\nThe wisdom and skill of the Secretary-General and his\nSpecial Adviser have advanced this process, and we\nhope that the advisory role of the United Nations will\nbe further enhanced. We urge all Member States to\nsupport the interim Government of Iraq in its\nendeavours to establish peace and security in Iraq.\nThe year 2005 will be the year in which Member\nStates\u00ed willingness to work towards a strong, united\nand effective United Nations will be tested. The\nchallenge is to develop credible, effective and\ncomprehensive United Nations responses to the threats\nand challenges of the new millennium, whether they be\nconflict prevention, conflict resolution and peace-\nbuilding, or the fight against terrorism and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or\nrespect for human rights and international law, last but\ncertainly not least, the enormous challenge of\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\n45\n\nDenmark strongly supports the Secretary-General's\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and\nlooks forward to its report later this year. Efforts to reform\nthe Organization, including enlarging the membership of\nthe Security Council, must continue if the United\nNations is to meet the new challenges. Democracy is\nalso a question of representation, and if large parts of\nthe world do not feel represented in the Security\nCouncil there is a risk that they will not feel bound by\nits decisions. The Security Council must reflect the\nrealities of the world of today, not those of the past.\nWe live in a world in which the distinction\nbetween military and non-military threats is\nincreasingly blurred. Most current threats are complex\nand combine elements of both. Creating synergies\namong development, political and security components\nwill be the key to the success of the United Nations.\nDenmark will endeavour to assist in this process across\nthe full range of United Nations activities.\nDenmark is a candidate for election to the\nSecurity Council during this session of the General\nAssembly. If elected, the focus of Denmark\u00eds tenure in\nthe Council will be to seek new and more effective\nways of integrating security and development and\nstrengthening international law. In that connection, I\nwelcome the Secretary-General\u00eds important opening\nstatement in this debate (see ), in which he\noutlined the fundamental principles for a world order\nbased on international law.\nGreater coherence is needed in international\npeace operations. We firmly believe that the United\nNations needs to give civilian crisis management the\nsame priority that is accorded to military crisis\nmanagement. More than 40 per cent of countries\nemerging from conflict slide back into conflict. In\norder to build sustainable peace, much more attention\nneeds to be given to the civilian aspects of crisis\nmanagement. This includes the demobilization and\nreintegration of combatants as well as the social,\neconomic and legal reconstruction of war-torn societies.\nWe must make State-building a central goal of\nconflict management and peace-building, alongside the\nprovision of basic security. Whatever mechanism we\nset up, the challenge is to ensure the involvement of all\nstakeholders. That includes national Governments, the\nSecretariat, United Nations development funds and\nprogrammes, the Bretton Woods institutions, regional\norganizations and bilateral donors.\nIn order to improve compliance with Security\nCouncil resolutions, the process towards targeted and\nsmarter sanctions should be continued. The challenge\nis twofold. First, the Security Council must rigorously\nimplement its resolutions, including when they\nstipulate serious consequences in case of non-\ncompliance. Secondly, the countries concerned must be\ngiven positive incentives to comply with those\nresolutions.\nTerrorism and the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction are serious threats to peace and\nsecurity and impede progress towards stability and\nprosperity. Terrorists threaten the everyday life and\nvalues of millions of innocent individuals. Terrorists\nmust be stopped by hard power and by soft power to\nprevent decades of unrest and terror.\nCountering new threats requires a multifaceted,\nintegrated response by the United Nations and its\npartners. Success demands synergy, a finely tuned mix\nof diplomacy, aid, police efforts, intelligence, legal\nassistance and - if need be - military power. The\nUnited Nations must take a leading role in the fight\nagainst terrorism, providing both the framework for\nglobal efforts and the legitimacy for collective action.\nTerror must not lead to isolation; it must not stop\nglobalization. In the world of today, huge global\ndisparities in resources have become apparent to\neverybody. Social and economic exclusion, as well as\ndeficient democracies, the absence of the rule of law\nand lack of respect for human rights, contribute to\npolitical radicalization and religious extremism.\nEnsuring that new generations have access to the\nbenefits of globalization - such as democracy and\nhope for a better future - is a global challenge.\nThe main responsibility for fighting terrorism lies\nwith individual States. This includes compliance with\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, as well as\nratification and implementation of the 12 United\nNations conventions against terrorism. Denmark\nsupports efforts to reinvigorate the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee (CTC). We support efforts to renew and\nupgrade the offer of technical assistance to countries\nthat need it. The work of the CTC must be better\nfocused and linked with the assistance extended to\ncountries that have the will - but lack the means \u00f3 to\nmeet the requirements of Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001).\n46\n\nJust as important, we must strengthen\ninternational agreements to prevent the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. Denmark therefore\nsupports Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), and\nlooks forward to its full implementation.\nThe United Nations has been instrumental in\nestablishing the core international human rights\nconventions. This year we are celebrating the twenty-\nfifth anniversary of one of those conventions - the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women. The importance of the\nelimination of discrimination against women and of\nensuring respect for the right of women to decide\nfreely over their own lives - including in matters\nrelating to marriage, reproductive health and\nHIV/AIDS - is self-evident. This main message of the\nCairo Programme of Action, adopted 10 years ago, is\nas relevant today as ever.\nWith a view to eradicating torture, Denmark calls\nupon all States to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol\nto the Convention against Torture, so that it can enter\ninto force at an early date.\nWe are now in the era of implementation of those\nhuman rights commitments that have been undertaken.\nAs the main body in its field, the Commission on\nHuman Rights has a crucial role to play in this respect\nand should be further strengthened.\n2005 will be a defining moment for the United\nNations. World leaders will meet in New York to take\nstock of progress in the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration. That meeting will provide a\nunique opportunity to break new ground, push ahead\nwith the interlinked agenda of peace, security and\ndevelopment and follow up the recommendations of\nthe High-level Panel.\nA key priority for Denmark will be to speed up\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals. The results so far are not sufficiently\nencouraging - especially with regard to Africa.\nDenmark attaches the highest priority to Africa\u00eds\ndevelopment and would like the situation there and its\nprospects to be high on the agenda at the 2005 summit.\nIn order to reach the Millennium Development\nGoals, an effective partnership will be required\nbetween developed and developing countries. The gap\nbetween goals and resources must be closed. We are\ndeeply concerned about the inadequacy of the current\nlevel of development financing. Further resources are\nneeded, as is better coordination in their allocation.\nLast year, Denmark took the lead in making our\ncommitments transparent in a Millennium Development\nGoals report. A new report will be published next\nmonth. We call on all other States to do likewise.\nDevelopment efforts and conflict resolution in\nAfrica must go hand in hand. Progress achieved in\neconomic and social development will be sustainable\nonly if we manage to put an end to conflict on the\nAfrican continent. We stand ready to support the\nsignificant and sustained efforts undertaken by the\nAfricans themselves in this regard. There is a need to\nfurther strengthen the African security architecture in\ncooperation with the African Union, subregional\nAfrican organizations, the United Nations, the\nEuropean Union and Governments acting bilaterally.\nWe also need to strengthen the regional approaches of\nthe United Nations in the field. Denmark stands ready\nto contribute actively.\nFurthermore, recent natural disasters illustrate the\nimportance of dealing with international environmental\nissues such as climate change, biodiversity,\ndeforestation and desertification.\nThe Secretary-General has shown great\nleadership in pressing for strengthened and effective\nmultilateralism, and things are slowly starting to come\ntogether. Our common voyage will not be over with the\n2005 summit - far from it. The High-level Panel's\nreport, a renewed focus on post-conflict intervention, and\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals can herald a new age of strong and effective\nmultilateralism if, collectively, we rise to the challenge.\nThe task of this generation is to hand the world to\nthe next generation in better shape than we received it.\nDenmark will spare no effort in its endeavours to\ntranslate that vision into reality."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it\nis my pleasure to join with preceding speakers in\ncongratulating you on your election to preside over the\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Barbados\npledges its fullest cooperation in the year ahead.\n8\n\nI wish to thank and congratulate your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte, for his\neffective leadership of the fifty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Barbados was particularly pleased\nat the election of a representative of a small island\nCaribbean State to that high office in the United\nNations, and President Hunte\u2019s outstanding\nperformance was testimony to the critical and effective\nrole that small islands can play in the multilateral\nprocess. His guidance of the work to revitalize the\nAssembly was particularly noteworthy.\nThis Organization has been accused of being out\nof touch or, worse, irrelevant to the changing world in\nwhich we live, despite its valiant efforts in recent years\nto promote development, restore peace and maintain\nsecurity in many parts of the world. In these\ncircumstances, it is incumbent upon all Member States\nto reaffirm their commitment to and support for the\nmultilateral process, using the United Nations as its\nprimary vehicle. At the same time, there must be a\nconstant process of review, reform and renewal of the\nOrganization so that it can remain relevant in the\ncontinuously changing international climate.\nFurthermore, it is essential that political will be\nbrought to bear on the seemingly intractable issue of\nreform of the Security Council. Barbados continues to\nbe of the view that the Council must be made more\nrepresentative of today\u2019s membership of the United\nNations, as well as more transparent in its working\nmethods and more democratic in its decision-making.\nThe Security Council must earn the support and\nconfidence of all Members of the United Nations if it is\nto fulfil its important mandate in an increasingly\nvolatile and insecure international environment.\nWe must also recognize that reform cannot be\nkept merely within the confines of the United Nations.\nIt must be accompanied by renewal of the wider\ninternational governance architecture. It strikes\ndeveloping nations as deeply unjust and hypocritical\nthat calls for democratization and good governance in\nthe developing world are not accompanied by calls for\nthose values to be reflected in the multilateral\norganizations by which so many are governed and upon\nwhich so many depend.\nEnhancing the voice and participation of\ndeveloping countries in international dialogue and\ndecision-making is a fundamental prerequisite for\nimproving global economic governance. Debate on\nreform of the international financial architecture should\nnot continue to be restricted to the hallowed halls and\nboardrooms of the Bretton Woods institutions, but\nshould also find a prominent place on the United\nNations agenda. We all have a stake in the global\neconomic system and its management. This highly\ncomplex and increasingly globalized and\ninterconnected world demands a radically reformed\nsystem of global economic and financial governance\nthat promotes equitable development.\nA majority of States Members of this\nOrganization, both developing and developed, have\nexpressed the urgent need for a transparent, open,\ndemocratic and inclusive dialogue between sovereign\nStates on international cooperation in tax matters,\nwithin the universal ambit of the United Nations. The\npersistence of exclusive and restricted membership\norganizations, such as the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD), that dictate\nnorms and standards in international tax cooperation in\nlieu of an inclusive intergovernmental forum, is\nuntenable.\nWhile we are encouraged by the progress in the\ndebate within the Economic and Social Council to\nconvert the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on International\nCooperation in Tax Matters into a committee of that\nbody, with a new and expanded mandate, we still await\na final positive decision on the matter. We consider\nsuch a decision to be an important first step towards\nthe creation of an international forum to promote and\nstrengthen cooperation in tax matters.\nBarbados recognizes the critical need for the\nDoha round of development negotiations to be revived\nwith a developmental focus, and welcomes the decision\non the Doha work programme reached by the World\nTrade Organization on 1 August. The concessions to\nthe least developed countries evident in that framework\nagreement are laudable. But while it would appear that\ndeveloped-country benefits remain substantially\nsecure, the framework severely limits the ability of\nsmall middle-income developing countries to realize\nthe reasonable benefits expected and necessary to\nadvance their development interests.\nTrade is a significant factor in the challenge of\nsustainable development, and trade rules need to take\ninto account the vulnerabilities and the development\nneeds of small States. It is true that developed and\nadvanced developing country partners may experience\n9\n\nsome developmental challenges similar to those of\nsmall States. But it is the inability of the small\neconomies to respond satisfactorily to externally\nimposed shocks which makes them particularly\nvulnerable.\nBarbados appeals to all World Trade Organization\nmembers to support the mandate given at Doha to\nexamine issues related to trade in small economies and\nto frame action-oriented responses to those issues, in\norder to facilitate the fuller integration of small,\nvulnerable economies into the multilateral trading\nsystem.\nWith respect to small island economies, some of\nthe greatest development threats are those from natural\ndisasters of every kind, including floods, volcanic\neruptions, earthquakes and, especially, hurricanes.\nIndeed, in the course of a few hours, Hurricane Ivan\ndevastated the island of Grenada. An economy has\ndisappeared. For many Caribbean countries, this cycle\nof destruction is repeated year after year \u2014 on\noccasion, several times in the same year. Some of us\nare constantly repairing and replacing infrastructure,\nreplanting crops and rebuilding our very lives.\nWhen a hurricane hurts one or more big cities or\nstates in the United States of America, resources are\nimmediately redirected to help those affected. An\nentire state or city has never been eradicated. But that\nis precisely what Grenada experienced just three weeks\nago. Can members begin to imagine the implications of\na small State being reduced to rubble in less than a\nday? Terrorists could hardly do a more effective job.\nYet such factors are never taken into account when\ngross domestic product is computed.\nIn response to this devastation, the heads of\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) met in emergency session and developed\na priority programme for the rehabilitation of Grenada,\nCarriacou and Petit Martinique. For its part, Barbados\nhas already contributed substantially to the relief\neffort. But the reality is that CARICOM by itself does\nnot have the financial resources to cope. We call for an\ninternational donor conference to help Grenada.\nIn highlighting Grenada, however, we should not\noverlook the damage done by Hurricanes Charley,\nFrances, Ivan and Jeanne to the Bahamas, Haiti, the\nDominican Republic, Tobago, Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Cuba,\nBarbados and the United States, all in the course of the\npast few weeks.\nSuch catastrophic events directly affect the ability\nof many small vulnerable developing countries to fully\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals and\nshould be taken into account by the Assembly as it lays\nthe groundwork for the 2005 review. Attaining those\ngoals remains paramount. Barbados reaffirms its\ncommitment to their achievement and urges all States\nto honour the spirit and intent of the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nThe dominant view in some parts of the world is\nthat the most serious threats to international peace and\nsecurity are the recent virulent forms of terrorism, the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and non-\nconventional weapons, and the spread of transnational\ncriminal networks. But for many others around the\nglobe, particularly those in the developing world,\npoverty, the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases,\nnatural disasters, civil strife and other social, economic\nand environmental concerns remain the highest\npriority.\nIt is of the utmost importance that the\ninternational community strive to achieve unity of\npurpose in confronting these diverse security threats\nand challenges, based on a common multidimensional\nsecurity agenda. The Secretary-General recently stated\nthat the global security agenda should reflect a global\nconsensus on the major threats to peace and security,\nbe they old or new, hard or soft, and on our common\nresponse.\nIn that connection, we eagerly await his report on\nthe work of the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change. Member States must stand\nready to make the necessary bold and drastic reforms\nof the current multilateral rules and institutions that\ngovern international peace and security.\nFor small island developing States like Barbados,\nthis wider multidimensional nature of threats to\ninternational peace and security is particularly\nimportant. In addition to the impact of natural disasters\nto which I have already referred, the trans-shipment of\nnuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea, global\nwarming and water pollution all threaten our very\nexistence as a nation. For us, challenges to our\nsustainable development represent some of the more\nserious threats to our security.\n10\n\nIn this regard, we place great emphasis on the 10-\nyear review of the Barbados Programme of Action,\nscheduled to take place in Mauritius next year, since it\nwill present the international community with an\nopportunity to examine past successes and consider the\nfuture challenges that face small island developing\nStates.\nIt is significant that small island developing\nStates themselves have already implemented close to\n70 per cent of the Barbados Programme of Action. We\ntrust that the Mauritius meeting will provide our\ndeveloped country partners with the opportunity to\ndeliver on their past, present and future commitments.\nImplicit in the proposal first submitted to the\nGeneral Assembly in 1999 to designate the Caribbean\nSea as a special area within the context of sustainable\ndevelopment is the recognition of the marine\nenvironment as our most precious natural resource and\none of central social, economic and political\nsignificance to the Caribbean. Its protection and\npreservation remain a major priority of the region.\nThis year, the General Assembly will return to\nthat issue. It remains the ultimate goal of the region to\nhave the Caribbean Sea recognized as a special area\nwithin the context of sustainable development, and we\nlook forward to continued assistance from the\ninternational community in helping us to achieve that\nobjective.\nLet me now turn to issues of particular relevance\nto Barbados and the Caribbean. Barbados considers it\nan irony of tragic proportions that, in the bicentennial\nyear of Haiti\u2019s liberation from colonial control, that\npioneer of independence has been plunged once again\ninto crisis. While the events surrounding the abrupt\ndeparture of President Aristide remain a matter of deep\nconcern \u2014 particularly as they pertain to the\nconstitutionality of the removal of democratically\nelected leaders \u2014 Barbados is committed to assisting\nthe people of Haiti in the process of normalization, the\nsearch for a peaceful solution to the political crisis, the\nstrengthening of democratic governance in the country\nand the provision of humanitarian assistance.\nBarbados is convinced that full engagement with\nthe interim Government of Haiti best serves the\ninterests of the Haitian people and reflects our stated\ndesire to accompany them at this very difficult time in\ntheir history. This is a task which we must not shirk.\nLet there be no doubt: we expect the interim\nadministration to uphold the highest standards set by\nthe Charter of Civil Society for the Caribbean\nCommunity and to fulfil its commitment as regards the\nrule of law, equal justice for all, democracy and good\ngovernance. We look forward to the full\nimplementation of resolution 2058 (XXXIV-0/04) of\nthe Organization of American States on the\nstrengthening of democracy in Haiti, as well as to the\nholding of municipal, national and presidential\nelections in 2005, as promised. In this regard, Barbados\nintends to play its part in international efforts to assist\nHaiti to put the electoral process in place.\nBarbados is hopeful that CARICOM will be able\nto play a key role in assisting Haiti through the\nSecurity Council-mandated United Nations\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). In this\nregard, the CARICOM Special Envoy, supported by a\ntask force, has begun work to coordinate assistance to\nHaiti in areas where the countries of the region have\nrecognized capacity.\nOver the past week, we have all been made aware\nof the perilous situation confronting our brothers and\nsisters in Haiti as a result of the devastation caused by\nTropical Storm Jeanne. Haiti is part of our CARICOM\nfamily. It is our duty to galvanize all our energies to\nassist in mitigating the plight of the Haitian people.\nTwo days ago, the Prime Minister of Barbados,\nthe Honourable Owen Arthur, announced that the\nGovernment will provide technical assistance, as well\nas an initial contribution of 1 million Barbados dollars,\nto the interim Administration for the purpose of\nproviding humanitarian assistance to the people of\nHaiti in the wake of Hurricane Jeanne.\nThe issue of Cuba\u2019s isolation within the\nhemisphere is also of concern to Barbados. We\nembrace Cuba as a bona fide sister State in the\nCaribbean region and are committed to a policy of\nconstructive engagement with its Government and\npeople. We do not believe that efforts to isolate Cuba,\nthrough exclusion from participation in hemispheric\nbodies such as the Organization of American States\nand the emerging free trade area of the Americas and\nmeasures that create greater hardship for the Cuban\npeople such as the 50-year-long economic embargo\nwill foster change in Cuba.\nLike the entire Caribbean Community, Barbados,\nin its engagement with Cuba, has held close to the\nprinciples enshrined in the CARICOM Charter of Civil\n11\n\nSociety. We cannot accept that a regime change\nexogenously imposed upon the people of Cuba could in\nany way be a viable option.\nThe Government of Barbados has long enjoyed a\nwarm relationship with its Caribbean neighbour\nVenezuela and has been deeply concerned by the\npolitical crisis in that country. We are satisfied that the\nrecent referendum has been safely and successfully\ncompleted. We now look forward to a period of calm in\nwhich the process of healing and dialogue \u2014 necessary\nfor better understanding between competing groups \u2014\ncan occur. Venezuela needs all of its people working\ntogether if it is to move forward and continue to be a\nleading engine of development in the hemisphere and\nthe beacon of democracy which its founding father\nintended. It behoves all who cherish democracy to do\nwhat we can to give Venezuelans that opportunity.\nThis year, the world commemorates the struggle\nagainst slavery and its abolition, with the goal of\ndeepening knowledge of slavery and the slave trade\nand highlighting its philosophical, political and legal\nlegacy. As the first landfall upon crossing the Atlantic\nOcean, Barbados was the recipient of a large number of\nAfrican slaves, leading to a major imprint of African\ncultures on the formation of the Barbadian society.\nThat coincidence of history not only created the unique\nfraternal bond that characterizes the relationship\nbetween the Caribbean and Africa but also serves to\nmake us uniquely aware of the interactions that the\nslave trade generated throughout the world among the\ndifferent peoples involved.\nBarbados supports the call of the Director-\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for all peoples\nto eradicate through their actions the vestiges of\nslavery and to combat all new forms of servitude that\nrepresent intolerable violations of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. Indeed, Barbados asserts that\ninternational peace and security can best be achieved\nthrough the building of tolerance based on recognition\nof cultural, racial and religious diversity.\nThe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly\nhas before it a number of issues that have the potential\nto shape the nature and direction of international\nrelations for many years to come. Barbados intends to\nplay an active role in its deliberations."

        "file_text": "I should\nlike at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session and to commend the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte, for his work. I should also\nlike to express once again our appreciation for the\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to\npromote peace and multilateralism.\nWe have come from the South to renew our\nresolve to participate actively in United Nations efforts\nto promote peace, economic development and the\neradication of hunger and poverty. My country is\ngrateful for the endorsement of the Group of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States to occupy a seat on the\nSecurity Council for that regional Group as a non-\npermanent member during the period 2005-2006.\nThere, the Republic of Argentina will reaffirm its\nwillingness to promote consensus aimed at\nstrengthening international law and international peace\nand security. Those are values that we associate with\nrepresentative democracy, respect for human rights, a\nfair global trade system, a better distribution of the\nbenefits of globalization and the democratization of\ndecision-making in international organizations.\nThe United Nations must strengthen itself and\nmove forward in the establishment of valid rules and\nprocedures to guarantee international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe report of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change could play a key role in this\narea. Its proposals should be properly discussed and\nagreed upon in order to implement concrete decisions\nthat reflect and meet the different perspectives and\ninterests of all Member States.\nWe are convinced that there is no acceptable\nalternative to multilateral action. Only through\ncollective debate and consensus could a majority of\ncountries ensure genuine action. The only legitimacy\nfor the use of force must come from the decisions of\nthe Security Council. Because of this, we support\nefforts to provide the Council with greater\ntransparency, and with the participation of the\ninternational community in its decisions, without this\nmeaning increasing the existing privileges or\nestablishing new categories.\n27\n\nThe Council's action should be innovative and\nexpress the political will of the international\ncommunity, all the while recognizing the fact that the\nprimary responsibility in avoiding conflicts will always\nrest with the parties involved.\nWe firmly condemn the acts of international\nterrorism and related crimes that have so deeply\nmarked the memory of the people of Argentina and of\nother nations of the world, making it the maximum\npriority. In this war against terrorism, we require the\nactive participation and cooperation of the entire\ninternational community, based on respect for\ninternational law.\nThere is a necessary link between respect for\nhuman rights and the fight against terrorism. And we\nmust preserve the balance between necessary defence\nand respect for human rights. In order to successfully\ntackle terrorism, we must ensure legitimacy by having\nthe support of international public opinion. According\nto this logic, the fight transcends the purely military\nand predominantly unilateral reaction.\nIn our view, modern threats to peace come from\nboth the criminal action of terrorism and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, from\nmassive human rights violations and the absence of\ndemocratic political participation. But stability and\nsecurity are also affected by hunger and extreme\npoverty, by social exclusion, by ignorance and\nilliteracy, by the spread of disease and epidemics and\nby irreversible damage to the environment.\nAs a result, understanding that peace and\ndevelopment mutually reinforce each other, we must\nwork in a multilateral framework that promotes\nnational and international economic systems based on\nthe principles of justice, equity, democracy,\nparticipation, transparency, responsibility and social\ninclusion. Our commitment to peace and to the\nstrengthening of democracy in the world requires\ndecisive action, which makes it possible to combat\nhunger, illiteracy and disease. These phenomena\nweaken people\u00eds autonomy and dignity and make it\ndifficult for them to exercise their full rights as\ncitizens.\nIn June 2005, the Third Inter-American Meeting\nof Ministers of Health and the Environment, which we\nare preparing, will work on the assessment of our\ncompliance with the Millennium Development Goals in\nthe region and will submit its conclusions to the\nSummit of Heads of State of the Americas, which will\ntake place in Argentina in November 2005.\nWe know that the problems that are linked to\ninequality and poverty cannot be resolved with social\npolicies that are based purely on assistance. Even when\nplans and programmes providing assistance are a\nnecessary resource, we should avoid the growth of\nsocieties that are divided between those who work and\nthose who receive assistance. In this framework, it is\nimportant for work to feature prominently on the\ninternational agenda, linked to freedom, justice,\nsecurity and protection, taking into account the fact\nthat it is the principal means of social integration.\nEconomic growth is a necessary prerequisite, but\nit alone is not enough to remedy the high rates of\nunemployment, lack of job security and work in the\ninformal sector besetting our societies. In the recent\npast, many of our countries we have experienced\nperiods of high growth with low rates of job creation,\nhigh concentrations of income and a significant\nincrease in poverty. It is clear evidence of the\nerroneous nature of the myth that economic growth has\ntrickle-down effects. Accordingly, it is important for us\nto pursue active policies that stimulate business and\nproductive investment and give priority to the\ngeneration of decent jobs, within a new model that\nendows economic change with a strong ethical\ncomponent. Decent jobs are a more effective\ninstrument for ensuring material and human progress\nand should become a goal during the international\ncommunity during the next decade.\nInstitutional conditions that would generate jobs\nare of a varied nature and depend on the specific\ncontext of every country. However, in developing\ncountries, the ability of democratic governments to\nmeet the legitimate demands of job creation from their\nsocieties are impaired by the protectionist measures\nthat limit trade, especially in the agricultural sector.\nThe developed world spends more than $300 billion a\nyear on production subsidies, a figure six times higher\nthan that of the direct aid given to poor countries. The\npoorest countries lose almost $40 billion a year\nthrough loss of exports due to the agricultural\nprotectionism of industrialized countries.\nThe world and the attitude of the developed\ncountries must change if we are to turn things around.\nNo political system or economic plan can be\nsustainable while we have the current critical levels of\n28\n\npoverty and inequality. This is not something that will\nfavour a particular group of countries; it will promote\npeace and security throughout the world.\nIn addition, there is the problem of excessive\nexternal indebtedness, the current design of the\ninternational financial machinery and the role played\nby multilateral funding organizations. The 1990s, with\nits financial excesses at the global level, saw the\nexpansion of already oversized debts for a large\nnumber of countries. For the sake of the development\nof these countries and the international financial\nsystem itself, it is important to emphasize the idea that\neconomic growth is the central and decisive variable\nwhen it comes to capacity to pay and debt\nsustainability.\nDuring the recent international financial crises,\nmultilateral funding agencies made a series of mistakes\nin trying to resolve these problems. The solutions\nproposed spread to other countries, and this greatly\nmagnified the problem of hunger and poverty.\nArgentina\u00eds case is an example. After having\napplied throughout the 1990s the formulas proposed by\nthe multilateral financial agencies, the country\nexperienced a financial crisis that is still not entirely\nresolved. In 2002, the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) made a serious mistake in diagnosing the\nproblem that led to major prognostic errors and poor\npolicy recommendations.\nOn the basis of our more recent experience, and\nbecause of the debt experience, we conclude that we\nhave to provide greater leeway to national authorities.\nWe need a different relationship with the IMF, one\nfavouring a solution consistent with the country\u00eds\ncapacity to pay, sustainable over the medium and long\nterm and supportive of the principles of equality, social\njustice, the fight against poverty, hunger and\nunemployment.\nWe must promote the reformulation of fiscal\naccounting methods in the majority of countries, and in\nparticular in the international financial organizations,\nwith the aim of excluding investment in infrastructure,\nfrom current spending in the calculation of surpluses.\nWe know that fiscal surpluses are necessary in\norder to stabilize economies and respect obligations to\nthe international financial community, but it must be\nunderstood that no surplus is defensible. When\nsurpluses are achieved, thanks to the elimination of\ninvestment in physical and social infrastructure, this\naffects the possibility of political stability and growth,\nwhich turns something that was positive for countries\ninto an imbalance and a negative for the overall\nfunctioning of the economy.\nFrom the tragedy of excessively indebted\ncountries, we conclude that simple formulas which\nclaim to be universal and applicable under any\ncircumstance, at any time and in any place are only\nideological approaches to concrete issues that must be\nresolved with realism, flexibility and proactive\nattitudes.\nWe take responsibility for the adoption of alien\npolicies that led us to the worst of all worlds. But it is\nnot enough for the multilateral lending agencies simply\nto acknowledge their mistake in recommending,\nrequiring and supporting such policies. What we need\nis an urgent and drastic structural reform of the IMF\nthat will enable it to prevent crises and help to resolve\nthem. From a lender of development funds it has\nbecome a creditor demanding concessions. This trend\nhas to change. Otherwise, we will be confined to\nstructural reforms of a theoretical nature the results of\nwhich will guarantee nothing to anyone, and then a\nseries of self-critical reviews.\nMeanwhile, in our countries inequality will\nincrease because of the implementation of those\nreforms. The excluded millions those reforms have\ncreated will weep and poverty will spread. Mea culpas\nwill be uttered, and we will see the growth in the\nnumber of poor people, if we bother to notice them.\nThat is why we say that what is most in need of\nstructural reform are the international lending agencies.\nOn another subject, we firmly support United\nNations peacekeeping operations set up through the\nappropriate organs. This year we have doubled our\nmilitary and police staff in peacekeeping operations;\ncurrently Argentina is involved in eight of the present\n16 operations.\nThe recently created United Nations Stabilization\nMission in Haiti is of particular importance. It is the\nonly mission established by the Security Council today\nthat is located on American soil. The region has made a\ncommitment to help the poorest country in the\nAmericas to return to the path of growth and freedom\nand to guarantee democracy as the best way of\nensuring dignity, social and economic development and\nfull respect for human rights.\n29\n\nIn that regard, Argentina reaffirms its position of\nprinciple based on universal respect for human rights\nand for international humanitarian law. The history of\nArgentina explains my Government\u00eds firm position on\nan issue that is now part of its identity as a democratic\nnation.\nInternational disputes must be settled through\npeaceful means. The United Nations has established,\nthrough different resolutions of the General Assembly\nand the Special Committee on the Situation with regard\nto the Implementation of the Declaration on the\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and\nPeoples, that the question of the Malvinas South\nGeorgia and the South Sandwich islands is a special\ncolonial situation, which must be resolved through\nbilateral negotiations between my country and the\nUnited Kingdom. The decolonization Committee has\nexpressed itself repeatedly on this issue, and we greatly\nappreciate its work to promote the resolution of this\nquestion. We reaffirm once again the constant\nwillingness of my country to reach a just, peaceful and\nlasting solution to this sovereignty dispute, which is an\nissue of great importance for the people of Argentina.\nWe urge the United Kingdom to comply promptly with\nthe international community\u00eds appeal and to resume\nnegotiations.\nIn the southern framework, we are committed to\nprotecting the international community\u00eds interests in\nAntarctica by ensuring that all activities there are\ncompatible with the Antarctic Treaty and with its\nMadrid Protocol on Environmental Protection. The\nestablishment of the Antarctic Treaty secretariat in\nBuenos Aires is already a reality. We are grateful for\nthe assistance of those who always supported\nArgentina as home of the secretariat, which\nundoubtedly will contribute to achieving the main\nobjectives of the Antarctic Treaty system.\nAs a peace-loving State committed to\nmultilateralism, Argentina has always supported the\nsettlement of disputes through negotiation and\ndialogue, in keeping with equity and justice. In that\nrespect, our country fully supports the achievement of\na stable and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on\nthe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and to an independent, viable State,\nwhile at the same time supporting the right of Israel to\nlive in peace with its neighbours within safe and\ninternationally recognized borders. We hope that the\nparties will resume negotiations with a view to\nresolving their differences and will comply with their\nrespective obligations under the road map \u00f3 a plan\nwhich Argentina, along with the rest of the\ninternational community, considers the best way to\nachieve a lasting and just peace in the region.\nThe Argentine Republic supports the attainment\nof the objectives of reducing hunger and poverty and\nthe provision of safe drinking water and sanitation,\nwhich were the main topics of the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, held in Johannesburg\n10 years after the Rio de Janeiro Conference on\nEnvironment and Development.\nThe protection of the atmosphere is of special\nconcern to us, with respect not only to the ozone layer,\nbut to all the action needed to attenuate climate change\nand to help adapt to the changes that are already taking\nplace \u00f3 which are at the root of the severe weather\nconditions that affect developing countries in\nparticular. In view of our concern, and convinced of the\nneed for the prompt entry into force of the Kyoto\nProtocol, we have invited to Buenos Aires the tenth\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in order to\nhelp to give greater impetus to our joint effort to adapt.\nI hope to be able to welcome and host Government\ndelegations at the high-level segment that I will have\nthe honour of opening in Buenos Aires.\nFor that reason, we are calling upon the\nAssembly to show the necessary strength, courage and\nresolve to create a world of justice and equity and to\nput an end to the unfair rules often imposed by\nmultilateral financial institutions, which cause very\ndifficult problems for many countries and which\nincrease poverty."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you,\nSir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. May I assure you of\nIndia\u2019s full support in ensuring its success.\nAs we gather here in the sixtieth year since the\nUnited Nations was founded, we might perhaps pause\nto reflect on the fate of the ideas and ideals of the\ninternational community that inspired its creation. The\npost-war generation had already become aware that the\nworld which had emerged from the ashes of a global\nwar could no longer be a peaceful world unless the\nunderlying forces of conflict were addressed\neffectively by the entire community of nations as a\ncollectivity. Nations were therefore united to make the\nworld a safer and more peaceful place \u2014 a world in\nwhich free peoples could pursue together a destiny of\nshared prosperity.\nThe impulse behind the creation of global\ninstitutions nearly 60 years ago has become an even\nmore pressing reality today. If we look around us, the\nsingle most defining characteristic of our contemporary\nworld is the global, transnational character of the\nchallenges we confront, whether these are in the realm\nof international security or in that of development.\nVirtually every major issue that we face as nation-\nStates has both a domestic and a transnational\ndimension. It is becoming increasingly apparent as\nnever before that, unless we fashion a global response\nto those challenges based on a meaningful consensus,\nwe will not succeed in creating a world that truly\nmanifests the ideals of the United Nations.\nTerrorism is one such challenge for which many\nof us have paid an unacceptable price. We shall not\nforget that, three years ago, it was this great city that\nwitnessed the single most horrendous terrorist act in\nhuman history. Approximately three weeks ago, in\nRussia, the world saw another brutal act of terror\nwhich took the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians,\nincluding a large number of young children.\nTerrorism exploits the technologies spawned by\nglobalization, recruits its foot soldiers on ideologies of\nbigotry and hatred, and directly targets democracies.\nAnd yet, it is a sad reality that international networks\nof terror appear to cooperate more effectively among\nthemselves than the democratic nations that they target.\nWe speak about cooperation, but we often seem\nhesitant to commit ourselves to a truly global offensive\nto root out terrorism with the pooling of resources, the\nexchanging of information, the sharing of intelligence\nand the unambiguous unity of purpose that is required.\nThat must change. We do have a global coalition\nagainst terrorism; we must now give it substance and\ncredibility, avoiding selective approaches and political\nexpediency.\nI now turn to other challenges that we face today,\nsuch as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThere is an increasing reliance on restrictive regimes\nand on the use of punitive action to confront this threat\nto international peace and security. Although India is\nfirmly opposed to proliferation and has an impeccable\nrecord in that respect, we believe that it is only a global\nconsensus of willing nations that will ultimately prove\nto be truly effective in that regard.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention is a good\nmodel to follow with respect to other weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. It is through\nrepresentative institutions, rather than through\nexclusive clubs of privileged countries, that we can\naddress global threats posed by the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\ndelivery. As far back as 1988, Prime Minister Rajiv\nGandhi outlined a series of specific steps in an action\nplan, whose central proposition remains valid even\ntoday \u2014 that progressive steps towards the elimination\n14\n\nof weapons of mass destruction must be based on a\nbalance of obligations between those who possess such\nweapons and those who do not.\nIt is quite evident today that a global discourse is\nrequired for evolving a more cooperative and\nconsensual international security order. India believes\nthat such consensus must differentiate between States\nwhose actions strengthen non-proliferation and those\nthat weaken the realization of its objectives.\nLet me now turn to the central theme for the vast\nmajority of United Nations Members; the challenge of\ndevelopment and the eradication of mass poverty.\nGlobalization has undoubtedly brought enhanced\neffectiveness and efficiency in the functioning of our\neconomies. It has integrated marketplaces, higher\nstandards of living and a revolution in global\nconnectivity.\nBut there is also the phenomenon of widening\neconomic disparities, both within and among countries.\nConnectivity also means that the people are painfully\naware \u2014 in real time \u2014 of how far and how fast they\nare falling behind in their relative living conditions.\nDevelopment today is no longer a function of domestic\nresources and national policies alone. It is a process\nthat is vitally linked to the international economic\nenvironment that the developing countries face.\nThe international community must find ways to\ncontract those circles of exclusion. We need to find\ninnovative sources of financing and access to new\ntechnologies that are necessary to assist those who are\non the margins of globalization. Just as prosperity\ncannot be sustained by being walled in, poverty cannot\nbe banished to some invisible periphery. Development\nmust therefore return to the centre of the global\ndiscourse. We must evolve equitable and rule-based\nregimes to manage global trade, investment flows and\nthe movement of services.\nFour years ago, at our Millennium Summit, we\nadopted ambitious global development goals, but it is a\nmatter of concern that we have already fallen behind in\ntheir implementation.\nWhile globalization has generated new\nchallenges, it has also given us new technologies to\ndeal with those massive challenges. The world faces\nominous pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, but it today\nalso possesses remedies and skills that can rid the\nworld of that scourge. We face problems of\nenvironmental degradation in many parts of our planet,\nbut we also have available safe and environment-\nfriendly technologies.\nMany countries are beset by problems of hunger\nand malnutrition, but we possess modern techniques of\nfood production and processing to make a hunger-free\nworld a credible and realistic dream. Although our\nexcessive dependence on hydrocarbons raises concerns\nabout the long-term availability of energy and about\nthe security of supplies, technology has made available\nmany environmentally sound alternative technologies.\nWhat we lack, however, is a truly global agreement and\na mobilization of the international community to\novercome the massive challenges.\nThe experience of the decades since the inception\nof the United Nations demonstrates the great\nsignificance of democracy as an instrument for\nachieving both peace and prosperity. While it is\ngratifying that the frontiers of democracy have\nexpanded dramatically in the last decade and a half,\nthey still exclude significant numbers.\nOnly a few months ago, in India\u2019s fourteenth\ngeneral election, our country went through the largest\nexercise of popular will in the world. I can therefore\nassert with confidence, the importance that national\narticulations in global forums have in truly reflecting\nthe democratically expressed will of their people. We\nchoose to overlook the absence of democracy in too\nmany cases for reasons of political expediency.\nDemocracy\u2019s representative nature validates the\ncommitments we take on as countries; it should also\ndetermine the manner in which the architecture of\ninternational institutions evolves. What is required for\nthe international community to successfully deal with\nglobal challenges \u2014 whether they be security\nchallenges, economic challenges or challenges in the\nsphere of the environment \u2014 is the existence of\ninternational institutions and a culture of genuine\nmultilateralism.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\nare the only instruments available for responding\neffectively to the challenges we face collectively. But\nwhat is missing is our sustained commitment to\ndemocratizing the functioning of the United Nations.\nIt is common knowledge that the United Nations\nis often unable to exert an effective influence on global\neconomic and political issues of critical importance.\n15\n\nThat is due to what may be called its democracy\ndeficit, which stands in the way of an effective\nmultilateralism based on a democratically-evolved\nglobal consensus.\nTherefore, reform and restructuring of the United\nNations system can alone provide a crucial link in an\nexpanding chain of efforts to refashion international\nstructures, imbuing them with a greater degree of\nparticipatory decision-making so as to make them more\nrepresentative of contemporary realities.\nOur Millennium Declaration recognized the\nurgency of the reform of the United Nations Security\nCouncil. An overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s\npopulation cannot be excluded from an institution that\ntoday legislates on an increasing number of issues,\nwith an ever-widening impact. The expansion of the\nSecurity Council, in the categories of both permanent\nand non-permanent members, and the inclusion of\ncountries like India as permanent Members would be a\nfirst step in the process of making the United Nations a\ntruly representative body.\nI would like to make brief references to two\ncountries with which India has had historically friendly\nties and whose early return to political normalcy is the\nfocus of the world\u2019s attention.\nThe situation in Iraq causes us great concern. The\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in erasing the\ndiscord of the recent past and in ensuring that the Iraqi\npeople can soon exercise effective sovereignty,\npreserving the country\u2019s unity and territorial integrity.\nAn end to the suffering of the Iraqi people and\nrecognition of their aspirations should be the guiding\nobjectives. Consistent with our longstanding ties of\nfriendship with the Iraqi people, India will contribute\nto Iraq\u2019s humanitarian and economic reconstruction.\nIn the past three years, the international\ncommunity has assisted Afghanistan in pulling back\nfrom the brink of chaos and chronic instability. We\nsincerely hope that the upcoming presidential elections\nand the subsequent parliamentary elections will allow\nthe Afghan people to express their will, free from\ninterference and intimidation. India\u2019s assistance to\nAfghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development will\ncontinue.\nRelations between India and Pakistan have been a\nmatter of attention for the international community. It\nis known that in January this year India and Pakistan\ninitiated a composite dialogue to resolve all issues,\nincluding that of Jammu and Kashmir. I reaffirm our\ndetermination to carry forward that dialogue to a\npurposeful and mutually acceptable conclusion.\nIn closing, I would like to reaffirm India\u2019s\ncommitment to the principles that have brought us\ntogether in this Organization. Those principles retain\ntheir relevance and validity even while the global\neconomy and the international political order pose new\nand very different challenges. All of us have to grow\nout of the comfort of the predictable, discard\nconstraining habits of thought, and move forward with\nconfidence to meet the demands of the present and the\nfuture. Each of us has to be prepared to take on new\nobligations and larger responsibilities relevant to the\nneeds of our time.\nI deem it a privilege to say unhesitatingly that\nIndia is conscious of the responsibilities that lie ahead.\nI speak of an India on the move \u2014 on the cutting edge\nof economic, technological and developmental\ntransformations. This is an India endowed with\noutstanding human resources, and we are putting in\nplace policies which will respond to emerging and\ncritical tasks. We have the capabilities and capacity to\ntake these on, and to participate in the restructuring of\na just and dynamic world order. We are confident that,\nin the inextricably interdependent world we live in, our\ncommitment to the common good, which this\nOrganization embodies, will be resolute and full.\nIn this, we are inspired by the vision of\ninternationalism bequeathed to us by India\u2019s first Prime\nMinister, the great Jawaharlal Nehru \u2014 a vision of a\nworld order whose pillars are peace, harmony,\ncooperation and development. That vision needs to\nreanimate the collective wisdom of the world\ncommunity for a new partnership to meet the\nunprecedented challenges we face."

        "file_text": "A few weeks ago, 200\ninnocent children were killed by terrorists in Beslan.\nToday alone, 1,700 children will be born marked by\ndeath from HIV/AIDS from their first breath. Also\ntoday, hundreds of children will die from starvation,\nbullets or mines in numerous parts of the world.\nHas this world become a better place than it was\na generation ago? Yes, I still believe it has. Democracy\nis more widespread than ever before. The cold war has\ncome to an end. Fewer people are suffering from\nfamine.\nBetter - but still, this world is not a good place.\nAs long as children die of famine, as long as war and\nviolence end lives that have barely started, the world is\nnot good. As long as children die from curable diseases\nsuch as malaria and tuberculosis, we - the political\nleaders of our countries - have not done enough.\nWe need a stronger commitment, a stronger link\nbetween words and deeds. We must pull together, more\ndetermined than ever. Each individual carries a\nresponsibility to take action for the sake of the\ncollective. We need a stronger United Nations.\nI want to see progress. Sweden is a staunch\nsupporter of United Nations reform efforts. While\nadvocating reforms, we believe that the core principles\nof the United Nations Charter remain as valid as ever.\nThreats to international peace and security must be met\ncollectively. The use of force is permitted only as a last\nresort and when authorized by the Security Council,\nunless it is an act of self-defence.\nWe need to make the United Nations more\nrelevant. We need a United Nations that can act early\nand quickly, in an integrated, sustainable and\nlegitimate manner. Last year, the Secretary-General\ncalled upon us all to take decisive action in order to\nsafeguard multilateralism. He will need our strong\nsupport to follow up on the report of the High-Level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\nFor the Security Council to remain legitimate,\nrepresentative and relevant, its composition must better\nreflect the world of today. Since the adoption of the\nUnited Nations Charter, a small number of countries\nhave emerged as key political and economic Powers.\nThose countries should be given a role which is\ncommensurate with their importance. We also need a\nSecurity Council that ensures the legitimate interests of\nsmall and medium-sized countries. An expansion of the\nSecurity Council should not undermine its efficiency.\nA way to safeguard this would be to limit the use of the\nveto power. I hope that the High-Level Panel will\npresent a bold proposal that will end the present\nstalemate. A joint seat for the European Union should\nnot be ruled out as an option for the future.\nManaging transition from conflict to peace has\nbecome a primary responsibility of the United Nations.\nA standing committee of the Security Council to advise\nit on post-conflict transition issues would facilitate that\ntask. The Economic and Social Council must be more\neffective in bridging the gap between peacekeeping,\npeace-building and development.\nStill, weapons of mass destruction constitute one\nof the main threats to international peace and security.\nThe threat of terrorism in connection with the\nproliferation of such weapons is real.\nThe need for strong policies in disarmament and\nnon-proliferation is acute. The nuclear-weapon States\nmust show real progress towards disarmament. Efforts\nto combat proliferation must be strengthened.\nCompliance with existing treaties leaves much to be\ndesired, and must improve.\nA wave of terrorist acts has shaken the world in\nthe past few years. The months when we have not had\nto mourn victims of terrorism are easily counted. We\nare all repelled by the barbaric acts of terrorism around\nthe world, from Beslan to Jakarta. Nothing can be\ncrueller than the violent, senseless and tragic loss of\ninnocent lives. All States must work together to\npreserve a democratic, secure and open society. That is\nhow we will defeat terrorism.\nBut we must also admit that we will never be\nsuccessful if we fail to defeat the causes of terrorism.\nFor me, it is clear: fanaticism and fundamentalism\n42\n\nexploit people's sense of injustice and lack of hope.\nPoverty, oppression, insecurity, intolerance, absence of\ndemocratic structures and lack of political freedom \u00f3\nthey are all part of the breeding ground.\nThe fight against terrorism must be carried out\nwith determination. There are no short cuts: human\nrights must be respected; international law must be\nfollowed. Our global human rights instruments aim at\nprotecting the individual. But just as human beings are\nequal, so are States, big and small. International law is\nthe ultimate guarantee that all States, no matter their\nsize or power, are treated equally. For the sake of all\nnations, we need a strong multilateral system.\nThe conflict between Israelis and Palestinians\ncontinues to take innocent lives, causing unending\nhuman tragedy. Commitment from the parties to a\npeaceful solution and an end to occupation is crucial.\nOn the Israeli side, excessive violence, extrajudicial\nkillings, settlement activity and destruction of property\nmust end. Israel's right and obligation to protect its\npeople must be exercised within the context of\ninternational law. On the Palestinian side, areas of\nparticular concern remain corruption, and security and\npolitical reform. The indiscriminate and horrendous\nterrorist attacks must stop, and the Palestinian\nAuthority must do more to achieve that.\nTo realize the vision of two States - a viable and\ndemocratic Palestine living in peace and security side\nby side with an Israel within secure and recognized\nborders, on the basis of Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) - the parties need to meet\ntheir obligations. The road map of the Quartet is the\ntool to achieve this, but both sides must demonstrate a\nwill to use it.\nIn Iraq, a united international community should\ngive the Iraqi people all necessary support for the\nbuilding of an independent and democratic Iraq. To\nthat end, the role of the United Nations is vital. What\nIraq and the whole region need is not a new war, but a\nnew peace.\nIn Afghanistan, the security situation remains\nworrying. The attacks against national and\ninternational assistance workers are unacceptable. The\ninternational community should stand by Afghanistan\nin building a stable, secure and democratic society.\nThe size and scope of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations have expanded dramatically. I\nwelcome the trend towards peacekeeping operations\nwith broad and comprehensive tasks, including the\nprotection of vulnerable civilian populations.\nChildren continue to be victims of war and\nconflict. Nothing can be more important than the life\nand health of children. The late Swedish Prime\nMinister Olof Palme used to say that it is not\nmeaningful to talk about 'my children and your\nchildren'; it is all about our children - the only\ntangible connection to the future that we have. Their\nprotection should be paramount to all of us.\nFour years ago, Security Council resolution\n1325 (2000) on women, peace and security was\nadopted. It was a groundbreaking achievement. But\nnow we need to do more to translate its common\nobjectives into concrete improvements for women\naround the world.\nAn increasing number of United Nations and\nother peacekeeping missions are set up in Africa.\nWhile hardship is the plight of countless men, women\nand children on the continent, Africa today brings hope\nof a more vigorous leadership to confront its\nchallenges. President Thabo Mbeki showed the way\nwith his bold New Partnership for Africa\u00eds\nDevelopment (NEPAD) initiative. From that followed\nthe creation of the African Union, which is now\nestablishing itself as a decisive body for addressing\nviolent conflicts.\nInternational law should guide us in all our\ncollective efforts to attain freedom from weapons of\nmass destruction and terrorism, sustainable\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. Our finest\nachievement in international law in recent years is the\ncreation of the International Criminal Court. I call on\nthe Security Council to consider the possibility of\nreferring matters to the Court. Sovereignty entails\nresponsibility. The prevention of atrocities requires\ninternational action if Governments fail to assume their\nresponsibility.\nAt the Stockholm International Forum on the\nprevention of genocide last January, we pledged to\nshoulder our responsibility to protect potential victims\nof genocide, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. We\npledged to ensure that the perpetrators of genocidal\nacts are brought to justice. And we pledged to\ncooperate in the United Nations on these efforts.\nDiscussions on the definition of genocide should never\nstop us from taking action when it is called for.\n43\n\nThe recent Security Council resolution, resolution\n1564 (2004), on the terrible tragedy in Darfur is a\nnecessary step in this direction. I particularly welcome\nthe request to establish an international commission of\ninquiry. My Government stands ready to give the\nSecretary-General our full support in that task.\nI also welcome the appointment by the Secretary-\nGeneral of Professor Juan Mendez as his Special\nAdviser on the Prevention of Genocide. That will serve\nto make clear the link between massive and systematic\nviolations of human rights and threats to international\npeace and security.\nAnother issue of serious concern is the use of the\ndeath penalty. For me, as a democrat and humanist, it\ncan never be accepted. I want us to make every effort\nto seek the abolishment of the death penalty.\nThe Millennium Declaration and the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals are at the core of the world\u00eds\nefforts to put an end to hunger and poverty. The\ncollective political will to give priority to sustainable\nglobal development, over short-term national interests,\nwill be the decisive factor in turning promise into\nreality.\nRich countries must fulfil their commitments. I\nam proud to tell you that Sweden will reach its national\ngoal of 1 per cent of gross national income for official\ndevelopment assistance in 2006. But development\nassistance alone will not yield the needed results. Both\nthe developed and the developing world must move\nforward on a number of other issues. And Sweden will\ndo its part.\nWe have translated the international agenda into\nnational policy, giving the entire range of government\nactivities one single objective: to contribute to\nequitable and sustainable global development. We will\nact in a coherent way with that single objective in\nevery field, whether trade, environment or agricultural\npolicy. But this is not enough. Other decisive areas are\ngood governance and transparency, democracy and\nhuman rights, women and workers\u00ed rights. Let us end\nthe blame game. Let us focus on getting the job done.\nNext year, we will gather in this Hall for a\nsummit meeting to review progress on the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. By\nthen, we will also have reflected on the findings of the\nHigh-Level Panel and the recommendations of the\nSecretary-General.\nIt will be a decisive moment for the United\nNations. It will be a chance for us, the Members of the\nUnited Nations, to show that we believe in collective\naction and that we will shoulder our responsibility for\nmaking our international institutions stronger and more\neffective.\nLet us not fail the United Nations at this most\ncritical juncture. Let us not shirk our responsibilities in\nthe face of complex new realities. Let us choose a\nsecure and prosperous future for all."

        "file_text": "First, I\nwish to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession.\nThe most recent Arab Human Development\nReport of the United Nations Development Programme\nidentified the pressing challenges facing the Arab\nworld both now and in the future. Thus, it contributed\nto triggering a broad debate on the future of reform in\nthe Middle East.\nPartly in response, the Tunis Arab Summit\nadopted in May 2004 a document on the process of\ndevelopment, modernization and reform in the Arab\nworld with a view to improving joint Arab action. That\nplatform paper highlighted the need to consolidate\ndemocratic principles and to broaden the base of\npolitical participation. It also called for intensifying\nefforts to improve performance in the political,\neconomic, social and educational areas by: giving more\nattention to youth issues, the advancement of women\nand the modernization of social institutions throughout\nthe Arab world; improving education; completing the\nArab common market plan; and laying out a pan-Arab\neconomic development strategy. Jordan, for its part,\nsupports this vision, which is in line with the plans we\nhave already been pursuing within our national reform\nagenda.\nJordan believes that for reform to be truly\nmeaningful it has to emanate first and foremost from\nwithin society and be sensitive to the particular\ncharacteristics and needs of each country. Accordingly,\nwe in Jordan sought to develop an integrated agenda\nthat addresses the primary issues of concern to our\ncitizens throughout the country. Those include broader\npolitical development and personal freedoms, greater\nroles for women and youth, a more efficient judiciary\nsystem, educational reform and the achievement of\nsteady economic growth with a view to improving the\nliving conditions of all individuals, leading to a more\nprogressive, open and tolerant society.\nWithin the same framework, the Government of\nJordan sought to strengthen the partnership between\nthe public and private sectors, both inside Jordan and at\nthe larger, Arab regional level. The most recent inter-\nArab initiative was launched by Arab private sector\n12\n\nand grass-roots civil organizations, with active\nJordanian participation, in Amman on the margin of the\nWorld Economic Forum, which was convened at the\nDead Sea last May. That initiative laid the foundation\nfor the delineation of a vision for the Middle East for\nthe year 2010. A well-developed plan of action will be\nlaid out at the Davos World Economic Forum in 2005.\nThe plan will provide a framework for pooling and\nanalysing constructive inputs and proposing answers\nfor the challenges facing Jordan and the region in\ngeneral.\nHowever, the series of reform measures currently\nunder way in Jordan will be inadequate without the\nsupport of the international community. The help we\nneed involves support for our development projects,\ndirect assistance to the Jordanian economy and foreign\ndebt relief. Of special significance in this regard is the\naid needed and expected from the Group of Eight\nindustrial Powers to Jordan\u2019s plans and initiatives,\nwhich have been based on positive, realistic and\nsustainable goals.\nThe long-standing status quo in our region has\nmade virtually impossible all serious efforts to forge\nahead with the overall Middle East reform exercise.\nThe creation of a favourable climate that helps\naccelerate regional development and progress depends\non the termination of the Israeli occupation of Arab\nland on the basis of international legality with a view\nto ensuring security and stability in the region.\nThe time has indeed come to focus on starting the\npeace process on the basis of the road map and the\nterms of reference it contains, including the Arab peace\ninitiative and implementation by both the Israeli and\nPalestinian sides of their respective obligations under\nthe road map. In fact, the road map provides a well-\ndefined vision of the ultimate solution of the\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, namely the vision put\nforward by President George Bush of the United States\nof two States living side by side in peace. President\nBush reaffirmed that position in a letter he sent last\nMay to His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein.\nThe letter also elaborated the firm position of the\nUnited States, which rejects any measures that would\nprejudice the outcome of final status negotiations on\nthe basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973).\nThe launching of any serious political process\nrequires immediate action on the part of all parties to\nput an end to violence and to all forms of killing of\ncivilians. Let me recall here that, according to the road\nmap, the obligations of both sides must be carried out\nin concert. For its part, Israel should fulfil its\ncommitments, beginning with the cessation of all\nsettlement building and all extrajudicial killings. At the\nsame time, the Palestinian side should complete the\nreforms required to control the security situation in the\noccupied Palestinian territories and bring violence to\nan end. In that regard, we welcome the decision to\nconsolidate the Palestinian security apparatus. Israel\u2019s\nannouncement of its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza,\nhowever, must be effected as an integral part of the\nroad map and within its terms of reference. The\nwithdrawal must be coordinated with all parties\nconcerned, especially the Palestinian side, in order to\nensure a smooth transfer of power.\nIt has become abundantly clear, now perhaps\nmore than ever before, that there is a real need to\ndevelop an effective monitoring mechanism, operated\nby the Quartet, to ascertain whether all parties meet\ntheir mutual obligations and to ensure the scrupulous\nimplementation of the road map by the two sides in\ntheir progress towards a successful conclusion. Here, I\nwish to pay tribute to the Quartet for its persistent\nefforts to maintain the momentum of the peace process.\nOnce again, I wish to reaffirm Jordan\u2019s\ncommitment, along with that of all other Arab States,\nto the Arab peace initiative which the Arab Summit\nadopted in Beirut in 2002 with a view to putting an end\nto the Arab-Israeli conflict through the conclusion of a\ncollective peace agreement providing for the security\nof all countries in the region and laying the foundation\nfor the establishment of relations with Israel. The\nagreement would also create a framework for a\nsolution to the Palestinian refugee problem on the basis\nof General Assembly resolution 194 (III), a full Israeli\nwithdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in 1967\nand the establishment of an independent, sovereign and\nviable Palestinian State.\nJordan stresses the need to respect and implement\nthe advisory opinion of the International Court of\nJustice (ICJ) on the separation wall being built by\nIsrael in the occupied Palestinian territories. The\npronouncement of the International Court of Justice is\nthe law, and no peaceful settlement of the Palestinian\nquestion can be realized unless it is based on\nobservance of the rules of international law and the\nrecognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\n13\n\npeople, including the right to self-determination. In\nthat regard, the Court\u2019s opinion was both clear and\nspecific on the following points.\nFirst, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is\nan occupied territory and, under international law,\nIsrael is an occupying Power. Accordingly, the claim\nthat the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is a\n\u201cdisputed territory\u201d has been dismissed once and for\nall.\nSecond, the relevant rules of international\nhumanitarian law are applicable to the occupied\nPalestinian territories, including The Hague\nRegulations of 1907 and the Fourth Geneva\nConvention of 1949, which, according to the\nInternational Court of Justice, are legally applicable to\nthat territory.\nThird, the Palestinian people have the right to\nself-determination and Israel is violating that right in\ncontravention of the binding norms of international\nlaw.\nFourth, the Israeli settlements built in the\nterritories occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem,\nare in breach of the rules of international humanitarian\nlaw.\nFifth, the construction by Israel of the wall in the\noccupied Palestinian territories, including East\nJerusalem, is illegal. Furthermore, Israel must cease its\nviolations relating to the construction of the wall by,\ninter alia, dismantling those portions of it erected in the\noccupied Palestinian territories, reinstating the rights of\nthe owners whose lands were lost and compensating\nthose who incurred losses as a result of Israel\u2019s illegal\nactions.\nSixth, the construction of the wall and its route\ncreate a fait accompli on the ground which could\nbecome permanent and which, in that case, would be\ntantamount to the actual annexation of the occupied\nPalestinian territories.\nSeventh, the international community is under a\nlegal obligation to refrain from abetting Israel in its\nillegal activities and is prohibited from recognizing the\nillegal situation effected by the construction of the\nseparation wall.\nAccordingly, Jordan welcomes General Assembly\nresolution ES-10/15 and considers it an important step,\nreflecting the international community\u2019s recognition of\nthe legal conclusions of the International Court of\nJustice and its desire to take practical steps to enforce\nit.\nThe separation wall threatens the national\nsecurity of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The wall\nis not only a barrier to the establishment of a viable\nindependent Palestinian State, but it also partitions the\nWest Bank into three distinct, isolated sections.\nMoreover, and in view of the arbitrary Israeli closures\nand restrictions on movement, the occupied Palestinian\nterritories are witnessing an unprecedented level of\ndeterioration in every aspect of their political, social,\neconomic, security and humanitarian situation. This is\nbound to have a spill-over effect on neighbouring\ncountries, especially Jordan.\nThat is the backdrop against which Jordan\nsupported the efforts leading to the adoption of the\nInternational Court of Justice advisory opinion and\nAssembly resolution ES-10/15. Jordan will continue to\nsupport the Palestinian people in its efforts to establish\nan independent State on its national territory, on the\nbasis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), the principle of\nland for peace, the road map and the Arab peace\ninitiative. We also stand ready to provide any\nassistance that the Palestinian side might seek to help it\nto reform its administrative and security structures with\na view to fulfilling its obligations under the road map.\nJordan welcomes the formation of the interim\nIraqi Government and the restoration of Iraqi\nsovereignty at the end of last June. In that regard, we\nwish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations and his Special Adviser, Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi, for their unrelenting efforts, which\nculminated in the formation of the interim Government\ndespite the enormous odds they encountered at every\nstage of the process.\nJordan underscores its support for the\nGovernment of Iraq and stands ready to lend all\npossible assistance to Iraq, its people and Government\nin the forthcoming phase in order to enable the country\nto rebuild its institutions, manage its own affairs and\nrecover its regional and international status. The\nongoing transition in Iraq and the need for it to develop\nits political and economic processes require the\ncooperation of all parties. With support, the Iraqi\npeople will be able to determine their political future\nwithout external intervention, gain control of their\n14\n\nnatural resources and preserve Iraq\u2019s territorial\nintegrity.\nDespite overwhelming odds and the current\ninstability, it is our hope that elections for the\ntransitional national assembly and the formation of a\ntransitional Government will be completed by the end\nof January 2005. Jordan calls upon all States to provide\nevery possible assistance towards the achievement of\nthose goals. The United Nations obviously has a\npivotal role to play in ensuring a successful outcome.\nIn that regard, we welcome the appointment by the\nSecretary-General of his Special Representative for\nIraq, Mr. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, and express our\nwillingness to fully cooperate with him in order to\nensure the complete and smooth fulfilment of the\nUnited Nations mandate in Iraq as set forth in Security\nCouncil resolution 1546 (2004).\nIn the meantime, Jordan strongly condemns\nviolence, the killing of civilians and beheadings in\nIraq. We remain committed to helping our Iraqi\nbrothers in the training of Iraqi police and army units\nin order to enable them to improve their capacity to\nrestore control over the security situation, as well as\nthrough the provision of necessary humanitarian\nassistance. It is indeed regrettable that there is still a\ntiny minority representing extremist movements and\norganizations that seek political power by means of\nintimidation and violence under the false pretext of\nIslamic action. Such groups exploit Islam as a means\nof achieving political or even personal gain by\nresorting to violence and terrorism and thus,\nunfortunately, tarnishing the image of Islam, a faith of\nmoderation and tolerance.\nWe also condemn all acts of terror, including\nthose gruesome and blind acts perpetrated in Madrid\nand Beslan, which require our firm collective stand in\ncombating them.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 marked a new\nera of immense challenge to the international\ncommunity in terms of dealing with the repercussions\nand implications of such events. Fighting international\nterrorism entails taking measures that affect\ninternational relations and the principles that have\nguided States since the creation of the United Nations\nand the adoption of its Charter.\nIn our view, a meaningful and effective global\ncampaign against terrorism requires consensus on the\nfollowing principles: Respect for the provisions of the\nCharter and the rules of international law, and non-\ntransgression against the sovereignty of States; striking\na balance between the counter-terrorism measures\ntaken by States and the principles of human rights,\npublic freedoms and non-abuse of the state of\nemergency to justify counter-terrorism measures;\nproviding a clear and specific legal definition of\n\u201cterrorism\u201d as well as of the concept of \u201cterrorist\ngroups\u201d that would not allow any legal justification for\nthe commission of terrorist acts. By the same token,\nsuch definitions should not compromise the rights\nenvisioned in the Charter and in the provisions of\ninternational humanitarian law, such as the right to\nself-determination.\nIn the same vein, combating global terrorism\nought not be a tool for discrimination against the\nfollowers of any creed or a cover for assault against\ntheir religious beliefs. Finally, the \u201cno justification for\nterror\u201d policy should not lead to disregard for its\nunderlying causes. Rather, an effective battle against\nterrorism would require global cooperation in\naddressing its root causes and the genesis of the\nphenomenon.\nI am pleased to announce that the Government of\nJordan has welcomed the formation of the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change to examine\nthe modalities for improving the performance of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security and its reform in general. We\nsupport the exercise undertaken by the Panel and look\nforward to receiving its recommendations at the end of\nthe year.\nWe share the vision, laid out by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his reports to the General Assembly, that\nreform is a continuous, comprehensive and dynamic\nprocess that must include all political, economic,\nadministrative and financial activities of the United\nNations. We also believe that, if reform is to succeed,\ngenuine partnership between Member States\nrepresented by the regional groups and the Secretariat\nof the United Nations is required. In this regard, we\nbelieve that the thrust of reform should be an\nupgrading of efficiency and not a reduction in the\nexpenditures or in the budget of the Organization.\nTherefore, a set of benchmarks must be developed to\nassess performance. In the meantime, there should be\nno room for the random setting of agenda priorities or\nfor selectivity in implementing reform.\n15\n\nRegarding reform of the Security Council, I\nwould be remiss if I failed to commend the Open-\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\nSecurity Council. Jordan supports the principle of\nincreasing membership in both permanent and rotating\nseats in order to make the Council more representative\nof the United Nations membership.\nIn this regard, Jordan is of the view that the\nresponsibilities of Council members should be\nreconsidered in order to ensure that all members have\nthe capacity and political will to contribute effectively\nto peacekeeping operations by way of meeting their\nobligations under the Charter. The contribution by\nSecurity Council members of human resources to\npeacekeeping field operations, not just of financial and\nequipment inputs, is an essential requirement for the\nsuccess of those operations. This is indeed a primary\nresponsibility that must be met by members of the\nSecurity Council, especially the permanent ones. In\naddition, we think that effective operations require the\ndevelopment of a flexible mechanism that allows the\nadoption of clear resolutions by the Council, in close\ncoordination with troop-contributing countries that are\nnot members of the Council, as well as functioning in a\ntransparent framework.\nIn closing, let me once again thank you, Sir. I\nwould also like to wish this session of the General\nAssembly every success as I pray to almighty God to\nguide us to better serve our people and to live up to the\nresponsibilities entrusted to us."

        "file_text": "More than ever, Africa is making headlines in the\ninternational community. Unfortunately, it is more\nabout crises, wars and problems of failing States that\nare attracting the world\u00eds attention. Yet, some positive\naspects do exist.\nAfrican countries are resolutely taking their\ndestiny into their own hands. Good governance is no\nlonger an empty word. Democracies are developing\nand taking root. The fight against corruption is\nseriously under way. In many States on the continent,\nthere is a strong willingness for peace, security and\nstability, as well as better conditions for development.\nAfrican countries are deciding to unite in order to\nstrengthen their abilities. The African Union, the New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development (NEPAD), the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the\nSouthern African Economic Community, as well as\nother organizations, are becoming more and more\nefficient in resolving conflicts on the African\ncontinent. They are gradually gaining the respect of\ntheir partners from Europe, America and Asia.\nFor its part, Madagascar has successfully\nundertaken major reforms in order to ensure stable\ndemocracy and good governance, to establish a trustful\npolicy, to protect freedom of the press, to decentralize\nand evolve the administration\u00eds functions and\nresponsibilities and, lastly, to encourage international\ninvestment.\nMadagascar is seeking to play an active and\nefficient role in African and international\norganizations. We strongly support the strengthening of\nthe United Nations. We endorse the enlargement of the\nmembership of the Security Council in order to have a\nbetter balance between developed and developing\ncountries. It is high time for Africa to obtain a\npermanent seat, and this is also the case for Germany,\nBrazil, India and Japan, which are major contributors\nto the United Nations.\nMadagascar supports any effort to promote peace,\ndemocracy and the rule of law in Africa. We are\ndevoted to good governance, respect for human rights\nand the fight against terrorism in Madagascar and\nelsewhere in Africa. Recent examples attest to our firm\npolitical will, including Madagascar\u00eds strong support\nfor the declaration for free elections, signed in Port\nLouis; its participation in the Moroni Agreement to re-\nestablish peace in the Comoros; and its signing of the\nagreement on human rights in Geneva.\nMadagascar has made great progress, which has\nbeen recognized by international institutions and the\nmajor Powers. Economic and political development has\nbecome a reality in our country. However, we are also\nthreatened by natural disasters, such as cyclones, as\n10\n\nwell as by the rise in oil prices, by the debt burden and\nby the lack of access to the markets of industrialized\ncountries. We are concerned by the slow\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action\nadopted by the international community in 2001. We\nneed more foreign investment on our continent, both in\nthe public and private sector.\nI urge the Assembly to assume more\nresponsibility for a just and fair world and urge\nMembers to assume more responsibility for Africa.\nAfrica is ready to take its destiny into its own hands.\nWe are aware of our own responsibilities; however, we\nmust share them. The globalization of the economy\nmust go hand in hand with the globalization of\nresponsibilities.\nWe know of success stories relating to this kind\nof responsibility. Nevertheless, we have experienced\nsome cases, mainly in Africa, where the world has\nfailed in its responsibilities with resulting tragic\nrepercussions. Let us look at the African continent. Do\nnot forget the catastrophes of the past nor overlook the\ncatastrophes of the present. But, above all, consider the\npotential of our future. How will Africa look in 10 or\n20 years? Can we imagine this?\nAfrica can become a flourishing continent; it has\nenormous potential, which may be the source of\nprosperity for both Africans and the world. First of all,\nit has human potential. More than half of the African\npeople are under the age of 25. Today\u00eds young Africans\nare more open and more dynamic. They can narrow the\ngap between the past and the challenges of today. They\ndeserve a better education and professional training\nthat is suited to the needs of the market. Education-for-\nall programmes are vital. Investing in education is\nmore profitable than any other investment in poverty\nreduction. African\u00eds destiny will depend on the\neducation of our young people.\nWomen in Madagascar are sometimes more\npersistent than men. They deserve more than their\ntraditional role within the family. Let us give them the\nchance to fulfil themselves, to enjoy the same rights as\nmen. All of us will benefit from their wisdom and\ndedication.\nI would now like to speak about agricultural\npotential. In Madagascar, more than half of the arable\nland is still unexploited. We can double or triple the\nproductivity rate. Let us help farmers to organize\nthemselves, to use better seeds and modern irrigation\nsystems and to obtain easier access to fertilizers. Let us\nset up infrastructures to develop markets. Let us\nsimplify land registration. Let us institute appropriate\nfinancial systems to encourage farmers to become\nentrepreneurs. Let us set up infrastructure and systems\nfor the processing of natural products. Let us build\nfood processing units and undertake related activities.\nLet us extend the food chain. Let us develop food\nprocessing networks in rural areas. The green\nrevolution that the Secretary-General spoke about\nrecently is not a dream.\nNext, I wish to speak about economic potential.\nDevelopment at the base, sustained by international\ninvestment, will generate high economic growth.\nMadagascar experienced economic growth of 9.6 per\ncent in 2003, and we hope to achieve the same\nperformance in 2004 and 2005. This is also possible\nfor other African countries. With such a high economic\ngrowth rate and more than 900 million consumers, the\nAfrican market will become increasingly worthwhile.\nAs to energy, we are all aware of the fact that the\nworld energy situation is critical and affects not just\nour economies but our ecology as well. What potential\nexists in Africa? Half of the African countries, like\nMadagascar, could produce an abundant supply of\nhydraulic energy; only 7 per cent of this potential is\nexploited; only 1 per cent of the world\u00eds solar energy\ncomes from Africa. Let us conclude an agreement on\nenergy development in Africa. The potential lies in\nreforestation and in the Kyoto process.\nThen, there is ecological potential. In addition to\nthe energy and the climate, we can share the values of\nour nature with the world. Seventy per cent of\nMadagascar\u00eds plants and fauna are endemic. At\npresent, we cannot truly assess the extent to which they\nwill be of benefit for medicine, as well as in other\nfields.\nWith all this potential, the development of Africa\nis in the interest of the great Powers. Their leaders\nshould know what African development can offer to\nworld prosperity, peace and security. Africa is a\ncontinent of the future. Africa can become a\nflourishing continent. Let us seek a common vision and\nfind new approaches to develop Africa.\nAfrica is ready for a new future. We Africans are\nready to resolve armed conflicts. We are ready to win\nthe war against poverty and other diseases. We are\nready for enhanced democracy and good governance.\n11\n\nWe are ready to work and cooperate closely for peace,\nstability and security. We are ready for an open market\nsystem. We are ready to strengthen our abilities. We are\nready for competition. We are ready for new\nleadership. We are ready for a new Africa.\nThat is why we ask for international rules that are\nacceptable to and accepted by all countries, be they\nlarge or small. We are asking for mutual respect. We\nare asking for closer cooperation.\nWe are asking for a comprehensive plan for the\ndevelopment of Africa. We are asking for a \u00ecMarshall\nPlan\u00ee for Africa: a plan that should be based on the\nNEPAD objectives; a plan that includes the Evian\nSummit objectives and measures, adopted by the\nGroup of Eight, but that goes even further; a plan that\nis more than just an emergency measure; an\nappropriate plan that promotes all the assets - the\nentire potential - of Africa. Let us act at once and\nwithout delay to implement it.\nLet us promote the potential of Africa. The\nimpact for African people and for the international\ncommunity will be enormous."

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me\nto congratulate you on your election to the office of the\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. I wish you every success and all the best in\nyour very important work. I would also like to thank\nyour predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for his leadership\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.\nThe current session is very significant for\nEstonia, since it is the first time ever that we\nparticipate at the General Assembly as a member State\nof the European Union and the NATO. We are\ntherefore more aware than ever before of our shared\nresponsibility for the world, but also of our\nvulnerability to global threats.\nDuring the last few years, we have all witnessed\nnew threats to world peace and security. We have also\nseen how these threats are all connected to economic,\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian problems. The fifty-\neighth session of the General Assembly focused on the\nsituation in Iraq. However, securing peace and stability\nin the Middle East remains an ongoing concern. I hope\nthat all of this has only deepened our conviction that\nthe goals and principles of the United Nations Charter\nhave not really lost their topicality but rather, are even\nmore topical now. In today\u2019s world of new threats and\nchanging global security, we need shared solutions\nmore than ever before. The United Nations is the only\norganization established to coordinate, on a global\nscale, the efforts of States in safeguarding international\nstability and security. The United Nations has to be\neven more decisive and efficient in order to\nsuccessfully fulfil its important responsibilities in this\nnew situation.\nThe reduction of world poverty continues to be a\ncentral issue on the global development agenda; less\npoverty would certainly mean more international\nstability and security. The international community has\nmade a commitment to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015, halving poverty\nin the world by that time. That is a very optimistic\npromise indeed, and it assumes that all countries must\nperform even more purposefully and in an even more\ncoordinated manner. High-level meetings in Doha,\nMonterrey and Johannesburg have shown us the way;\nnow, we must act.\nAt the forthcoming 2005 summit, we will review\nour progress in fulfilling the goals set out in the\nMillennium Declaration. I would like to appeal to all of\n25\n\nus here to work so that we would be content with the\nconclusions in the interim report.\nTogether with other United Nations Member\nStates, Estonia shares responsibility for balanced\ndevelopment in the world and makes its contribution\ntowards achieving the common goals. Only recently,\nwe were one of the recipient countries of international\naid. Now that we are one of the donors, we are very\nmuch aware of how important it is that international\naid be coordinated and harmonized. We began\nproviding international aid in 1998. Time has shown\nthat the Estonian experience in building up democratic\ninstitutions, implementing economic reforms and\ninvolving civil society in public life and decision-\nmaking can really help other countries where such\nprocesses are still in their initial stage.\nDespite the work that has already been done to\nachieve the very challenging Millennium Development\nGoals, we must admit, unfortunately, that the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor is widening. What is\nmore, it is taking new forms in our changing world. In\naddition to economic inequality, the information era\nhas brought about the so-called digital divide, a divide\nbetween information-rich and information-poor States\nand nations as well as social groups. I would like to\nbriefly elaborate on this topic.\nIn spite of the rapid development in information\ntechnology over the last ten years, only a small group\nof privileged countries and social groups have\nbenefited from the so-called digital revolution. For\nexample, let us consider access to the Internet. Many of\nus cannot really imagine life without the Internet, but\nfour-fifths of the world population have never had any\ncontact with the Internet. More than a half of Internet\nusers live in Europe or in North America, which\ntogether represent only 17 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation. In Africa, only 1.4 per cent of the\npopulation uses the Internet.\nThe digital divide exists not only between\ncountries but also within countries, between different\nsocial groups. The causes of such a divide can be age,\ngender, language, education or income. The digital\ndivide is a reflection of technological, social and\neconomic backwardness, perhaps due to a lack of\ninfrastructure or to that infrastructure being very\nexpensive. At the same time, the digital divide is not\nonly an expression of existing socio-economic\ninequality, but also amplifies it and even causes it.\nToday, the social and economic value of access to\ninformation is much higher than it was 20 years ago.\nUnequal access to know-how, information networks\nand opportunities to contribute to these networks, will,\nin the longer term, lead to a further marginalization of\npoor countries and poor social groups. Paradoxically,\nthe very same Internet is behind this marginalization,\nalthough it is supposed to be the cheapest and most\nefficient way to exchange information and knowledge\nin the world.\nSince information technology has a strong impact\non economic growth and competitiveness, there is no\ndoubt that it is a new factor in development policy.\nThat is why in recent years, more and more attention\nhas focused on the causes and consequences of the\ndigital divide. For example, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme\u2019s Human Development\nReport 2001 concentrated on those problems and was\nthe centre of attention at the 2003 World Summit on\nthe Information Society in Geneva.\nI am very pleased that Estonia has, in a relatively\nshort period of time, achieved a remarkable level in\nseveral areas of information technology. We have\nmanaged to create a favourable environment for\ndevelopment in this field and have ensured that the\nnecessary infrastructure has been created through close\ncooperation between the public sector and the private\nsector, businesses and non-governmental organizations.\nAs a result of this, Estonian citizens of limited means\nnow have access to several information society\nservices. According to \u201cThe Economist\u201d, as of 2004,\nEstonia ranks 26th in the world in e-readiness and\nholds a leading position among Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries. More than half the Estonian\npopulation regularly uses the Internet; 38 per cent own\ncomputers; 80 per cent own mobile phones; 62 per cent\nuse Internet banking; and 59 per cent fill out their tax\nreturns electronically. Estonians can communicate with\nboth the central Government and local governments\nover the Internet and are able to use legally binding\ndigital signatures. All those indicators are in line with\nEuropean Union averages even though Estonia\u2019s gross\ndomestic product remains considerably lower than the\nEuropean average.\nI believe that, as a former country in transition,\nEstonia has experiences which could be very useful for\ndeveloping countries with respect to the promotion of\ninformation and communication technologies. Estonia\nis in a position to provide development assistance, first\n26\n\nand foremost in the form of know-how. We have\nalready taken steps in that direction: in the summer of\n2002 the Government of Estonia, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and the Information\nProgramme of the Open Society Institute jointly set up\nthe Estonian e-Governance Academy. The purpose of\nthat unique Academy is to improve the public-private\ncooperation in the information and communication\ntechnologies. The initial beneficiaries of the project are\nCentral and Eastern European countries, countries of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States and Asian\ncountries, but we already have future plans for African\ncountries as well. The e-Governance Academy has\nalready held training courses for officials from\nKyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Albania, Kazakhstan and other\ncountries.\nThe year 2004 is the final year of the\nInternational Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People.\nI am an Estonian, and as an Estonian I have a specific\nreason to talk about indigenous peoples: we are a\nnation that knows how important it is to preserve and\ndevelop our culture and language. Therefore, I am very\nhappy that recent decades have seen increased\nmomentum in the activities of the United Nations and\nits agencies to protect the rights of indigenous peoples.\nBut the approaching end of the International\nDecade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People must not\nmean diminished attention to the situation of\nindigenous peoples. The rights of indigenous peoples\nmust be codified in international law without further\ndelay. Estonia firmly supports the speedy formulation\nand adoption of a declaration on the rights of\nindigenous peoples. Regardless of the progress that has\nbeen made locally, many of the world\u2019s peoples remain\nuncertain about the preservation of their cultures and\nlanguages. Restrictions on the rights of indigenous\npeoples are one of the reasons behind the emergence of\nhot spots and crises.\nScientists enter endangered species into a Red\nBook in order to help save them from extinction. But\nwe do not yet have a Red Book of peoples. When a\nspecies of wildlife disappears, nature becomes poorer\nand the ecological balance can be damaged. By the\nsame token, the extinction of a people means that the\nwhole world becomes intellectually and culturally\npoorer.\nAnthropologists have used the concept of the\n\u201cfourth world\u201d to refer to the ever increasing\nmarginalization of indigenous peoples and the\ndeterioration of their living conditions. The living\nconditions of Finno-Ugric peoples in their historic\nhomelands provide a worrying example. The Council\nof Europe Parliamentary Assembly has expressed its\nconcerns in that respect. In August this year, the fourth\nWorld Congress of the Finno-Ugric Peoples took place\nin Estonia under the motto \u201cYouth is our future.\u201d The\nfinal document of the Congress expressed concern\nabout the ongoing loss of national identity by Finno-\nUgric peoples and called on the international\ncommunity to devote greater attention to the protection\nof human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples\nand national minorities.\nI would like finally to touch upon the future of\nthe United Nations. The United Nations needs to be\nstrengthened and improved: it needs to be reorganized\nso that it can better respond to new challenges.\nReorganization and increased efficiency would make\nthe Organization more reliable and provide it with\ngreater authority. Here, all Member States share a\ncommon goal: to ensure the steady development of the\nUnited Nations and to effect reforms that would\nenhance its effectiveness as a multilateral organization.\nEstonia firmly supports that process.\nI believe that greater attention should be devoted\nto the prevention of crises and conflicts. We await the\npublication on 1 December of the report of the High-\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which\ncould provide essential guidelines for making the\nUnited Nations function more efficiently in the\nchanged global framework.\nThanks to the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan and the President of the fifty-eighth session,\nJulian Hunte, and thanks to the cooperation of Member\nStates, discussions on revitalization of the work of the\nGeneral Assembly have yielded concrete and desirable\nresults, reflected in resolution 58/316, adopted on\n1 July. That resolution is an essential landmark in the\nprocess of changing and modernizing the General\nAssembly to keep pace with developments in world\nevents. At the fifty-ninth session, under the presidency\nof Mr. Jean Ping, we must continue and intensify our\nefforts in that direction.\nFinally, it is also high time that we moved\nforward with reform of the Security Council, which\n27\n\nwould enable the United Nations to participate more\neffectively in resolving world problems and crises."

        "file_text": "When we met here in\nthe General Assembly last year, it was against the\nbackdrop of the terrible and devastating attack on the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. This year we\nare meeting after a number of terrorist attacks, most\nrecently the gruesome terrorist attack on children on\ntheir very first day of school in Beslan, Russia.\nTerrorism is not a new threat. But the scale and\nbrutality of recent terrorist operations have altered our\nlives and our thinking and forced us to take new\nmeasures to protect ourselves against this threat.\nTerrorism can strike anywhere and at any time.\nTerrorism is a threat to our security; it creates fear and\nwant, and severely hampers economic and social\ndevelopment. No cause, however legitimate, can justify\nacts of terrorism.\nThe fight against terrorism must continue to be a\ntop priority for the United Nations and the world\ncommunity. We must act in accordance with\ninternational law and human rights. Democratic values\nand the rule of law are our strongest cards in the fight\nagainst terror.\nWe, the Members of the United Nations, have a\nresponsibility to make the Organization robust enough\nto address the many tasks we have assigned it. The\nchallenges are many. Unified efforts are needed to\nbring peace and stability to Iraq. Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) stresses that the international\ncommunity must help the new Iraqi Government in its\ncurrent effort to create a better future. However,\nfunctional national democracies and constitutional\ninstitutions are not created by United Nations\nresolutions. In Iraq, they can be created only by the\nIraqis themselves. The international community and\nthe United Nations can, and should, facilitate and assist\nin this process, provided that the necessary security is\nensured. Our Government fully supports the efforts of\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General,\nAshraf Qazi, and his team of dedicated women and\nmen.\nAfghanistan is at a critical juncture. More than\n1,000 people, both Afghans and internationals, have\nbeen killed there so far this year. Reconstruction efforts\nand efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the\nmost vulnerable are being hampered. Development\nactivities are key elements in ensuring stability and\nsecurity. Without security there will be no progress,\nand without progress there will be no security. There is\na continued need for international security forces. The\npolitical process leading to elections is another\nessential requirement for stability. The United Nations\nmust continue to play an important role.\n22\n\nWhile the world is waiting for a political solution\nto the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the\nsituation continues to worsen. The construction of the\nseparation barrier and the expansion of settlements are\nserious threats to the two-State solution.\nThe Israeli plan to withdraw from Gaza and four\nsettlements in the West Bank could be a step in the\nright direction if it is implemented in accordance with\nthe road map and Security Council resolutions, and in\nkeeping with the vision of a two-State solution.\nA viable and well-functioning Palestinian\nAuthority is critical to a peaceful solution to the\nconflict. The Palestinian leaders themselves must\ncontribute by implementing reforms as set out in the\nroad map. The Palestinian Authority has a clear\nresponsibility to fight Palestinian terrorism.\nIn my capacity as Chairman of the Ad Hoc\nLiaison Committee for Assistance to the Palestinian\nPeople, I am encouraged by the many statements that I\nhave heard to the effect that the international\ncommunity stands ready to assist in the implementation\nof the planned withdrawal. However, key issues must\nbe addressed. Most importantly, withdrawal from Gaza\nmust be carried out in a way that is conducive to the\nnormalization of the Palestinian economy.\nNorway, together with other partners in the Ad\nHoc Liaison Committee, will host a donor conference\nbefore the end of the year. I appeal to the States\nMembers of the United Nations to support the\nPalestinian Authority.\nIn Darfur we are facing another crisis, which is\nfirst and foremost a question of the safety and security\nof the civilian population, humanitarian access and the\nprovision of food, medicine and shelter. The concern of\nthe international community was expressed in Security\nCouncil resolution 1564 (2004), adopted on Saturday.\nAll armed groups must cease the violence. The\nNorwegian Government expects the Sudanese\nauthorities to fully comply with Security Council\nresolutions.\nThe Darfur crisis makes it even more important to\ncontinue the Naivasha peace process. A comprehensive\npeace agreement for southern Sudan will lay the\nfoundation for a national solution to the political issues\nin Darfur. We welcome the decision to resume the talks\nbetween the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army in Kenya. We urge them to\nwork without delay to conclude a comprehensive peace\nagreement.\nTargeting humanitarian personnel in conflict\nareas is absolutely unacceptable. Such acts of violence\nconstitute grave breaches of international humanitarian\nlaw. We are being forced to rethink our approach to\nsecurity. It is important, however, to avoid a situation\nwhere overly strict security measures prevent the\nUnited Nations from acting effectively on the ground.\nSuch rules might further distance the civilian\npopulation and therefore result in a loss of legitimacy\nand local support.\nProviding security for United Nations personnel\nis not without costs. When we ask the United Nations\nto carry out difficult tasks in unsafe environments, we\nmust also be willing to cover the expenses involved.\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General\u2019s\nrecommendations on the basis of the report of the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\nThat report will come at a crucial point in time for the\nUnited Nations. The United Nations needs to take\nearlier and more coordinated action as threats to peace\nand security emerge. Such action also needs to be\nsustained in a coordinated and effective fashion.\nWe agree that our collective security system\nneeds reform. Such reform must include, among other\nissues, the sensitive question of Security Council\nenlargement. We hope that a broad set of concrete\nrecommendations by the High-level Panel will enable\nus to agree on measures to better meet current and new\nthreats and challenges. The Panel should take care to\nensure that both hard and soft security issues are\naddressed, as well as the linkages between them.\nMember States have the responsibility to ensure that\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s recommendations, based on the\nreport of the Panel, are actively followed up.\nThe resolution of armed conflicts is not solely the\nprovince of the United Nations. Regional organizations\nalso have significant contributions to make \u2014 and their\ncapacities should be strengthened. The United Nations\nis indispensable in delivering legitimacy. Regional\norganizations, with their local knowledge, are well\nplaced to meet challenges on the ground. Yet the\ninstitutional mechanisms for ensuring effective\npartnership and real burden-sharing between the United\nNations and regional organizations are not in place.\nThis situation must be rectified.\n23\n\nA case in point is the involvement of the African\nUnion (AU) in Sudan. Norway welcomes the response\nto the Darfur crisis by the AU and its member States.\nThe AU mission must be enhanced both by becoming\nmore pro-active and by increasing the number of\nparticipants. Norway has supported the AU and the\nUnited Nations in providing security and humanitarian\nrelief in Darfur. We stand ready to continue to support\nthose efforts.\nI believe that strengthening Africa\u2019s capacity for\npeacekeeping and peace-building is essential if we are\nto deal with the challenges that United Nations\npeacekeeping is facing. For nearly ten years, Norway\nhas contributed to peacekeeping through our Training\nfor Peace in Southern Africa Programme. We plan to\nexpand that programme to West Africa.\nIt is uplifting to see the progress being made in\nmany African countries. We applaud the basic\nprinciples and political priorities being addressed by\nthe New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development and\nwelcome last week\u2019s inauguration of the Pan-African\nParliament. This strengthening of the political\ndimension of regional cooperation testifies to the\ndedication of African leaders and holds promise of an\neven more active and efficient role for the AU in the\nyears to come.\nWithout economic growth there will be no\nimprovement in welfare and wealth distribution, and\nlittle hope of peace and security. International trade\nmay be an important engine for creating growth and\nwelfare. However, this will not happen by itself. A\nsound basis for growth and welfare that benefits all\ncountries can be created only by means of fair trade\nrules developed through international cooperation. In\nthis respect, the World Trade Organization framework\nagreement reached in Geneva in July is a milestone.\nWe avoided any deadlock or setback, and now we can\nrenew our efforts to achieve substantial progress on the\nDoha Development Agenda. I noted that in his speech,\nPresident Lula da Silva said that \u201cIf successful, the\nDoha Round could lift more than 500 million people\nout of poverty\u201d. This certainly shows the opportunities\nof globalization. However, ensuring that economic\ngrowth actually improves the livelihoods of ordinary\npeople requires adequate domestic policies.\nIn an ever more globalized world, we need\nforums to develop the international guidelines\nnecessary to facilitate cooperation. However, we all\nneed to do our part. It has been 10 years since the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange entered into force. More than 120 countries\nhave ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and we are now\nawaiting the ratification that will allow it to enter into\nforce. I welcome the news that Russia is seriously\nconsidering the ratification of the Protocol, but I regret\nthat some countries have not yet been willing to join\nforces in facing one of the most serious global\nchallenges of our time.\nFulfilling the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol\nis a first step towards coming to grips with the\nchallenge of climate change. The entire international\ncommunity, and notably the largest emitters, must\nmake a much more ambitious commitment in this field;\nwe have no time to lose. In the Arctic region we are\nalready experiencing the effects of climate change as\nseen in a temperature rise that is substantially greater\nthan the global average.\nNext year we will take stock of developments\nsince the Millennium Declaration was adopted. This is\nan opportunity to review progress and, where\nnecessary, intensify efforts to fulfil our commitment to\nreducing poverty and achieving development. True\ngender equality and education for all stand out as\ncrucial in this regard. The Summit in 2005 should also\nfocus on international efforts to promote peace-\nbuilding, reconciliation, global security and respect for\nhuman rights. We must take decisive steps during the\nnext General Assembly to meet development targets\nand create a safer and more peaceful world.\nThe United Nations is indispensable as our most\nuniversal and representative organization. Norway has\ndevoted a great deal of effort to building the\nmultilateral system. We are proud of our political and\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations system.\nWe are eager to see the United Nations strengthened\nand reshaped, so that it can remain our most important\ninstrument for addressing global challenges. Norway\nremains committed to supporting the United Nations in\nmeeting those challenges."

        "file_text": "It gives me great\npleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of His\nExcellency Ludwig Scotty, President of the Republic of\nNauru, who had to cancel his trip to New York at the\nlast minute due to pressing matters at home. President\nScotty has asked that I convey to the Assembly the\nwarm greetings and good wishes of the people and the\nGovernment of Nauru, and his warmest congratulations\nto you, Sir, on your assumption of the stewardship of\nthe Assembly. We assure you of Nauru\u2019s fullest\ncooperation in the deliberations that are ahead of us.\nThrough you, Mr. President, my delegation joins\nprevious speakers in congratulating Foreign Minister\nJulian Hunte of Saint Lucia for a productive fifty-\neighth session of the General Assembly and for his\nexemplary performance. As a member of the Alliance\nof Small Island States (AOSIS), Nauru is extremely\nproud to be associated with Saint Lucia and the\nCaribbean Community, and it just goes to show that, as\nis the case of our coconut trees, our potential is great.\nHowever, a lack of resources has limited the capacity\nto flourish of many more people like Julian Hunte from\nthe AOSIS region who are serving or have served in\ninternational office.\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General for his\ncontinued commitment to multilateralism as a means of\nresolving our common problems and for his report on\nthe work of the Organization (A/59/1) over the past 12\nmonths. However, it is discouraging to note that\npeacekeeping activities have had to increase rather than\ndecrease. Human rights and humanitarian norms\ncontinue to be violated as a result of armed conflict and\nterrorism. Atrocious acts of terrorism against innocent\ncivilians, particularly women and children, continue to\ntear the fabric of civility and the moral values on which\neach and every society on this planet is founded.\nNauru sympathizes with those countries and\npeoples who have suffered loss as a result of conflict\nand terrorist acts. Nauru encourages peace in its Asia-\nPacific neighbourhood, and expresses the hope that,\nwhatever their differences, China and Taiwan can\nresolve them peacefully for the sake of the region\u2019s\ncontinued peace, stability and prosperity.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s bold\nstatement of position with respect to the mitigation of\narmed conflicts generally, and those on the African\ncontinent and in the Middle East in particular. We are\npleased to hear that, for the remainder of his term in\n22\n\noffice, he will be focusing mainly on strengthening the\nrule of law and transitional justice. Nauru supports the\nposition the Secretary-General set out in his statement\nlast week at the 3rd meeting, when he said\n\u201cIt is by reintroducing the rule of law, and\nconfidence in its impartial application, that we\ncan hope to resuscitate societies shattered by\nconflict. It is the law, including Security Council\nresolutions, which offers the best foundation for\nresolving prolonged conflicts \u2014 in the Middle\nEast, in Iraq and around the world.\u201d\nThe democratization of governance, the\napplication of accountability and transparency and the\nprotection of minorities and the vulnerable are\ncomplementary elements of ruling under law.\nNauru, like other Member States, looks forward\nwith anticipation to the report of the Secretary-General\non the findings of the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change to be finalized later this year.\nThe Panel has been charged with the task of reviewing\nthreats to peace and security, as well as other global\nchallenges, insofar as they may influence or connect\nwith those threats. Nauru continues to believe that\nmultilateralism is the key to resolving contemporary\nproblems in all of their complexity. Hence, it is\nimportant that the recommendations of the High-level\nPanel reinforce that point and that the proposals are\ndoable and add value to the reform programmes that\nare already in the pipeline, including the revitalization\nof the General Assembly.\nMy delegation has stated in previous debates that\nit agrees fully with the reform of the Security Council.\nThe fresh approach initiated by the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session has, to\nsome extent, injected life back into the debate by\nfocusing on key elements of the reform. It is our hope\nthat the Bureau will continue the push for the further\nconvergence of views by refining the choices that we\nmade during the fifty-eighth session. The formation of\nan informal group of countries with aspirations to\npermanent seats in an expanded Security Council is\ninteresting, and could prove to be a catalyst, expediting\nthe debate on expansion. Nauru can and will support\nthe aspirations of Germany, Japan and India to a\npermanent seat in an expanded Security Council.\nIt is my delegation\u2019s firm view, however, that\nprogress is being held hostage by those countries that\ninsist that the expansion should not be done without\neither eliminating or modifying the veto power\naccorded to permanent members of the Security\nCouncil. Unless this difference in approach is\nreconciled, time and energy spent on other elements of\nthe reform will be futile.\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly must\nhave at its heart the maximization of opportunity for\nequitable representation by all Member States in the\nmajor organs of the United Nations and its committees\nand to ensure that their programme of work allows for\nthe full participation of members, particularly the small\nStates. In that regard, the proposal to split the work of\nthe Main Committees of the General Assembly into\ntwo segments over a six-month period would allow\nsmall States like Nauru, which has only two diplomatic\nstaff, to increase its participation. Nauru would\ntherefore support such a proposal when further\ndeliberations take place later in the session.\nNauru would note that its position is consistent\nwith the United Nations core principle of universality,\nwhich calls on us all to be ever-mindful of the views of\nthose countries seeking expanded responsibilities in\ninternational affairs. Countries that have sterling\nrecords in democracy, human rights, peace and the\nprinciple of freedom should have their achievements,\nas well as their capacities, appropriately recognized.\nAs a small island developing State in the Pacific\nOcean, Nauru aligns itself with the interventions\nalready made by the leaders of countries of the\nAlliance of Small Island States who have spoken\nbefore me on the concerns and challenges that we, the\nsmall-island big-ocean developing States, are facing.\nNauru bears all the unique characteristics of a small\nisland State: smallness in both land area and\npopulation, lack of resources, remoteness and\nvulnerability to exogenous forces, whether man-made\nor natural.\nThe devastation of Niue by Cyclone Heta and the\ndisastrous hurricane destruction in Caribbean countries\nthis year are stark reminders of the vulnerability of\nisland States. Nauru joins others in expressing its\ndeepest sympathy for the loss of life and property in\nthe affected countries of the Caribbean and the\nsouthern coastal states of the United States of America.\nAgainst that background, my delegation would\nlike to focus on what it considers to be a spanner in the\nwheel of negotiations on an outcome strategy paper for\nthe International Meeting to Review the\n23\n\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, to be held in Mauritius. It appears to us that the\nprogramme for political recognition of the special case\nof small island developing States (SIDS), as outlined at\nthe Barbados Conference in 1994, and reinforced in\nNew York during the five-year review held in 1999, as\nwell as in chapter VII of the Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation, has taken a backseat in the\nnegotiations to generic undertakings made at other\ninternational conferences on development since\n1999 \u2014 in particular, the Millennium Development\nGoals of 2000 and the Monterrey Consensus of 2002.\nBenchmarking the SIDS outcome strategy paper to the\nlatter agreed texts would be hypocrisy of a high order\ninsofar as political acceptance of SIDS as a special\ncase is concerned. Indeed, the slow progress in the\nimplementation by many small island developing\nStates of the measures called for in those texts is but a\ntrue reflection that our problems are SIDS-specific and\ngo deeper than the generic issues of development.\nNauru is also concerned that some of the\ndevelopment partners would skew the review into one\naddressing SIDS-Millennium Development Goal\nperformance instead of SIDS performance on the\nBarbados Programme of Action. I believe that our\nconcern has to an extent been warranted and therefore\nmy delegation would like to use this opportunity to\nremind our partners that the review is about identifying\nand solving the failure of small island developing\nStates to accomplish agreed development programmes\nunder the Barbados Plan of 1994; and it\u2019s about how\nyou, our development partners, can help SIDS to attain\nthose goals. It is therefore our sincere hope that the\nthird and critical round of negotiations scheduled in\nearly October will be conducted in the right spirit and\nwith better understanding.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum continues to be the\nvehicle for regional cooperation and collaboration\namong the 16 Pacific Island countries of the Central\nand Western Pacific. It approved the terms of reference\nfor the Pacific plan at the Apia Forum last month to\nrevitalize the Forum and to make it more effective in\nits response to the needs of the peoples of the region.\nIssues such as climate change, peace and security, the\neconomic and social development of our peoples and\nthe protection and sustainable use of the environment\nand our natural resources are still the priorities of the\nForum.\nNauru welcomes the admission of the Kingdom\nof Thailand as the thirteenth member of the Forum\u2019s\ndialogue partners. That group of countries, along with\nthe European Union, individual member countries of\nthe EU and the United Nations specialized agencies\nand programmes, are critical to the development of the\nregion as they provide the necessary financial backing.\nDuring the session, cooperation between the United\nNations and the Pacific Islands Forum will be\nconsidered under item 56 (q) of the General\nAssembly\u2019s agenda. The Pacific Island Forum group at\nthe United Nations looks forward to working closely\nwith Member States to develop and expand the areas of\nits cooperation with them, pursuant to a draft\nresolution that will be presented to the Assembly in\ndue course.\nNauru, like the other low-lying small island\nStates, sees the Kyoto Protocol as its means of\nsalvation from the sea-level rise and climate change\nthat threaten to devastate its already fragile ecosystem,\nso essential to the livelihood and culture of its people.\nMy delegation understands that the Russian Federation\nstands between the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s coming into force\nand its continuing to linger in the wilderness. Nauru\nwelcomes the statement by the Foreign Minister of the\nRussian Federation that President Putin has ordered\nserious consideration of Russia\u2019s ratification of the\nProtocol. That is a step forward from last year.\nA healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable use\nof its natural resources, including the highly migratory\nfish stocks, are also critical to our livelihood. We in the\nPacific have \u201cwalked the walk\u201d on those issues by the\ndevelopment of an ocean policy to guide us in the\nmanagement of our part of the Pacific Ocean and to\nform the framework for future regional ocean-related\ninitiatives. The Convention on the Conservation and\nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\nWestern and Central Pacific Ocean, which provides a\ncomprehensive regime for the management of the\nregion\u2019s highly migratory fish stock both in our\nexclusive economic zone and on the high seas, has\ncome into force. In addition, the trans-shipment of\nnuclear waste through our waters is of great concern to\nmany of the island countries because of the damage it\ncould cause.\nOne of the positive outcomes of the Pacific\nIslands Forum meeting last month was the decision of\nthe Forum leaders to intervene in the internal economic\ncrisis in Nauru at the request of our Government and\n24\n\nconsistent with the terms of reference of the Forum\u2019s\nBiketawa Declaration of 2000. Our crisis lies largely in\nthe fact that two thirds of our workforce are in the\nemploy of the Government and its agencies. Those\nemployees have not been paid a regular salary for over\na year now. At irregular intervals either A$ 100 in food\nvouchers or A$ 30 to A$ 50 in cash to purchase food\nhas been paid out, compared with the basic wage of\nA$ 350 \u2014 or about US$ 250 \u2014 per fortnight. The\naverage family size on Nauru is around six people. A$\n50 cash fortnightly is equivalent to US$ 0.42 per\nfamily member per day and is well below the United\nNations-defined abject poverty level of US$ 1 a day.\nThe fact that many Nauruans can harvest food\nfrom the sea and the land, however limited, coupled\nwith our culture and tradition of sharing, has meant\nthat despite the lack of cash our people eat at least once\na day. The real problem concerns the level of daily\nnutritional intake, particularly for children, as one\ncannot buy imported commodities such as fruits and\nvegetables and hygienic supplies. The situation is\nexacerbated by the fact that Nauru imports 90 per cent\nof all food and other essential items. Accordingly, food\nsecurity in the medium to long term is a serious\nconcern as there is no form of agricultural activity on\nNauru.\nNauru\u2019s recovery cannot be possible without the\nestablishment of reputable financial institutions on\nNauru and the lifting of the restrictions on financial\ntransactions between the international community and\nNauru. That will not happen if Nauru continues to be\nsubjected to countermeasures and blacklisting by the\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF). Despite the\noutlawing of the registration of foreign banks some 12\nmonths ago, Nauru has not been successful in its\nappeal no longer to be the subject of countermeasures\nas a first step, although there has been incremental\nprogress towards that goal over the same period.\nFollowing the visit by the International Monetary Fund\nearly this year, Nauru has, for the fourth time, passed\nan anti-money-laundering law that now supersedes\nprevious laws. We have participated in FATF regional\nreviews but, despite strong support provided by actions\ntaken on advice, we seem to have failed at the plenary\nreview.\nAs I speak, the Parliament of Nauru is\nconsidering the passage of three bills addressing issues\nraised by the FATF: the counter-terrorism and\ntransnational organized crime bill, the proceeds of\ncrime bill and the mutual assistance in criminal matters\nbill. We are confident that the passage of those bills,\nthe prioritizing of related issues through the\nappointment of an anti-money-laundering national\ncoordinating committee \u2014 which also comprises the\nAustralian official appointed as secretary for\nfinance \u2014 and the coordinating committee\u2019s face-to-\nface meeting with FATF\u2019s Asia-Pacific Working Group\nin Brunei next week will bring us closer to our\nobjective of being de-listed. We will persevere, as we\nknow that, in the end, we will prevail.\nThe intervention by the Pacific Islands Forum is\nseen as pre-empting the possibility of the economic\ncrisis escalating into a security and safety issue for the\nNauruan people and for the region. Teams of regional\nexperts representing the Forum and Australia have\nvisited Nauru on a fact-finding mission, and we will be\nreporting to the leaders in due course, which will\ninclude recommendations on the type of assistance and\nthe manner in which it should be rendered. While the\nproposal, which is to be formally known as Pacific\nRegional Assistance to Nauru, is being finalized, the\nForum has agreed to provide, in the immediate future,\ncapacity-building assistance in the justice, judicial,\nfinancial audit and national planning sectors, as well as\ntransportation for the health and education sectors and\na small cash grant to assist with public-sector wages.\nThat assistance is complementing the aid\nprovided separately by Australia, which has deployed\nAustralian finance and treasury officials to head the\nNauru Department of Finance, and the deployment,\nnext month, of Australian police to take command of\nthe Nauru Police Force. Indeed, as I speak, the\nParliament of Nauru is also considering a reform\nbudget designed with the assistance of Australian\nfinance and treasury officials. That budget includes\nharsh but realistic measures as a preliminary but\ndecisive step towards stabilizing, and eventually\nrebuilding, the economy and society of Nauru.\nFor the same reasons, the Government of Nauru\nwrote to the Secretary-General in August of this year to\nalert him of the looming crisis in Nauru and to request\nassistance from the United Nations system to help to\nalleviate the plight of the Nauruan people. President\nLudwig Scotty and Foreign Minister David Adeang\nmay be visiting New York in the latter part of October\nto meet with the Secretary-General and relevant United\nNations bodies on this matter. My Government looks\nforward to receiving a positive response from the\n25\n\nUnited Nations system, in the same manner as it did\nfrom the Pacific Islands Forum.\nIn conclusion, the fifty-ninth session has critical\nwork ahead of it, such as the International Meeting for\nthe 10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction, the introduction and deliberation on the\nfindings of the High-Level Panel constituted by the\nSecretary-General, the review of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the\npreparations for the 5-year review of the Millennium\nDeclaration and its Goals and the continuation of our\ndeliberations on the revitalization of the General\nAssembly and of the reform of the Security Council, to\nname but a few items.\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, the United\nNations is at a fork in the road in terms of its relevance\nas an organization of nations seeking common\nsolutions to common problems. The next 12 months\nwill determine whether we, the united nations of the\nworld, continue on the road where \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d\nis the mode of operation or whether we follow the road\nof multilateralism as the principal rule of our\nengagement. The statements thus far indicate the latter,\nbut we have heard that before."

        "file_text": "It is\nmy honour to read out the statement of Mr. Zine El\nAbidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of Tunisia\nand Chairman of the sixteenth session of the Arab\nLeague Council, who had wanted to attend this meeting\nbut was detained by urgent commitments. The\nstatement reads as follows:\n\u201cIt is my distinct pleasure to convey to you,\nSir, and to your sisterly country, the Republic of\nGabon, my sincere congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at\nthis session. We wish you every success.\n\u201cI also wish to express to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian Hunte, my great appreciation for his\nexcellent management of the proceedings of the\nprevious session.\n\u201cI also take this opportunity to convey my\nthanks and appreciation to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for his commendable efforts to\npromote the role of the Organization and to fulfil\nits objectives of establishing security and peace\nthroughout the world.\n\u201cTunisia reiterates its commitment to the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations\nCharter and reaffirms its steady resolve to\ncontinue to contribute to all efforts to reform the\nOrganization and to develop its structures, the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council in\nparticular, so that it can remain the guarantor of\nthe application of international law and the\nconsolidation of justice, stability and\ndevelopment throughout the world.\n\u201cFaced with rising tensions in many regions\nof the world, the widening development gap\nbetween countries and the serious challenges\nconfronting humankind, the international\ncommunity is called upon to reorganize\ninternational relations in accordance with a new\nvision based on cooperation, solidarity and\ncoexistence among all peoples. That is the\napproach which we sought to develop at the\nSummit Conference of the Arab League Council\nhosted by my country on 22 and 23 May, the\ncurrent session of which we have the honour of\nchairing.\n\u201cIn addition to the outcome of the Arab\nSummit, which represents a qualitative leap in the\nsystem of joint Arab action, the Arab States sent\na clear message to the international community.\nIn it, they reaffirmed their commitment to a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace as a strategic\noption in settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, based\non the Arab peace initiative, international\nlegality, the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil and the implementation of the road map.\nThe community of Arab States is determined to\nintensify its international activities to reactivate\nthe Arab peace initiative and to rally international\nsupport for it.\n\u201cThe serious escalation of the situation in\nthe occupied Palestinian territories and Israel\u2019s\nstubborn imposition of a policy of fait accompli\nand unilateral measures require the international\ncommunity to act promptly to end the violence\nagainst and provide international protection for\nthe brotherly Palestinian people, to lift the siege\nimposed on its legitimate leadership, to cease the\nbuilding of settlements and to recognize the\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of\nJustice declaring the construction of the\nseparation wall illegal and calling for its\ndemolition. We believe that this would help to\ncreate conditions conducive to the establishment\nof a new era of confidence and understanding\namong all parties in the region in which the peace\nprocess can be resumed, the brotherly Palestinian\npeople can recover its legitimate rights and\nestablish its independent State, and Syria and\nLebanon can recover all of their occupied\nterritories.\n\u201cWhile renewing its commitment to\nsupporting Iraq\u2019s national unity and respect for its\nsovereignty and independence, the community of\nArab States stresses the need for the United\nNations to assume its vital role in that sisterly\ncountry. In the framework of the League of Arab\nStates, we will continue to support international\nefforts to demonstrate the solidarity of the Arab\nworld with the Iraqi people as our contribution to\nestablishing security and stability in that country\nand creating conditions conducive to its\nreconstruction.\n7\n\n\u201cThe Arab countries also support the efforts\nmade at the United Nations and regional levels,\nand in particular by the African Union, to achieve\nunity, peace and development in the brotherly\nSudan. They also welcome the steps taken by the\nSudanese Government to honour its commitments\nunder the agreement to re-establish security and\nstability in Darfur, signed on 3 July 2004 with the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\n\u201cThe Arab Summit was an historic occasion\nat which the Arab States reaffirmed the fact that\nfinding just solutions to the fundamental\nproblems of the region that have adversely\naffected world peace and security would reinforce\nthe instincts of its peoples for security and peace,\nenhance the development process, update and\nconsolidate the principles of human rights and\ndemocracy, and promote the role and status of\nwomen in society, in conformity with each\ncountry\u2019s cultural specificities, conditions and\nabilities, and based on its own free will and\ncommitment to shared humanitarian values.\n\u201cGiven the Arab States\u2019 conviction of the\nimportance of the economic and social\ndimensions in strengthening the process of\nbuilding the pan-Arab system, our Arab Summit\nhas decided to establish a common strategy for\neconomic and social action and a plan to fight\npoverty and reinforce development efforts. In so\ndoing, it has demonstrated its resolve to\ncontribute to implementing the decisions of the\nMillennium Summit. The Arab States\u2019 call for the\narticulation of a new concept of cooperation- and\nsolidarity-based partnership with all countries of\nthe world consecrates the path of dialogue among\ncultures and anchors the values of tolerance,\nunderstanding and complementarity among them.\n\u201cOur States and peoples hope that the\ninternational community and the influential\nparties will step up their endeavours to settle the\npending issues in the region, support the efforts\nof countries to upgrade their economies, and\npromote their development and social\nprogrammes in the framework of cooperation and\ncoordination between the United Nations and the\nLeague of Arab States.\n\u201cTunisia is eager to contribute to the\npromotion of joint Arab action and seeks to give\nnew impetus to regional cooperation. In that\ncontext, we and our brother leaders of the\nMaghreb States are seeking to reactivate the\nMaghreb Union, which is an irreversible strategic\nchoice and a legitimate aspiration, shared by all\nthe peoples of the region, to greater\ncomplementarity and solidarity. Our country is\nalso eager to continue contributing to building the\nstructures of the African Union, strengthening the\nfoundations of security and stability in Africa,\nand establishing economic and social cooperation\namong African countries. That will effectively\nhelp our countries to achieve integration in the\nmarch towards prosperity and progress and to\ncreate genuine partnerships with regional\ngroupings throughout the world.\n\u201cAt the Mediterranean level, the \u2018five plus\nfive\u2019 summit involving the Maghreb countries\nand European countries of the southern\nMediterranean, held in Tunis in December 2003,\nhas made a fresh start for cooperation and\nsolidarity-based partnership among them in the\ncontext of establishing security and stability and\nof achieving economic complementarity, cultural\nand social communication, and constructive\npolitical dialogue. Serving as coordinator of the\ncommunity of Arab States within the Euro-\nMediterranean process, Tunisia strives to inject\nmore efficiency and vitality into the process so as\nto consolidate the foundations of security,\nstability and development within the Euro-\nMediterranean area.\n\u201cThe World Solidarity Fund for poverty\neradication, created on the basis of a Tunisian\nproposal of 1999 and adopted by the General\nAssembly on 20 December 2002, reflects\nTunisia\u2019s ongoing commitment to anchoring the\nprinciples of justice, solidarity and sustainable\ndevelopment in the world, based on our\nsuccessful pioneering national experience in that\nfield over many years. We believe that the Fund,\nwhich has become a United Nations mechanism,\nrequires all members of the international\ncommunity, including Governments, civil society\nand private sectors, to pool their efforts and\nswiftly mobilize the financial resources necessary\nto activate it.\n\u201cIn that context, we suggest the\nproclamation of 20 December of each year as the\n8\n\nworld day for the fight against poverty, in\ncommemoration of the date of the General\nAssembly\u2019s adoption of the resolution\nestablishing the Fund and in order to enshrine the\nconcept of solidarity as a permanent universal\nvalue in international relations. We also welcome\nany initiative in support of the activation of the\nFund. In that regard, we take special note of the\ninitiative of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\nof the Federal Republic of Brazil.\n\u201cTunisia\u2019s sustained efforts to provide\noptimum conditions for the hosting of the second\nphase of the World Summit on the Information\nSociety on 16 to 18 November 2005 are also\nbeing undertaken in that context. We called for\nthe convening of such a summit in 1998, based on\nour conviction that, today more than ever before,\nour world needs to establish a solidarity-based\ndigital partnership, allowing all countries to be\nintegrated into the international information\nsociety. In that way, we hope to achieve a more\njust and balanced approach as a strong\ndevelopment and cultural bridge between the\ncountries of the world, in fulfilment of the goals\nand principles of the Millennium Summit.\n\u201cI should like to take this opportunity to\nreiterate my earlier invitation to heads of State\nand Government, to representatives of civil\nsociety and the private sector and to other\ninternational organizations, extended at the first\nphase of the World Summit on the Information\nSociety held in Geneva in December 2003, to\nparticipate actively in the Tunis Summit in order\nto ensure its success and to achieve the prosperity\nand well-being of all humankind.\n\u201cThe General Assembly\u2019s adoption of the\nTunisian proposal to proclaim 2005 the\nInternational Year of Sport and Physical\nEducation was a recognition of the importance of\nthose two activities in strengthening the bonds of\nfriendship, cooperation and rapprochement\namong peoples and in further disseminating peace\nand development throughout the world. We are\nconvinced that all countries recognize the noble\ndimensions of the proclamation and will spare no\neffort to formalize it within their national\nprogrammers next year.\n\u201cThe increasing danger of the phenomenon\nof terrorism in our times requires greater\ninternational coordination in resisting that\nscourge and averting its threats by treating its\nroot causes, finding just solutions to several\noutstanding international problems, and curbing\npoverty, exclusion and marginalization in the\nworld. Tunisia is convinced that international\nrelations can prosper and develop only in a\nclimate of dialogue, entente and solidarity,\neschewing fanaticism, extremism and the dangers\nof discord and warfare and in a context of justice,\nmutual respect and equitable cooperation among\nindividuals, groups and peoples. Thus, security,\npeace and stability may prevail throughout the\nworld and humankind may look to the future with\nthe utmost confidence, optimism and ambition.\u201d"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of Bhutan, allow me to congratulate you,\nSir, on your election to your important post. I assure\nyou of my delegation\u2019s support and cooperation as you\nguide the work of this important body for the year. We\nare confident that, with your vast experience and able\nleadership, our deliberations will be productive. May I\ncommend Mr. Julian R. Hunte for his stewardship and\ncontribution to the work of the fifty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly.\nThe task before the fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly is daunting, given the array of\nissues and challenges facing the international\ncommunity. Among them is the issue of reform of the\nUnited Nations. In that regard, the General Assembly\u2019s\nresolutions on the revitalization of its work and the\nreform initiatives in other organs and agencies are\ntimely and welcome, as they will serve to ensure the\nUnited Nations continued relevance and effectiveness\nin a rapidly changing world. My delegation looks\nforward to the recommendations of the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change set up by the\nSecretary-General to examine the current challenges to\npeace and security.\nMuch of the ongoing debate on United Nations\nreforms has justifiably centred on the reform of the\nSecurity Council as the organ charged with the\n9\n\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In a\nworld torn by old and new conflicts, the Security\nCouncil must evolve in order to remain effective and to\nenjoy the confidence of all member States. Its\ncomposition must change to reflect the wider\nmembership of the United Nations and the new\ngeopolitical and economic realities of the present-day\nworld. Bhutan supports the call for an expanded\nSecurity Council through increased membership of\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories.\nAmong others, Bhutan strongly believes that India and\nJapan, in view of the important roles they play in\ninternational affairs, are pre-eminently qualified for\npermanent membership in an expanded Council.\nThe toll of innocent human beings falling prey to\nterrorism continues to mount by the day. Gruesome\nacts of terrorism in different regions of the world,\nincluding the recent brutal killing of schoolchildren in\nBeslan and the cold-blooded murder of Nepalese and\nother innocent people in Iraq and elsewhere, have\nraised the level of horror to new heights. We strongly\ncondemn those senseless killings. Even my country has\nnot been spared the scourge. Having exhausted all\npeaceful means to prevail upon the heavily armed\nforeign militant groups from north-eastern India to\nleave our territory, the Royal Government was\ncompelled to use force to remove them in mid-\nDecember 2003. Most recently, two people were killed\nand 27 injured by a bomb blast in a marketplace in a\nborder town in southern Bhutan.\nThere is an urgent need to take concerted action\nto fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nEvery nation gathered here, by having signed the\nCharter of the United Nations, ascribes to the universal\ncode that the methods which terrorists employ to\nachieve their aims, especially the targeting and killing\nof innocent civilians, cannot be justified.\nConflicts and crisis situations continue to disrupt\nthe political stability, security and socio-economic\nwell-being of millions around the world. Many such\nconflicts are fuelled by conditions of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. Recognizing that interrelationship,\nthe international community has taken numerous\ninitiatives in recent years. Several major conferences\nhave been convened, including the Millennium\nSummit, that have provided a comprehensive set of\ntime-bound targets to be achieved in order to secure a\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world.\nHowever, those targets remain distant for many\nand the gap between the rich and the poor is getting\nwider among and within nations. The Global\nMonitoring Report 2004 of the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund indicates that economic\ngrowth in many developing countries remains below\nthe level considered necessary to reach the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. If the Goals are to be achieved by\nthe target date, the report states, all parties urgently\nneed to do much more. The Monterrey Consensus\nreinforced the objectives of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and emphasized the roles of all\nparties involved in the process of financing for\ndevelopment. While developing countries have to\naccelerate reforms, developed countries must provide\nmore aid, foreign direct investment, debt relief and\nmore open access to their markets.\nIt is against that background that my delegation\nwelcomes the 2005 high-level plenary meeting to\nreview the integrated follow-up and implementation of\nthe outcomes of the United Nations conferences and\nsummits. My delegation hopes that the review will lead\nto further concrete action by all stakeholders.\nFurthermore, as a landlocked, least developed country,\nmy delegation hopes to see the issues and challenges\nidentified in the Almaty and Brussels Programmes of\nAction receive the highest priority during the review.\nMay I mention that the Royal Government of\nBhutan, under the leadership of His Majesty the King\nand guided by the development philosophy of gross\nnational happiness, has been making concerted efforts\nto ensure the all-round development of the country and\nto realize the agreed goals of the various international\nconferences, in particular the Millennium Summit. I\nam pleased to report that, with the continued support of\nour development partners, Bhutan is hopeful of\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.\nIn that regard, I take this opportunity to express the\ndeep appreciation of the Royal Government and people\nof Bhutan to the United Nations and other donors for\ntheir contributions to the development of my country.\nAs I conclude my statement, I would like to pay\ntribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis strong leadership and relentless efforts to advance\nthe cause of peace, development and security. We will\ncontinue to benefit from his vision and leadership for\nthe next two years. As he leaves his post at the end of\n2006, our work to find a suitable replacement to lead\nthe United Nations has to begin soon and in earnest.\n10\n\nMy delegation believes that, in keeping with the\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation, and\nin consideration of Asia\u2019s being the most populous\ncontinent with the largest regional grouping of 55\nmembers in the United Nations, a Secretary-General\nfrom Asia would be both timely and appropriate."

        "file_text": "It is my special pleasure to\naddress the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly\nof the United Nations. This universal forum has\nenabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and\nharmonize their efforts in preserving peace and\nsecurity, in achieving prosperity and upholding the\nvalues of human civilization.\nI would like to congratulate you, Mr. President,\non being elected to preside over this august body and\nto express my confidence in your successful\nleadership.\nI would also like, on behalf of Albania, to convey\nto the Secretary-General our highest appreciation for\nhis leading contribution to the fulfilment of the\nhistorical mission of the United Nations and to the\naspirations of our peoples for a better world in which\nonly peace, democracy and economic prosperity reign.\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place\nin a milestone year for Europe. Only a few months ago,\na historic event vitalized the dream of a more united\nand stronger Europe. Ten European countries, sharing a\ncommon aspiration for integration, were admitted into\nthe European Union.\nThe Albanian Government and society are\nengaged in an all-round European integration process,\nand they are carrying out necessary reforms with the\nnecessary political will and drive.\nAlbania is working to strengthen the democratic\ninstitutions and capacities of its central and local\ngovernment with a view to bringing its legislation and\nconditions into line with European Union standards,\nprogressively achieving concrete and measurable\nresults, as previously defined.\nDetermined to make our contribution to regional\nand global security, the Albanian Government\nconsiders the country's integration into NATO to be\none of its major objectives. The NATO Istanbul\nSummit last June commended the progress made by my\ncountry in this regard and encouraged the deepening of\nreforms. It welcomed Albania's contribution to\nregional stability and cooperation and committed to\nassess our further progress at the next NATO summit,\nwhich would hopefully mark the start of negotiations\nfor our full membership in the alliance. We believe that\nthe commitments set up in the framework of the\nAdriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO\n38\n\nstandards, to the benefit of regional stability and\nsecurity.\nWe remain truly convinced that the respect and\nprotection of human rights and freedoms are the main\npillars of a pluralist democratic society. The\nGovernment of the Republic of Albania will continue\nto constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full\nimplementation of the standards enshrined in the\nUnited Nations and Council of Europe conventions, as\nwell as the relevant documents of regional\norganizations, such as the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe, in which we are playing a\nvery active role. We will continue to do so in the future\nas well. By adopting contemporary legislation and by\nbecoming a party to other recently adopted\ninternational instruments on human rights, Albania has\nassociated itself with countries that are enforcing a\nnumber of national strategies and programmes focusing\non specific population groups, especially women,\nchildren, persons in need and minorities, among others.\nIn recent years, the Albanian Government has\nstarted to periodically submit reports to the committees\nof the six main United Nations human rights treaties\nand is taking their recommendations into serious\nconsideration. It is our belief that these international\nmechanisms play a significant and important role as\nguardians of the common human values we have\ntogether adopted.\nAlbania, as one of the 191 signatory countries of\nthe Millennium Declaration, remains fully committed\nto implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals, which have been properly reflected in a national\nstrategy for social and economic development. The\npattern of our sustained economic growth, which is at 6\nto 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year, is a good\nsupport base for the whole society to maintain higher\nstandards of respect for human rights and to fight\npoverty and crime. I would like to take this opportunity\nto thank the United Nations specialized agencies for\ntheir valuable assistance in support of the\nimplementation of these objectives nationwide and on\na central and local level.\nThe Albanian Government is pleased to note that\nan ever-healthier climate of confidence and relations of\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in\nthe South-Eastern European region. The countries of\nthe region are fully engaged in a process that will lead\nus clearly toward Euro-Atlantic integration and at the\nsame time continually remove us from the extremist\ntendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last\ndecade. The regional policy of my Government is\nguided by the motto: 'the more integrated in the\nregion, the more integrated in Europe.' In\nimplementing this policy, Albania is cooperating as\nnever before with all the countries of the region by\nmaking borders less relevant, opening up to one\nregional market the implementation of free trade\nagreements and free movement corridors, and\nstimulating foreign direct investment. We are\nespecially cooperating with the common fight against\norganized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking. In\nthe meantime, Albania is reinforcing its border\nmanagement and control, guided by the European\nUnion and NATO standards.\nMy country will hold general parliamentary\nelections by the middle of next year. We are committed\nto doing all that is required to ensure that the election\nprocess is fully compatible with international standards\nfor free and fair elections. To that end, we are\ncommitted to continuing to work with relevant\nspecialized institutions on elections by fully\nimplementing especially OSCE/Office for Democratic\nInstitutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)\nrecommendations. For us, the process and standards\nare more important than the results of the elections.\nIn the context of strengthening regional\ncooperation, my country is committed to a more\nenhanced partnership with all regional organizations\nand initiatives that serve the promotion of good\nneighbourly relations; the strengthening of regional\npeace, security and stability; ensuring political support\nfor integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, and\nattracting financing for national and regional projects\nin priority fields such as energy, transportation and\ntelecommunications.\nOn its path towards European integration, the\nSouth-East European region is still facing pending\nchallenges, such as the future of Kosovo. Albania\ngreatly appreciates the recent democratic and\nintegration developments in Kosovo, thanks to the\nefforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of\nits self-governing institutions with the United Nations\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\nAllow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren\nJessen-Petersen, Special Representative for Kosovo of\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, in assuming this\nvery important duty.\n39\n\nThe Albanian Government shares the view that\nthe time has come for a rapid and coherent\nimplementation of the policy of standards of a\nmultiethnic democracy and European status for\nKosovo. This would be the key to the solution of a\nnumber of other issues. We truly hope that the question\nof the final status of Kosovo will reach a final solution\nsoon, for the sake of the people of Kosovo and for the\nenhancement of the Europeanization process of the\nwhole region.\nIn the meantime, we support all efforts to build a\ndemocratic and multicultural society in Kosovo that is\ngoverned by the rule of law, ethnic and religious\ntolerance and cohabitation. Particularly helpful in this\nregard would be the further energizing of UNMIK\u00eds\ntransfer of authority to the legitimate institutions of\nKosovo that are already being anchored to European\nintegration agendas.\nWe believe that in the upcoming October\nparliamentary elections, the Albanian and other ethnic\ncommunities of Kosovo will demonstrate their best\nvalues, taking a major step toward the consolidation of\nmultiethnic democracy in the region. We also hope that\nthe Serbian minority in Kosovo will assume its\nresponsibilities and, through a free vote, make their\ncontribution to the European future of Kosovo. Their\nparticipation in all levels of the democratic institutions\nof Kosovo would further contribute to the\nconsolidation of peace, stability and the European\nperspective in the whole region.\nMy Government supports a stimulation of direct\ndialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, both on\npolitical and technical issues. This is fundamental in\nresolving the pending problems and is in accordance\nwith the spirit of regional and European integration.\nThe tragic terrorist attack one year ago in\nBaghdad, which took the lives of 22 people, including\nUnited Nations Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieira\nde Mello, is still fresh in our memories. Such hideous\nand punishable acts, which continued in the following\ndays and months there and in other countries of the\nworld, such as Turkey, Spain, Russia, Indonesia and\nothers, show that terrorism is today the biggest threat\nto international peace and security, to stability and to\nthe values of world democracy and civilization.\nIn the global effort to combat terrorism, our\ncountries have already understood that, first of all, it\ncannot be identified with one people, one religion, one\nrace or only certain groups of society. We believe that\nthe fight against terrorism will only be successful if we\njoin efforts. In that context, we support the\nstrengthening of international cooperation among\nStates and international organizations, in which the\nUnited Nations has an irreplaceable role.\nThe Albanian Government has been consistently\ncommitted to making its contribution as an active\nmember of the international coalition against terrorism.\nWe have peacekeeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWe have signed, ratified and now are implementing 12\nUnited Nations conventions and protocols against\nterrorism. We are doing the same with the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, cooperating with\nand presenting regular reports to the Council. The\nAlbanian Government salutes the decision of the\nSecurity Council to play a more active role in the fight\nagainst threats stemming from the possession and\ntrafficking of weapons of mass destruction. We support\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004).\nAlbania has, on the other hand, taken all\nmeasures for the implementation of the Code of\nConduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive\nSources of the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA), convinced that this international instrument is\nextremely important to preventing threats stemming\nfrom the misuse of radioactive materials. Albania has\nalready taken the decision and will soon sign the\nProtocol Additional to the Safeguards Agreement of\nthe IAEA. This year, Albania also joined the\nProliferation Security Initiative, with its respective\ncommitments that will create benefits for all.\nPeace and stability have not been fully\nestablished in certain regions of the world. The United\nNations and the Security Council are the authorities\nmandated by the Charter to preserve peace and security\nglobally. It is only natural that crisis-solving solutions\nand initiatives in such hot spots around the globe as\nIraq, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Sudan and so on\nremain high on their agenda. We believe that a more\nactive engagement of the international community is\nrequired in finding the most suitable and lasting\nsolutions for those crisis situations, as is the further\nenhancement of the role and effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations structures.\nIn that regard, the Albanian Government\nwelcomed the unanimous adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June on Iraq, approving the\n40\n\nprovisional Government of Iraq and transferring to it\nauthority and sovereignty, the independence and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, Iraqi Government control of\nthe armed forces and, in particular, the holding of\ndemocratic elections in early 2005. The progress made\nin Iraq is due to the cooperation between the Iraqi\nGovernment forces and those of the Coalition. We\nwould wish, however, to see a further lowering of\ntensions and a full stop to violence. We would wish for\nincreased security, more stability and the establishment\nof a democratic society.\nThat is why we strongly condemn the strategy of\nviolence and hostage-taking to achieve political goals,\nsometimes cloaked under a religious veil, and we join\nour voice to those of all the international actors that\nhave called for an immediate stop to those acts. The\nAlbanian Government supports the efforts of the\nUnited Nations to provide the assistance necessary to\nbuild national democratic institutions in Iraq and to the\nholding of free and democratic elections early next\nyear.\nMy Government also follows with great concern\nthe developments in the Middle East. Like the whole\ninternational community, we hope to see an end put to\nthe deterioration of the situation in the occupied\nPalestinian territories, where violence towards the\ncivilian population is increasingly claiming innocent\nlives, especially those of women and children. On the\nother hand, we condemn any terrorist act against the\ncivilian population, irrespective of whose name it is\ncommitted in.\nThe Albanian Government strongly believes that\npeace can and should be achieved only through\ndialogue and negotiation. We are convinced that the\nSecurity Council, the Quartet and the international\ncommunity have the authority and the capacity to\nestablish a stable peace in Palestine and throughout the\nMiddle East based on the Security Council\u00eds\nresolutions and the road map. The international\ncommunity should continue to monitor closely the\nimplementation of the road map in order to avoid any\ndeviation from or change, misinterpretation or blocking\nof it by the parties to the conflict.\nCurrent developments and realities in the\ninternational arena, and the acute problems and\nchallenges we are all facing \u00f3 such as preserving\npeace and security, facing the threats and dangers of\nterrorism, the fight against poverty and fatal diseases,\nthe effects of globalization and environmental\ndegradation \u00f3 have increasingly sharpened the need to\nrevitalize our Organization. The Albanian Government\nis fully supportive of the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral to reform the Organization, in particular the\ninitiatives taken regarding the reform of the Security\nCouncil. We join with the voices that call for a stronger\nUnited Nations and for more efficient organs and\nmechanisms engaged in monitoring the implementation\nof obligations by United Nations Member States, in\nparticular those concerning global security.\nWe therefore think that the time has come to have\na more representative, more transparent and more\nflexible Security Council that could better reflect\ncurrent realities. Its enlargement with permanent and\nnon-permanent members would increase the\npossibilities for all States Members of the United\nNations to contribute to the preservation of\ninternational peace and stability. It would be a\nsignificant step towards the completion of United\nNations reform.\nMy country is willing to contribute further to the\nactivities of the United Nations, especially in the\nglobal and regional agendas related to sustainable\neconomic and social development and the protection of\nfundamental freedoms and human rights universally.\nTo that end, Albania has modestly presented for the\nfirst time its candidacy to become a member of the\nEconomic and Social Council for the period\n2005-2007. We hope we shall succeed.\nA few weeks ago, the whole world witnessed the\nsuccessful conclusion of the Olympic Games in\nAthens. Gathered around the Olympic torch, sportsmen\nand women demonstrated how closely nations can\nstand with one another and how we can get rid of\nhatred and conflict from our midst. Let the symbol of\nOlympic peace and fraternity help us to build a better,\nmore secure world for us and for generations to come."

        "file_text": "Allow me to convey\nto all members of the United Nations family the warm\ngreetings and best wishes of His Majesty\nKing Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the\nGovernment and, indeed, the entire Swazi nation.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland congratulates you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of this session.\nWe are especially proud that a fellow African has been\nelected to that demanding position, and we are\nconfident that your diplomatic skill and experience will\nhelp you to lead the Assembly towards a successful\nconclusion of its deliberations.\nIn the aftermath of 11 September 2001, the world\nis understandably preoccupied with the question of\nsecurity and the war on terror. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland continues to condemn, in no uncertain\nterms, terrorism which constantly threatens world\npeace, security and stability. As part of our support for\nthe alliance against terrorism, the Government of\nSwaziland is currently studying the United Nations\nconventions that deal with terrorism, to ensure not only\nthe adaptation of such important conventions, but also\ncompliance with them. The Parliament of the Kingdom\nof Swaziland will be debating, and will hopefully pass,\nits long-awaited anti-terrorism bill during its next\nsession.\nFuture world stability is also threatened by the\ncontinuing spread of weapons of mass destruction. Our\nfailure as an Organization in that regard thus far is due\nto inability to agree on a time frame suitable to all\nMembers for arms control and nuclear disarmament.\nThe Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) were designed as an essential first\nstep towards a world free from the danger that such\nweapons pose. We clearly need to find a way to\nstrengthen the non-proliferation regime and to prevent\nthe flow of conventional weapons and anti-personnel\nlandmines into zones of conflicts or into the hands of\nterrorists. The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore calls\nupon the Conference on Disarmament to implement the\nproposal of the Non-Aligned Movement by\nestablishing, as its highest priority, an ad hoc\ncommittee to begin negotiations on a programme for\nthe complete and time-bound elimination of nuclear\nweapons from those countries that have them.\nWhile the possibility of global conflict has\ndiminished since the end of the cold war era, it is a fact\nthat there has been a corresponding increase in the\nincidence of internal conflicts and cross-border\ndisturbances, arising from a variety of causes,\nincluding ethnic and religious confrontation.\nThe situation in the Middle East is inevitably at\nthe centre of the debate on peace and security. The\nKingdom of Swaziland pledges the continuation of our\nsupport for all initiatives and efforts aimed at resolving\nthat situation and at bringing peace and stability to the\nMiddle East. We sincerely believe that the vital role of\nthe United Nations continues to be critical to the\nresolution of the Middle East conflict.\nThe creation of the African Union and the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), and\nthe great strides that have been taken in the past two\nyears, are a clear indication that we are moving in the\nright direction. We are convinced that, with the support\nof the international community and in the spirit of the\ntrue partnership that is demonstrated by mutual respect,\nwe shall succeed in our objectives, initiatives and\nefforts to raise the living standards of our peoples.\nWe have placed our trust in NEPAD to be the\nvehicle for that shift away from the underdevelopment\nand conflict of the past by addressing the fundamental\nroot causes of our problems. The ongoing integration\nof our initiatives and programmes within the African\ncontinent will make possible sustainability and true\ngrowth in our economies. Together, in unity of\npurpose, we shall succeed. In that regard, we welcome\nthe establishment by the Secretary-General of the\nAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD,\nwhich will, in our view, help us to be more effective in\nour efforts to promote Africa\u2019s development.\nOur united effort is also addressing the conflicts\nthat continue to threaten peace, stability and security\non the African continent. We realize that, without those\nelements, our development goals will continue to elude\nus, especially because, apart from resources that are\nwasted on arms, our people can be productive and be\nable to trade among themselves and with the rest of the\n22\n\nworld only under conditions of peace, stability and\nsecurity.\nThe establishment of the Peace and Security\nCouncil of the African Union is a landmark event in\nour efforts to manage our conflicts. In particular, allow\nme to single out for commendation Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for his tireless efforts to highlight and\naddress African problems. We look forward to the\ncomplete resolution of the dispute in Somalia, and in\nparticular to the resolution of the dispute in the Darfur\nregion of the Sudan.\nThe complex challenges facing the world today\nlend greater significance and urgency to initiatives for\nthe reform of our Organization. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland believes that those reforms are essential if\nthe United Nations is to retain the global credibility\nand authority that are so necessary to its operations.\nOur aim must be to transform the Organization into a\nstructure that is truly representative of all Members and\nthat is transparent and efficient in its operations, while\nremaining consistent with the purposes and objectives\nof our founding Charter. We believe that achieving\nbalanced representation in the principal organs of the\nUnited Nations should be a priority.\nIn that regard, we support an increase in both\npermanent and non-permanent seats in the Security\nCouncil. The Security Council in particular requires\nreform in order to strengthen its legitimacy. Its\ncomposition must reflect the plurality and diversity of\nthe membership of the United Nations, to recognize the\nprofound geopolitical changes that have taken place in\nrecent history. However, due to a lack of political will\non the part of some Members to increase the\nmembership of the Security Council, progress in the\nreform agenda remains unattainable.\nTurning now to the question of development, we\nbelieve that the Millennium Declaration marked a\nturning point in carrying out the mission unanimously\nentrusted to the United Nations in the area of\nsustainable development. Indeed, for the first time,\nheads of State or Government agreed on specific goals\nand targets in the social, economic and educational\nfields, up to the year 2015. In our view, the leaders\nwere correct to make the related topics of peace,\nsecurity, development and poverty eradication\npriorities to be addressed, because future world\nstability depends on the ability of national\nGovernments to increase the momentum for economic\ndevelopment and their capacity to improve the delivery\nof job creation and essential services such as health\nand education.\nDeveloping countries have been facing special\ndifficulties in responding to the challenges brought\nabout by globalization. As a result, many developing\ncountries, especially the least developed ones, have\nremained marginalized in the globalizing world\neconomy. Consequently, the benefits of globalization\nare unevenly distributed. In that regard, the Kingdom\nof Swaziland believes that in order to maximize the\nbenefits of globalization, the process of integration into\nthe world economy should take into account the level\nof economic development of each country and the\ncapacity of its institutions and enterprises. In\nparticular, specific national development potentials and\nsocio-economic circumstances, as well as differing\ninitial conditions relating to size, resource\nendowments, economic structure and location, should\nbe considered. It is also necessary to take into account\nthe specific development, financial and trade needs of\ndeveloping countries, in view of the fact that there can\nbe no one-size-fits-all trade development strategy.\nI believe that I speak on behalf of many from the\ndeveloping world when I say that small economies are\nnot receiving fair treatment in global trade. The\nproposed removal of preferential terms for our\nagricultural products and the continuation of subsidies\nfor such products from the developed world is bound to\ndeal a fatal blow to many of our weak economies. We\nrequest understanding and appreciation of our situation\nby our developed partners. We are asking for a\npartnership that will take into account our unique\nsituations as developing economies so that we can\nparticipate effectively in the global market. For our\npart, as small economies, we pledge quality and high\nstandards for our products. Our farmers are more than\nready to deliver the best to international markets. It\nshould be noted that agricultural incomes are the\ncornerstone of development for our rural communities.\nFor our part in the Kingdom of Swaziland,\npoverty alleviation remains the number-one priority.\nSixty-six per cent of our people are living below the\ninternationally recognized poverty line, yet our\nclassification as a lower-middle-income country\nprevents our access to many of the funds and resources\nthat are available to those in different categories. We\nwill be working with the United Nations to ensure that\nthis situation is corrected.\n23\n\nIn the meantime, we are focusing our efforts and\navailable resources on programmes that meet the\nchallenges of poverty in a sustainable and equitable\nmanner. Our national development strategy, which is\nthe result of direct consultation with all stakeholders,\nhas incorporated all eight priority United Nations\nMillennium Development Goals so as to provide us\nwith a blueprint for government action towards\nachieving the vision of improving the livelihood of our\npeople by 2022.\nDespite all our best efforts and our limited\nsuccess in many areas, we are restricted in our capacity\nto meet our objectives due to a multitude of problems\nthat are affecting us simultaneously and that we cannot\novercome on our own. As is the case with all\ndeveloping countries, we are particularly at risk in\ntimes of global economic difficulties and are\nparticularly vulnerable to disease and to the effects of\nchanging weather patterns.\nWeakening our efforts to meet our development\nchallenges is the threat posed by multiple health\nhazards, including malaria and tuberculosis, but\nespecially HIV/AIDS. AIDS continues to claim the\nlives of many of our people. No sector of development\nhas been spared the ravaging impact of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, with enormous strain placed on our financial\nand human resources as we make the required\ninterventions. We are attacking the enemy on various\nfronts, with priority on prevention, care, counselling\nand treatment. Our National Emergency Response\nCommittee has had some success with regard to home-\nbased and community-based care for those already ill\nas a result of infection.\nUnfortunately, we are currently experiencing an\nexodus of qualified nurses, who are being employed in\nthe developed world. The exodus has adversely\naffected our capacity-building efforts. That exodus,\ntogether with other wider impacts of HIV/AIDS, has\ndealt our economy a heavy blow.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to make the\nwelfare of children a priority in our development strategy.\nIn that regard, both the Government and the private\nsector, including non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs), have responded with zeal and determination\nto the plight of orphans and other vulnerable children,\nresulting from the effects of the pandemic. The\nGovernment is providing bursaries for such children in\norder to ensure that their education is not disrupted.\nThe Government and the business community, in\npartnership with NGOs, are providing school feeding\nschemes in order to improve their nutritional balance.\nWe are also using our traditional structures to cater for\ntheir material and emotional needs; this includes the\nprovision of local reporting structures to prevent the\nabuse of those children. The chiefdoms also provide\nfields where communities grow food for orphans and\nother vulnerable children.\nLet me take this opportunity to express the most\nprofound gratitude of the entire Swazi nation to the\nUnited Nations and to all our development partners for\nthe support we continue to receive as we face that\nkiller disease. The support we have received from the\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\ncontinues to prop up and sustain our programmes and\nstrategies in our fight against this scourge. Fellow\nmembers, we shall be forever grateful to you all.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is fully committed to\nthe principles of good governance and the rule of law.\nThe nation has just completed debating the Kingdom\u2019s\ndraft constitution, and the draft will soon be submitted\nto Parliament for final consideration before the end of\nthis year.\nFor more than 30 years, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland has been enjoying excellent relations with a\nnation which, despite an outstanding record in\ninternational development assistance and despite\nfulfilling every requirement for membership in the\nOrganization, is nonetheless excluded from\nparticipation in the activities of the United Nations. I\nam referring here to the issue of the 23 million people\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan, who are denied\nthe right to contribute to the global initiatives\nundertaken by this world body. The Government and\nthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have\nmade enormous advances in economic, social and\npolitical terms, and they have shown themselves ready\nand able to share their experience and advice with all\nthe nations of the world. The Kingdom of Swaziland,\ntherefore, proposes to the Assembly that the time has\ncome to revisit this issue so as to ensure the inclusion\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of\nthe United Nations and its associated agencies.\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\nopportunity to express the deep gratitude of His\nMajesty the King, the Indlovukazi, the Government\nand the people of Swaziland to the United Nations and\n24\n\nits agencies for the many programmes of assistance\nundertaken in the Kingdom of Swaziland since our\nindependence.\nWe believe that the United Nations, as the only\ntruly global Organization, remains the only hope for\novercoming the many complex challenges facing the\nworld today. Despite the setbacks, and despite the\nobstacles to achieving our collective aims, there can be\nno doubt that the world could be a more troubled place\nwithout the combined efforts of all of us. The Kingdom\nof Swaziland, therefore, takes great pride in\nreaffirming our commitment to the principles and\nideals set out in the Charter, and we ask Almighty God\nto watch over and guide us in the challenging times\nahead for our Organization."

        "file_text": "It gives me great\npleasure to congratulate you, Sir, as you ably and\nwisely guide our deliberations at the fifty-ninth\nsession. Allow me also to take this opportunity to\nexpress my delegation\u2019s appreciation to Mr. Julian\nHunte of Saint Lucia for his successful stewardship of\nthe work of the fifty-eighth session.\nThe world has changed a great deal since our\nhopes and aspirations were enshrined in the Charter\nalmost 60 years ago. What has not changed, but\nremains unaltered, is our collective desire to build a\nsafe, tolerant and secure world, anchored in justice and\nsocial progress.\nWhat has not changed is the very spirit and\ndriving force that brought us together \u2014 we, the\npeoples of the United Nations. Those opening words of\nthe Charter remind us that the United Nations is a\ncreation of the peoples of the world. Those words\ncompel us to recall that our Organization has been\nentrusted by our peoples with the sacred task of\ntranslating their aspirations into reality. They are words\nthat tell us that we are assembled today not only as\ndelegates of our Governments, but also as\nrepresentatives of our peoples. With those words, the\nCharter freed the world from the notion that only States\nmatter. With those words, the people were placed at the\nheart of our United Nations.\nToday, the technologies and discoveries that make\nthe world smaller and should bring us together are\nbeing used to tear us apart. Today, new forms of\npolitical, economic and social division directly threaten\nour people and the values and dreams they hold dear.\nThese threats have the potential to overwhelm the\ngains of our Organization and to divide our peoples.\nAll these factors have given rise to clamour for\ndecisive reform in the United Nations. We should start\nwith the basic reform of the structures and\nrelationships that define powers and responsibilities.\nFor our Organization, this means pursuing earnest\nreforms in the Security Council; the General Assembly\nand its subsidiary bodies; and the Secretariat. But\naddressing the most basic elements is also the most\ndifficult thing to do.\nAny planned reform of the United Nations should\nbe endorsed by consensus by all 191 Member States.\nAny reform of the Security Council should give due\nconsideration to the views of the five permanent\nmembers, as they will have the final say in the matter.\n15\n\nAny reform should also recognize that a country like\nJapan deserves to be considered for a seat as a\npermanent member.\nWe must all put our creative energies to work,\nspare no effort and ignore no avenue or opportunity in\nbringing greater peace and progress to our peoples.\nReligion and religious leaders have a role to play in\nfostering tolerance and greater understanding among\npeoples. They bring unique perspectives to the\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nInter-faith dialogue between the peoples of\ndifferent civilizations should also be encouraged. Deep\nand historic divisions can be healed through a dialogue\nbetween peoples of different faiths and civilizations.\nThe Philippines will work with like-minded\ndelegations in support of efforts to broaden such a\ndialogue.\nOur peoples\u2019 differences, whether of belief or of\nculture, should not be a basis for misunderstanding or\nconflict. But most of all, reform must begin by placing\nthe welfare and interests of the peoples of the world at\nthe forefront our deliberations.\nIn the 15 minutes that it will take me to deliver\nmy remarks, 60 people will have died of tuberculosis.\nBy the time the curtain falls on a Broadway show, 250\npersons, mostly women and children, will have been\ntrafficked into forced servitude or prostitution. By the\ntime we wake up tomorrow morning, 3,000 children\nwill have died of malaria and a further 6,000 children\nwill have perished for lack of clean water.\nInstead of having school books in their hands,\nover 300,000 children in conflict areas have their\nfingers on the triggers of automatic rifles.\nHIV/AIDS kills 3 million people a year; millions\nof refugees crowd camps. One fifth of the world\u2019s\npopulation still live in abject poverty, barely subsisting\non less than the price of the newspaper sold around the\ncorner from our hotels.\nTerrorism, the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction and the massive proliferation of small arms\ndirectly threaten the people and their livelihood and\nrepresent an assault on their dignity.\nCritical flashpoints, most of which are in my part\nof the world, have the potential for armed conflict that\nwould certainly place people and their futures at grave\nrisk.\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations and\nas a current member of the Security Council, the\nPhilippines places its faith in the Organization for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\npromotion of social progress and better standards of\nlife and the protection of the fundamental rights of\nindividuals.\nPeople antedate the evolution of statehood. As we\nplace people at the centre of the United Nations, I\nwould like to highlight the need to protect their lives\nand the importance of ensuring their livelihood and\npromoting their dignity.\nWe must allow our peoples to live free from fear,\nto live in a safe and secure world. Terrorism poses a\nserious threat not only to the lives of our people, but\nalso to the values and ideals that define our societies.\nTerrorism reduces people to mere pawns in a ruthless\ngame of competing beliefs and ideologies.\nThe rubble in Jakarta has been cleared. Flowers\ncover the little graves in Beslan. But the enemies of all\npeoples are still lurking in the shadows, conspiring and\nplotting, with evil in their hearts and the blood of\ninnocents on their hands.\nThe Philippines condemns all forms of terrorism.\nNo cause or dogma can ever justify its use. Long\nbefore 11 September 2001, the Philippines and its\npeople suffered from the scourge of terrorism. We have\nseen the face of terror and felt its deadly touch. We\nwere among the first in our region to join the\ninternational war against terror. The Philippines\nbelieves that conflicts should be addressed before\nterrorism can begin to define or exploit them. This can\nbe done by working together with other nations.\nPresident Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo believes that\na new kind of peace has to be developed for a new kind\nof war, waged by terrorists. She proposes a new global\nalliance to alleviate poverty and remove it as a\nbreeding ground for resentment and conflict.\nWith the help of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, violent secessionism has given way to\npeaceful autonomy in southern Philippines. The\npotential for terrorism to breed has been drastically\nreduced. In partnership with Malaysia, we are closer to\na negotiated peace with the remaining secessionists,\nwho themselves have renounced terror. With Norway\nas a facilitator, prospects remain for peace talks with\n16\n\none of the world\u2019s few remaining communist rebel\ngroups.\nAnother important dimension of human security\nis economic. At the national level, economic security\nmeans primarily providing livelihood for the people. In\nthe Philippines, President Arroyo has enshrined that\ngoal in her 10-point programme of action for 2004 to\n2010. The programme calls for the creation of\n6 million jobs in six years by giving more opportunities\nto entrepreneurs, tripling the amount of loans to small\nand medium-size enterprises and developing 1 million\nto 2 million hectares of land for agribusiness.\nIf we are to maintain economic security, the\ninternational community should also make job creation\na priority goal in international economic cooperation.\nThe General Assembly should look more closely at\ninnovative tools that will help spur economic growth,\nparticularly in developing countries. Greater attention\nshould be focused on how micro-credit or\nmicrofinance \u2014 an area where the Philippines has\nmade significant strides \u2014 could serve as an\ninstrument to alleviate the conditions of the poorest of\nthe poor.\nCreative ways to solve the lingering debt issue\nand the spiralling cost of energy should also be\nconsidered. We need to ease the burden of debt\nservicing and to channel those meagre resources to\nwhere they are needed most. Each day, developing\ncountries pay the rich nations $717 million in debt\nservice. Every baby born in the developing world\nalready owes $482 at birth. Every year, sub-Saharan\nAfrica pays $10 billion in debt service \u2014 four times as\nmuch money as the countries in the region spend on\nhealth care and education. The wise mobilization of\ndomestic resources, such as remittances for\ndevelopment, should also be carefully studied.\nRemittances by migrants \u2014 much greater than the total\namount of overseas development assistance \u2014\nalleviate the poverty of the family members remaining\nin their country of origin.\nEconomic security prospers when the playing\nfield is level for both developed and developing\ncountries. Levelling the economic playing field ensures\nthat the fruits of globalization will benefit the people in\nterms of better opportunities, more jobs and improved\nlivelihood. International trade, investment and\ndevelopment are crucial tools in raising the people\u2019s\nstandard of living. But the people of poor countries\ncontinue to face persistent barriers to their products\nfrom the developing world. Those barriers exist despite\nthe strictures of the international trading system,\nemphasizing the need for an open, rule-based\nmultilateral trading system.\nEconomic crises in developing countries result in\nimmediate threats to human security. When people do\nnot know where their next meal will come from or\nwhen their crops will fail, human security is\ncompromised. In an interlinked global economy, crises\nspread rapidly. The prevention and mitigation of such\ncrises in developing countries also enhances human\nsecurity in developed countries. A World Bank study\nshows, for instance, that the total elimination of\nagricultural subsidies in rich countries would increase\nrural income in low- and medium-income countries by\nabout $60 billion a year.\nNeedless to say, international trade policy needs\nto be fair, not only to farmers of the developed world,\nbut also to their counterparts in the developing\ncountries. As a start, a substantial reduction in\nagricultural subsidies for farmers in rich countries\nwould go a long way towards helping their fellow\nagricultural workers beyond their borders. There is also\na need for developed countries to implement their\ncommitments to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross\nnational product for official development assistance.\nAgain, official development assistance is an instrument\nto help people help themselves \u2014 a social\nresponsibility that is more pronounced now, in an era\nof increasing globalization. The inexorable pace of\nglobalization fuels new phenomena and creates new\nchallenges to human security. The fluidity of capital,\ntechnology, culture and even people should be\nacknowledged as inherent to globalization and should\nbe harnessed for the good of the people.\nDemocracy and freedom \u2014 central elements to\nensuring the rights and dignity of the people \u2014 should\nbe encouraged and promoted, particularly in countries\nthat are in transition or recovering from conflict. It is\nin that spirit that the Philippines supports the call for\nthe establishment of a democracy fund. The Philippines\nis prepared to provide technical support and training in\nthe areas of governance, the administration of justice,\nelectoral processes and similar subjects, with\nthird-party support. We will share our knowledge \u2014 a\nresult of our own experience as Asia\u2019s first\ndemocracy \u2014 since we have had to struggle to regain\nand preserve that very same democracy.\n17\n\nThe world should continue to support the people\nof Iraq in their valiant effort to create a democratic,\nfree, pluralistic and secure nation. The Philippines\nstands ready to assist in implementing Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) on Iraq, which was\nunanimously adopted during our presidency of the\nCouncil last June. The United Nations has a significant\nrole to play in Iraq in the political process leading to\nthe elections scheduled for January next year, and it\ndeserves the full support of the international\ncommunity in its efforts to build a stable and peaceful\nIraq.\nConflict has devastating effects on the safety and\nsecurity of people. The deliberate targeting of innocent\ncivilians as victims is increasingly being used as a\nweapon of war and as a tool of terrorists. The\nmovement of people across borders reinforces the\ninterdependence of countries, facilitates the transfer of\nskills and knowledge and stimulates economic growth\nand development. In order to protect the security of\nmigrants, we must give them the legal status that will\nenable them to gain access to basic services and will\nensure the protection of fundamental rights. The\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\nFamilies entered into force on 1 July 2003. We take\nthis opportunity to call on all our friends to make every\neffort to accede to the Convention.\nThe interdependence and interlinkages among the\npeoples of the world require that human security\nshould top the agendas of local, national, regional and\nglobal governance. Human security addresses the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, responds to our\npeoples\u2019 aspirations as enshrined in our Charter and\nreinvigorates the United Nations in the process.\nFinally, in a world where people are sometimes\nreduced to images on a screen and their suffering\ndistilled into pixels and fonts, perhaps we should again\nbe reminded that, when we gave life to the United\nNations almost 60 years ago, we ushered in a new era\nin the human saga, embarking on our historic journey\nwith the words: \u201cWe the peoples of the United\nNations ...\u201d."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea, I should like at the outset to congratulate you,\nMr. Ping, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. I believe that your\nskilful leadership of this session will yield fruitful\nresults. I also appreciate the active efforts of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to ensure the\ncentral role of the United Nations in addressing major\ninternational issues.\nFour years have passed since we marked the\nbeginning of the new century. However, humankind is\nstill confronted with grave challenges in its efforts to\nrealize the aspirations of peoples to build a peaceful\nand prosperous world.\nUnilateralism and high-handedness are becoming\nincreasingly evident, giving rise to aggression,\narbitrariness and instability in many parts of the world.\nConsequently, the vicious circle in which the\nsovereignty and interests of weak and small countries\nare trampled for the sake of the exclusive interests of\ncertain other countries continues unabated.\nToday, the main factors undermining international\npeace and stability are unilateralism and high-handed\nacts based on the logic of power. The challenges facing\nhumankind today require, more urgently than ever,\nUnited Nations Member States to strengthen their joint\nefforts to seek to ensure equitable international\nrelations based on multilateralism that fully observe\nthe universal principles of respect for sovereignty,\nequality, territorial integrity and mutual benefit.\nOne of the regions where unilateralism and high-\nhandedness are most rampant is North-East Asia \u2014 to\nbe more specific, the Korean peninsula. On the Korean\npeninsula, the national division forcibly brought about\nby outside forces has continued for more than half a\ncentury, and the danger of war is snowballing, owing to\nextreme attempts by the United States to isolate and\nstifle the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and\nto threats of pre-emptive strikes against it.\nAt this very moment, all kinds of sophisticated\nwar equipment are being deployed in and around the\n28\n\nKorean peninsula, targeting the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea.\nThe acute political and military situation\nprevailing in and around the Korean peninsula proves\nclearly once again how right it was of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to have built up its strong\nself-defensive military power to prevent war and\nensure peace, upholding the Songun policy of the\nrespected General Kim Jong Il.\nThe more vicious the attempts of outside forces\nto isolate and stifle the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea, the higher our army and people, firmly\nunited around their leader, hold up the banner of\nSongun and push ahead with their struggle to build a\nprosperous and powerful State, with hope for the future\nand devotion to the socialist cause.\nThe Songun policy \u2014 the independent policy of\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \u2014 serves\nas a reliable deterrent to ensure peace and security, not\nonly on the Korean peninsula, but also in North-East\nAsia and the rest of the world. We feel great pride and\nself-confidence in that respect.\nThe reunification of the country is a prerequisite\nfor achieving a durable peace on the Korean peninsula,\nand we are steadfast in our determination to achieve\nnational reunification, independently, on the basis of\nthe North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June.\nThat Joint Declaration is one of national\nindependence, as well as a milestone of reunification\nindicating the path towards national reconciliation,\ncollaboration and reunification.\nVarious actions aimed at national co-prosperity\nwere begun in accordance with the lofty spirit of the\nJoint Declaration. The connecting of railways and\nroads has proceeded, linking up the once-severed main\nartery of the country; contacts and mutual travel at all\nlevels increased; and inter-Korean economic\ncooperation has been guaranteed at the institutional\nlevel.\nIt is regrettable, however, that that tortuous\nprocess of reconciliation and cooperation between the\nnorth and the south of Korea was not sustained until\ndurable peace and reunification could be achieved.\nThat is because the process is unwelcome to the United\nStates, which is therefore dead-set against improved\nrelations and the ongoing cooperative activities, which\nare taking place at all levels between the north and the\nsouth of Korea.\nThe United States should no longer hamper the\nefforts of the north and the south of Korea to achieve\nnational reconciliation, collaboration and reunification.\nNo matter how the situation may change in the\nfuture, the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea will continue to strive to overcome\nall the challenges of the anti-reunification forces within\nand without, and to open up a broad path leading to the\nindependent reunification of the country through\nnational cooperation, based on the great proposition,\n\u201cBy our nation itself\u201d.\nI would like to take this opportunity to clarify\nonce again the principled stand of our Government\nregarding the nuclear issue between the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States.\nAs I have made clear time and again from this\nrostrum, the nuclear issue is the product of the deep-\nrooted hostile policy towards the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea pursued by the United States for\nmore than half a century. In other words, given the fact\nthat the current United States Administration, which is\naccustomed to rejecting our system, has been\nattempting to eliminate the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea by force, while designating it part of\nan \u201caxis of evil\u201d and a target for pre-emptive nuclear\nstrikes, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has\nbeen left with no other option than to possess a nuclear\ndeterrent.\nPeace is very precious to our people, who have\nbeen living for more than half a century with the\nheartbreaking pain of national division, forcibly\nbrought about by outside forces, and under constant\nthreat from the world\u2019s only super-Power.\nOur people aspire to peace more than others, but\nthey never beg for peace. The peace that they want to\nachieve is the peace of an independent life, not the\npeace of slaves, deprived of freedom.\nThe confrontation on the Korean peninsula today\nis, in essence, a confrontation between foreign forces\nintruding into someone\u2019s home and the owners of that\nhome struggling to defend it.\nThe nuclear deterrent capability of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea constitutes a\nlegitimate means of self-defence to counter the ever-\n29\n\ngrowing nuclear threat of the United States and its\naggression against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea, as well as a reliable means to defend the\nsovereignty, peace and security of the country.\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is\nour goal, and it is the consistent position of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to address\npeacefully the nuclear issue between our country and\nthe United States through dialogue and negotiation.\nIf the United States were to renounce practically\nits hostile policy towards the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea, including the cessation of its\nnuclear threats, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea would, accordingly, be willing to scrap its\nnuclear deterrent.\nOn the basis of that position, the Government of\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea proposed a\npackage solution underpinned by the word-for-word\nand action-for-action principle aimed at achieving a\npeaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. As the first\nstep towards that end, we offered the flexible \u201creward\nfor freeze\u201d proposal.\nIn this regard, at the third round of the six-party\ntalks last June, the countries concerned shared the view\nthat it was important that both sides adhere to the\nword-for-word and action-for-action principle and the\n\u201ccorresponding measures for freeze\u201d approach, and\nreached an agreement.\nThe \u201creward for freeze\u201d proposal provides for the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to freeze all\nnuclear-weapon-related facilities and the output from\ntheir operations, on the condition that the United States\nabandon its hostile policy, in particular its demands\nrelating to the complete, verifiable and irreversible\ndismantlement of our nuclear programme and, at the\nsame time, that it lift its economic sanctions and\nblockade against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea, remove the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea from its list of the sponsors of terrorism and\nparticipate in an energy compensation scheme\ninvolving two million kilowatts of capacity.\nBy offering this proposal, it is our intention, first,\nto build mutual confidence, and, eventually, to resolve\nthe nuclear issue fundamentally by addressing each\nother\u2019s concerns and meeting respective demands step\nby step, on the basis of simultaneous actions, given\nthat the current situation is characterized by hostile\nrelations between the two countries and extreme\ndistrust.\nThe proposed \u201creward for freeze\u201d process would\nbe a confidence-building measure between the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates. Such confidence will be possible only when the\nUnited States rewards us for imposing a freeze.\nIt is only natural that everything should have a\nbeginning and an order. From that point of view, our\nfreeze will be the first step towards the eventual\ndismantling of our nuclear programme. Of course, the\nfreeze will be followed by objective verification.\nIn order to further clarify our will to dismantle\nthe nuclear deterrent, we had intended to include in our\nfreeze a halt to the manufacture, testing and transfer of\nnuclear weapons. The United States, however,\ndisregarding the common understanding and agreement\nreached at the third round of six-party talks, has further\nintensified its hostile and increasingly overt acts\nagainst the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea,\neven openly announcing that there would be no reward\nfor the freezing and dismantling of our nuclear\nfacilities. Most recently, the United States adopted a\nbill on human rights in North Korea and thus made it\nlegal to provide financial and material support for\noverthrowing our system and to force third countries to\ndo so.\nThe United States has gone so far as to slander\nand debase the supreme leadership of its dialogue\npartner. It also forces us to disarm ourselves like a\ndefeated nation, thus attempting to forcibly dismantle\nour nuclear programme first and to overthrow our\nsystem through complete, verifiable, irreversible\ndismantlement. Consequently, the basis of negotiations,\nwhich were hardly moving towards a resolution of the\nnuclear issue, has been completely destroyed. If the\nUnited States wishes to coexist peacefully with the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea by abandoning\nits hostile policy, the nuclear issue will be resolved\nproperly.\nWith regard to the six-party talks, the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea is willing to resume them.\nNevertheless, the increasingly hostile policy of the\nUnited States and the clandestine nuclear-related\nexperiments recently revealed in South Korea are\nmajor stumbling blocks to the continuation of the talks.\nGiven this serious situation, in which the basis of the\nnegotiations has been totally destroyed and the secret\n30\n\nnuclear-related experiments in South Korea have not\nyet been clarified, we are unable to participate in the\ntalks aimed at discussing the nuclear-weapons\nprogramme. Therefore, if the six-party talks are to be\nresumed, the basis for the talks demolished by the\nUnited States should be properly restored and the truth\nof the secret nuclear experiments in South Korea\nclarified completely.\nI take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to\nthe States Members of the United Nations for their\nactive support for and understanding of our principled\nstand and hope that they will continue to contribute to\nthe peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States by maintaining their balanced approach.\nIf the United Nations is to fulfil its mission for\ninternational peace and security and socio-economic\ndevelopment, it should play a leading role in\naddressing the major international issues in accordance\nwith the objectives and principles of its Charter. To that\nend, the United Nations should no longer tolerate\nunilateralism and high-handedness, which constitute a\nserious violation of the Charter and existing\ninternational law. Disputes should be resolved\npeacefully through dialogue and negotiations, and there\nis no justification whatsoever for the unilateral use of\nforce, such as the armed invasion of sovereign States.\nMoreover, the Organization should be\ndemocratized so that all international issues can be\nresolved in the common interests of the Member States.\nIn that regard, our delegation is of the view that the\nGeneral Assembly should be empowered to review and\napprove the resolutions of the Security Council relating\nto sanctions and the use of force directly affecting\ninternational peace and security.\nThe reform of the Security Council should be\nundertaken in such a way as to enable it to ensure the\nfull representation and interests of the non-aligned and\nother developing countries, which account for the\noverwhelming majority of Member States and\ncontribute to a fair solution to disputes. In addition,\npractical measures should be taken to actively assist\nthe developing countries in their efforts to achieve\nsustainable development by strengthening the role of\nthe United Nations and its affiliated organs in the\nsocio-economic fields.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea will in the future continue to regard\nindependence, peace and friendship as the main ideals\nof its foreign policy and further strengthen its friendly\nand cooperative relations with all States Members of\nthe United Nations that respect our sovereignty and\nactively contribute to international efforts to establish a\njust, equitable and new world order."

        "file_text": "The agenda of this\nsession not only is full of importance and burning\nissues but also brings great hopes and expectations. In\nhis statement, Mr. Bernard Bot, the Foreign Minister of\nthe Netherlands, presented the European Union\u2019s\nposition on the most important problems. That\nstatement fully reflects our thinking and concerns. One\nissue, however, that deserves our special attention\ntoday is the reform of the United Nations.\nThe present session of the General Assembly\nmust be remembered as a session of reform. It should\nlay the foundations for a profound and\nconsensus-based reflection on the relevance and the\neffectiveness of the United Nations. This reflection\nshould result in bold and imaginative decisions\nproviding for a substantial overhaul of the\nOrganization. That is how we in Poland see the\npreparations for the major event of 2005, which will\nundertake a comprehensive review of the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration Goals\nand mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted, the\nUnited Nations is at a fork in the road. It is time to act.\nEvery year, at the annual general debate of the\nGeneral Assembly, we take the floor to express our\nviews \u2014 sometimes very critical \u2014 on the work of the\nOrganization. However, there is little evidence that\nthese debates have had any significant impact on the\nfuture of the United Nations. Indeed, over the past\nyears, the United Nations has seen many celebratory\nand majestic gatherings. Unless we are able to build a\npolitical consensus and work out efficient,\nforward-looking and workable decisions, we should cut\ndown on high-level ceremonies.\n46\n\nPoland has frequently voiced its conviction that\nwe have to carry out a comprehensive, strategic review\nof the role of the United Nations in both its normative\nand institutional aspects. It was with this in mind that,\non behalf of my country two years ago, I had the\nprivilege of putting forward the idea of a new political\nact for the United Nations. We are pleased to see that,\ntwo years later, that belief and determination are\nwidely shared.\nBearing in mind the unique momentum for\nreform, we look forward to the recommendations of the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\nThey should provide the critical mass for the reform\nefforts and form a solid basis for further actions.\nIn that context, I express my gratitude to the\nmembers of the Panel, who came to Warsaw in May\nthis year to consult with representatives of our part of\nEurope on the most important conceptual aspects of the\nreform. The Warsaw Regional Conference was a\nrewarding experience. The report issued following the\nconference has been made available to all delegations\nat the Assembly.\nWe have never had any problem with ideas,\nexcellent proposals and promising initiatives. The\nbiggest obstacle to reform, rather, has been the lack of\npolitical consensus. The reform cannot be effective if it\nreflects the ideas of small groups of specialists or\npoliticians alone. It must rely on a broad consensus and\nreflect a shared community of values and a sense of\nidentity and purpose. Building that consensus is our\nmajor, common task.\nThe reform of the United Nations has to go\nbeyond institutional aspects, but we recognize the fact\nthat institutions are important. Therefore, any reform\npackage lacking ideas for reforming the organs of the\nUnited Nations would be considered inadequate by the\nmajority of Member States.\nPoland shares the common opinion that it is hard\nto imagine strengthening the role of the Security\nCouncil without increasing its legitimacy. Today\u2019s\ndiscussions on Council reform are focused mainly on\nexpanding its membership. However, the key to a more\neffective and legitimate Security Council does not lie\nin the number of its members. A Council of\n24 members would probably have no more powerful a\nvoice than a Council of 15. However, at the present\nstage of discussions, we agree that the Security Council\nhas to be expanded.\nOne of the deficiencies of the United Nations, as\nit transpires from the conceptual discussions, is that\nthere is too great a gap between the functions of\nmandating and implementing. Therefore, we believe\nthat it is the responsibility of the members of the\nSecurity Council to take the lead in providing political\nand material support for implementation of Security\nCouncil mandates. Security Council reform should be\nbased on the assumption that membership on the\nCouncil not only confers additional privileges but also\nbrings additional responsibilities.\nThe reform should preserve the inherent balance\namong the various organs of the United Nations. While\nwe support the tendency to expect more from the\nSecurity Council, any reform should be accompanied\nby a more effective role for the General Assembly. The\ntwo bodies should be seen as mutually supportive and\nreinforcing organs.\nHowever, in order to use the potential of the\nGeneral Assembly effectively and optimize its\nperformance, we must profoundly change the way we\nspeak to one another in this forum. This must be a\nforum of dialogue. Occasionally, one hears jokes along\nthe lines that the General Assembly is a place where\neverybody speaks but nobody listens. We have to\nchange that. We must start talking to one another more\ndirectly, more candidly. Let me assure the President, as\nwe congratulate him on the assumption of his post, that\nPoland will support all his efforts in that regard.\nWe need to enhance the performance of the\nbodies of the United Nations in social and economic\ndevelopment and the environment, as well as in other,\nrelated, no less pressing areas. There is a real danger\nthat the Millennium Development Goals will not be\nfulfilled. That would deliver a serious blow to the\ncredibility of the United Nations. Given that the\ndistinction between socio-economic and political issues\nis becoming increasingly blurred, we need a unified\napproach.\nHowever, the existing efforts are often too\nfragmented, uncoordinated, and even contradictory and\nself-paralytic. In this context, the role of the Economic\nand Social Council and its reform should be strictly\nlinked with other United Nations bodies.\nIn order to be comprehensive, the reform cannot\nstop at its institutional dimension. We need to revisit\nthe nature of current security challenges that expose\nthe deficiencies and shortcomings of our Organization\n47\n\nin the most systematic way. Predictable threats caused\nin the past by wars between countries have been\nreplaced by indefinite and unpredictable threats caused\nby international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction (WMDs), and an increasing\nnumber of States in distress, whose Governments are\nunable to exercise effective power over their territory\nand population. As a consequence, we are facing an\nunprecedented spread of terrorist acts and violence.\nIn this context, on behalf of the people of Poland\nand myself, I express our deepest condolences to the\nrelatives of the victims of the recent events in Beslan.\nWe condemn this barbaric act and offer our solidarity\nwith the victims.\nTo cope properly and successfully with the new\nnature of threats and challenges, it is necessary to use\nthis opportunity to examine the functional and\nconceptual basis of the Organization. Therefore,\nPoland advocates that the important part of the reform\nshould be re-examination of the conceptual foundations\nof the United Nations.\nIn today\u2019s world, new threats cast a new light on\nthe concepts that we use to regulate the international\norder. Principles such as non-use of force, sovereignty,\nlegitimacy, accountability for both States and their\nleaders, subsidiarity, complementarity, solidarity and\nresponsibility still occupy the highest level of\nimportance. What we need is their adjustment to the\ncurrent reality, new political guidelines on how we, and\nhow Security Council members in particular, should\ntranslate them into action.\nAmong these concepts, the principle of solidarity,\nis for us more than just assisting the poor and\nunderdeveloped. Solidarity is an operational principle\nthat should generate cooperative attitudes for countries\nin need, including those plagued by terrorism, natural\nand man-made disasters and calamities, weak State\nstructures, and so forth.\nOne of the most important issues, in the light of\nthe particularly threatening nexus of terrorism and\nweapons of mass destruction, is the principle of the\nnon-use of force. The following aspects should be\nexamined: anticipatory self-defence, humanitarian\nintervention and collective use of force with\nauthorization by the Security Council.\nIn this respect, we need a code of conduct that\nwill give us sufficient predictability as to how we, as\nMembers of the United Nations, will act on the\ninternational scene when employing the United Nations\nas our instrument of choice and how we will make the\nbest use of its potential.\nWe also hope that the reform will strengthen the\nrole of the United Nations as a community of values.\nThe United Nations was born to unite its Members\nagainst threats and enemies. Today, it should unite us\nfor positive change in the consolidation of values, such\nas human rights, democracy, social justice, and\ndevelopment, which constitute the backbone and moral\nfoundation of humankind.\nWhen preparing future decisions, we should\ndiscuss not only the content but also the form. Poland\nbelieves that the best approach to this is to have a\npolitical document that would both spell out the\nreinforced message about the role, principles and\nvalues, and also contain the necessary institutional\nadjustments. We most definitely regard this document\nas something more than a set of amendments to the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nWe have to completely change the way we\nperceive the United Nations. For many years, most of\nour countries have been asking themselves what they\ncan get from the Organization. Today, it is time for all\nof us to secure the future of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir,\non your assumption of the high office of President of\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly and\nassure you of Sri Lanka\u2019s fullest support and\ncooperation as you undertake the onerous\nresponsibility of presiding over the deliberations of the\nAssembly. I also thank the outgoing President, The\nHonourable Julian Hunte, for his able and efficient\nconduct of the fifty-eighth session.\nThe International Day of Peace we celebrate\ntoday is indeed a significant event in the United\nNations calendar. It is a day dedicated to the creation\nand pursuit of a culture of peace. As I speak today in\nthis Hall of peace, men, women and children in my\ncountry are celebrating the Day of Peace through a\nwide variety of civil society events. Prayers and\nmeditations, the resonating chimes of bells and the\ngentle glow of candlelight are powerful symbols of our\ndeep collective yearning for peace.\nWe recognize that the pursuit of peace requires\nmore than symbols. It requires consistent commitment,\npatience, perseverance and, above all, resolute action\nand consensus-building.\nPeace and the resolution of conflict through\ndialogue take centre stage in the world today and hence\nneed to be accorded the highest priority on the United\nNations agenda. All of us here are only too aware that\npeace is not the simple absence of war; it entails an\nactive engagement to understand and address the root\ncauses that endanger peace and generate conflict.\nIn Sri Lanka, my Government has for 10 years\nimplemented a series of programmes to engage the\narmed group that has been engaged in armed conflict in\ncomprehensive peace negotiations. We face the\nchallenges posed by an armed group using terror and\nsuicide bombs in pursuit of its demand for a separate\nState. My Government has adopted the policy that all\nconflicts have deep-rooted and real causes, and that we\nmust sift those causes from the acts of violence and\nterror and find the means to redress them. We believe\nthat a lasting solution to conflict lies along the path of\npower-sharing between the centre and the regions\nwhere people of different communities live. We believe\nthat this path can be found only through negotiations\nand dialogue.\nWe abhor violence and war. We believe in life\nand in the celebration of all that is human and decent.\nWe believe that the moral justification of the State and\nof all human institutions, such as the United Nations, is\nthe protection and the safeguard of life. In numerous\nelections, my Government has requested and received\nmandates from our people to end the conflict through a\nnegotiated settlement. We are committed to achieving\npeace, a peace founded on democracy, respect for\nhuman rights, a pluralist polity and good governance.\nWe are fully aware that peace is not achieved\neasily. It is a constant struggle for mutual\n22\n\nunderstanding and reconciliation and the establishment\nof the rule of law, justice and equality.\nThe Buddha, popularly known as the Prince of\nPeace, preached at length about peace and all that is\nrequired to achieve it, both within each individual and\namong nations. I quote from the Dhammapada:\n\u201cVictory breeds hatred. The defeated live in pain.\nHappily the peaceful live, giving up victory and\ndefeat\u201d.\nWe are deeply saddened at the violence,\ninstability, loss of life and human suffering in Iraq. We\nin Sri Lanka know, and have experienced first-hand,\nthe impact of violence on society and the difficulty in\nfinding solutions to problems of governance that\nsatisfy all parties. As the Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative for Iraq recently pointed out, security\nmeasures alone will not suffice to end violence and\ncreate stability and peace. Political consensus-building,\nreconciliation, rehabilitation and the promotion of the\nrule of law are essential for democracy to take root.\nEqually important in today\u2019s interdependent,\nincreasingly globalized world is the commitment of the\ninternational community to remain engaged and to\nensure that Iraq does not become further plagued by\nviolence and fragmented along ethnic or religious\nlines.\nNone of us, as leaders and, above all, as mothers\nand fathers, can ever forget the sheer brutality of the\nterrorist attack earlier this month on a school in Beslan,\nin the Russian Federation, which led to the loss of so\nmany lives of children and adults. Terrorism in all its\nmanifestations must be condemned and fought\nrelentlessly and globally. While no cause justifies\nunleashing terror upon the innocent, such outrages\nmust make us redouble our efforts to address their root\ncauses and seek political and socio-economic\nexplanations and solutions to them.\nMy Government is firmly committed to the global\nendeavour to fight terrorism. We have signed and\nratified the United Nations conventions aimed at\ncombating that menace, and we continue to contribute\nto the process by chairing the Ad Hoc Committee on\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism. We\nhope that at this session of the General Assembly,\nsubstantial progress can be made on the draft\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\nand the draft convention on nuclear terrorism.\nSri Lanka believes in the United Nations and its\npotential to be the principal forum where the voice of\nthe poor, the defenceless and the weak is also heard, as\nmuch as the voice of the rich and powerful. In that\nregard, we applaud the words today of Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who made a passionate appeal for\nupholding the rule of law, without discrimination,\nthroughout the world. We congratulate him on the\ncourageous leadership he gives to our world body. It\ngives us confidence and hope at this moment of human\nhistory when we question our collective ability to lead\nhumanity towards peace and prosperity.\nWe also recognize the need for reform to render\nthe United Nations more responsive to the needs and\naspirations of all its Member States. We look forward\nto the recommendations to be presented at this session\nof the General Assembly by the High-Level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change, appointed by the\nSecretary-General.\nThere is general agreement that the Security\nCouncil, as now constituted, does not reflect current\ngeo-political realities. We share the concern over the\nlack of progress on the question of equitable regional\nrepresentation and on an increase in the membership of\nthe Security Council in both the permanent and non-\npermanent categories. For many years, the developing\ncountries have consistently urged that the composition\nof the Security Council be broadened to accommodate\nthe basic principles of democratic representation,\nincluding representation of the developing countries. In\nthat context, we observe that Asia, the most populous\ncontinent and home to expanding economic\npowerhouses of the world, is grossly underrepresented\nin the present Council.\nWe take note that four countries \u2014 Brazil,\nGermany, India and Japan \u2014 will announce their\nparticipation in a compact under which they will\ncollectively support their respective candidatures for\npermanent status in an expanded Security Council. Sri\nLanka supports their candidatures, as they comply with\nthe objective criteria applicable to the expansion of the\npermanent membership of the Security Council. Sri\nLanka would also wish to see a consensus emerge on\nthe permanent representation of Africa in the Security\nCouncil. Africa must be included in a final\ndetermination on the future composition of the Security\nCouncil. It is also hoped that the Open-Ended Working\nGroup will continue to exert efforts to resolve all\noutstanding issues expeditiously.\n23\n\nWe propose that the General Assembly,\nrepresenting all Member States of the United Nations,\nshould play a larger and more active role as a\ndeliberative and decision-making body.\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, four years\nago, we forged a consensus to pursue a vision of an\ninclusive globalization process that provides benefits to\nthe widest possible segments of society. Setting aside\nthe commonplace clich\u00e9s about globalization, we\nagreed on a number of goals to be implemented within\nspecific time frames.\nMy Government\u2019s economic and social\ndevelopment programmes were planned and put into\naction 10 years ago. We have now made the necessary\nchanges to align our plans more closely with the\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals. The\nSri Lankan Government\u2019s strategy for development\nseeks a constructive partnership between a strong and\naccountable private sector, including foreign investors,\nand a robust and responsive public sector. The major\nthrust of our vision is to eliminate poverty, reduce\ninequalities and enhance the standard of living among\nthe various sectors of our population, thus providing\nequal opportunities for all.\nOn the subject of social progress, I must\ncommend the United Nations for its continued\ncommitment and perseverance in promoting and\nprotecting children\u2019s rights. Apart from guaranteeing\nthe rights of every child to education and good health\nservices, Sri Lanka believes that children must be\nprotected from abuse of all\ntypes \u2014 sexual, alcohol, drugs and tobacco. We have\nadopted measures to combat those evils.\nChildren in some of our countries suffer from the\nignominious practice of being used as child soldiers. In\nSri Lanka, we are addressing the problem of child\nconscription by the armed group, by seeking to engage\nthat group in the process of negotiations and by\nsupporting the activities spear-headed by UNICEF and\nby civil society organizations.\nOur economic strategy is market driven but\ngeared to achieve human development and prosperity\nat the grass roots level. We have crafted a policy and\nlaunched programmes to channel development efforts\nand resources to domestic capacity-builders at the\nvillage level who are the pillars of our national\neconomy. The majority of our population live in the\nrural areas and depend on agriculture for their\nlivelihood. Promotion of small- and medium-scale\nenterprises is therefore vital to sustain development.\nSri Lanka draws strength from the recognition the\nUnited Nations has granted to small and medium\nindustrialists in the developing world by declaring\n2005 as the Year for Micro-Credit.\nWe witness with concern the emergence of a\ncontrived association of certain religious beliefs with\nsome groups of fanatics. Extremism, violence and\nterrorism are the complete antithesis of the ethical and\nspiritual foundation of all religious philosophies and\npractices. We should work resolutely to prevent those\naberrations from becoming irreversible trends.\nOn the other hand, we are disturbed to witness\nreligious symbols being defamed or abused for\ncommercial purposes. Whether the symbols belong to\nthe Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish or any\nother faith, such abuse should be condemned and\nprohibited. The recent phenomenon of Buddhist\nsymbols being used for commercial purposes, thus\ncausing pain of mind to Buddhists all over the world is\na case in point. Fortunately, most of those\norganizations have agreed to refrain from such abuse in\nthe future. Sri Lanka, together with other like-minded\nStates, has brought the situation to the attention of\nUNESCO and other relevant intergovernmental bodies.\nWe propose that the United Nations call upon those\nresponsible to pay due respect to religious symbols and\npractices. That would be a fitting contribution by the\nUnited Nations to its own initiative on a dialogue\namong civilizations.\nThis year Sri Lanka will begin events to celebrate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of our membership of the\nUnited Nations that falls next year in 2005. On that\noccasion, we will renew our commitment to the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. We\nexpect the Organization to provide leadership in the\ntask of creating a world where understanding and\nharmony prevail, along with economic, scientific and\ntechnological advancement.\nMy commitment \u2014 and that of my Government\nand the people of Sri Lanka \u2014 to the United Nations\nremains undiminished. Our hope is that all Member\nStates will cooperate fully with the United Nations to\nrealize the Goals of the Millennium Declaration.\nFinally, I would like to say that our noble words,\nunless translated quickly into palpable deeds, will\nremain no more than a silent testimonial to our\n24\n\ncollective unwillingness or incapacity to transform the\nlives of our peoples when they cry out for attention and\nredress. If all that the United Nations can do for them\nis to churn out, periodically, ritual phrases and hollow\ninvocations to duty and responsibility, their frustration\nwill swell and spread globally, challenging peace and\nstability. That must not happen.\nLet us leave this session of the General Assembly\nnot only with renewed commitment to the ideals of the\nOrganization, but with renewed vigour to address our\nawesome responsibilities for alleviating the plight of\nthe poor, the hungry, the disadvantaged and the\noppressed."

        "file_text": "I feel\nespecially proud as an African to see that Mr. Jean Ping\nis presiding over this session of the General Assembly.\nI believe that his qualities as a human being and his\nvast experience are a valuable asset to the United\nNations at a difficult time in international relations,\nwhen the Organization must play an even greater role\nin accordance with its mission and the expectations of\nthe peoples of the world. In order to discharge fully its\nresponsibilities and the tasks entrusted to it, the United\nNations must now adjust and adapt, and must reform\nthe structures and machinery that will enable it to\nstrengthen its capacity for action.\nThere is still much tension in the international\nsituation; indeed, new sources of instability and\nuncertainty are appearing. A comprehensive approach\nis required, given the inextricable interdependence of\nall those issues on all levels - political, economic,\nsocial and cultural. Today more than ever, security is\none and indivisible. Security cannot even be conceived\nof without a determined struggle against terrorism. It\ncannot shirk the requirement that it step up efforts for\nconflict settlement and prevention, nor can it disregard\nthe pressing need to encourage worldwide development\nthat is balanced, equitable and sustainable. It must be\nbased on genuine dialogue - a dialogue between\nreligions, cultures and civilizations.\nThere is no doubt at all that excellent work has\nbeen done, since the struggle against terrorism became\nthe absolute priority of the international community.\nYet, despite the efforts made and resources put towards\nthat struggle, there remains much to be done. In\nparticular, it is essential that we reach agreement\nquickly on a common definition of terrorism so that we\ncan be clear about the legitimacy of the struggle of\npeoples against foreign occupation and can stop\naccepting distorted, confused, ill-conceived viewpoints\nthat see terrorism as part of just one geographical\nregion, religion, culture or civilization. Drafting a\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism is more\nurgent and important than ever before. It is something\nwe have been calling for now, for more than ten years.\nVery close to Algeria, there is a conflict between\nthe Polisario Front and the Kingdom of Morocco that\nhas been going on for almost 30 years. It is a\ndecolonization issue that has not been resolved. The\nUnited Nations has clearly established that Western\nSahara remains a non-self-governing territory under\nSecurity Council resolution 1541 (2004). As in the case\nof Brunei, Surinam, Belize and Timor-Leste, the peace\nplan was unanimously accepted by the Security\nCouncil and provides a just and definitive framework\nfor a settlement, through the Saharawi people\u00eds free\nexercise of their inalienable right to self-determination.\nIn seeking a satisfactory solution, Algeria has\nalways supported the Secretary-General of the United\nNations and his personal envoy, Mr. James Baker, who\nhas truly earned the respect of our Organization for his\ntireless efforts. Algeria will continue to support the\nUnited Nations peace plan and remains fully available\nto contribute towards the implementation of the plan,\nin order to strengthen stability in our region and\nsolidarity among our peoples.\nHere I would reiterate that Algeria cannot decide\nthe future of the Western Sahara for its people and does\nnot want to do so. Any attempt to address the issue of\nthe Western Sahara in a context other than that of\ncompleting the decolonization process - part of the\nresponsibility of the United Nations - will result in\nthe failure of that process and will delay a final\nsettlement.\nIntensive efforts are underway within the African\nUnion to ensure peace and security in Africa, efforts\nthat are leading to prospects for settlement of regional\nconflicts. Those efforts reflect Africa\u00eds firm resolve to\nbecome part of a new era of stability, security and\nprogress.\nThe conditions for establishing a genuinely\nbalanced and mutually beneficial partnership between\nAfrica and its partners through the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u00eds Development (NEPAD), have never been as\nfavourable as they are today. A promising change in\nthat relationship is now emerging and gaining\nimportance. For that reason it is extremely important to\ncontinue encouraging Africa as it seeks to succeed in\nits work towards peace, development and integration,\nwhich it has firmly started.\n31\n\nIn the occupied Palestinian territories the peace\nprocess is deadlocked, more than ever before. It is now\nmore difficult to find a just and lasting solution to the\nArab-Israeli conflict because of the brutal repression of\nPalestinian civilians; endless attacks against the\nPalestinian Authority, its institutions and its leaders;\nthe continuation of a settlement policy; the building of\nthe separation wall, in violation of international law as\naffirmed by the International Court of Justice; Israel\u00eds\nrejection of obligations entered into in Oslo and its\nmanoeuvering to take everything of substance away\nfrom the road map.\nIn that same region, the Iraqi people face a tragic\nsituation and many complex challenges that require the\nsupport of the international community and the United\nNations.\nAt the dawn of the millennium, we all undertook\nto take up the challenges that we wanted to face\ntogether through a responsible global partnership. In all\nsincerity, can we be content with the meager results\nachieved to date? It is our hope that the summit in\n2005, incidentally the sixtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, will be an opportunity for us to\nconfirm our commitments and to finally take the bold\nsteps that are needed to translate commitments into\naction, to eradicate poverty, destitution and\ndeprivation, promote sustainable development and\nensure peace and stability for all peoples."

I am confident that under your\npresidency fruitful results will be achieved. I also wish\nto pay a cordial tribute to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\nThe recent appalling terror in Beslan, Russia,\ncaused massive casualties, including many children.\nOn behalf of the Chinese Government, I strongly\ncondemn, once again, that inhuman act of terrorist\nviolence and extend our deep condolences to the\nfamilies of the victims.\nPeace and development remain the dominant\nthemes in today\u2019s world.

Threats to security, both\ntraditional and non-traditional, are intertwined. The\ndark cloud of war remains menacing. Hot spots keep\nspringing up. Terrorist activities are raging, and cross-\nborder problems such as the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction, drug trafficking, transnational\ncrime and illegal immigration are erupting one after\nanother. Factors of uncertainty, instability and\nunpredictability are increasing.\nIn the course of economic globalization, the gap\nbetween the North and the South is widening.\nDeveloping countries are confronting new difficulties\nand challenges as a growing number of them are\nfurther marginalized. Today, half the global population\nlives on less than $2 a day, and of those, 1.2 billion live\non less than $1 a day. Much remains to be done to\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals.\nPeace, development and cooperation are the\nprerequisites for our times. People all over the world\nare raising their voice in favour of peace, development\nand cooperation and against war, poverty and\nconfrontation. Peace is the precondition for human\ndevelopment and prosperity. Without a peaceful and\nstable international environment, development is out of\nthe question for any country. A chaotic world benefits\nno one. Having experienced the scourge of two world\nwars, mankind would not tolerate any more war or\nbloodshed. Thus it is the fervent aspiration of all\npeoples to live and achieve development in a secure\nand stable environment.\nIn tackling security issues, it is imperative to\nfoster a new security concept of mutual trust, mutual\nbenefit, equality and cooperation. This new concept\ncalls for nations to transcend their differences in\nideology and social systems, respect one another\u2019s\nsecurity interests, promote greater democracy in\ninternational relations and seek peaceful solutions to\ndisputes through dialogue.\nTerrorism is the common enemy of the whole\nworld. China stands firmly opposed to terrorism in all\nforms and manifestations. To prevent and fight\nterrorism, we must intensify international cooperation\nand address both the causes and symptoms of the\nthreat. Only when the root causes of terrorism are\neradicated can peoples live in peace and tranquillity\nagain.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nposes a threat to world peace and security. Non-\nproliferation efforts therefore require the participation\nof all members of the international community.\nLikewise, it is important to discard unilateralism and\ndouble standards and to give full credit and full latitude\nto the role of the United Nations.\nChina takes an active part in multilateral non-\nproliferation efforts and firmly defends the\ninternational regime of arms control, disarmament and\nnon-proliferation treaties. China believes that\nmultilateral arms control, disarmament and non-\nproliferation processes can be steadily promoted in\norder to further improve the international non-\nproliferation regime.\nThere is still a long way to go before peace and\nreconstruction can be realized in Iraq. We support an\nimportant role for the United Nations in Iraq\u2019s political\nprocess, helping that country achieve the smooth\nholding of elections.\n10\n\nWe appeal to Palestine and Israel to resume\ndialogue as soon as possible and to start implementing\nthe Middle East road map faithfully. As always, China\nwill work to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean\nPeninsula through dialogue and talks, in the interest of\npeace and stability on the Peninsula.\nDevelopment is the foundation for human\nprogress. Lasting peace and stability throughout the\nworld depends on coordinated, balanced and universal\ndevelopment. Development is of overriding\nimportance. Living in peace, abundance and harmony\nbetween nations has been the dream of many\ngenerations. Coordinated, balanced and sustainable\ndevelopment serves the fundamental interests of all\npeoples and works for their well-being.\nIn order to promote economic growth worldwide,\nit is necessary for the international community to take\neffective measures to put in place an open and fair\nmultilateral trading regime and gradually improve it. It\nis also important to reform and improve the\ninternational financial system.\nThe developed countries must honour their\ncommitments to debt reduction, technology transfer\nand market access through concrete actions in order to\nenable developing countries to really benefit from\nglobalization. The developing countries, for their part,\nneed to work together to attain development and take\npart in a wide range of international efforts. They\nshould also deepen South-South cooperation.\nWe, the members of the international community,\nshould join hands in working for a just and equitable\nnew international economic order that meets the needs\nof the growing economic globalization and serves the\ncommon interests of all countries.\nThe Millennium Development Goals are our\nsolemn, collective pledge. The United Nations should\nfurther mobilize resources, strengthen coordination and\nincrease its input to development activities in order to\nhelp Member States achieve these important goals as\nscheduled.\nCooperation is an effective way of dealing with\nthe collective challenges facing humankind. To\nstrengthen international cooperation, we must\nchampion multilateralism. The United Nations is the\ncentre of the international multilateral system and the\nkey platform for making multilateralism work. It is the\nwidespread desire of the international community to\nadhere to the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter, take more collective actions,\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations and safeguard\nits authority.\nThe threats and challenges we face make it\nimperative to strengthen, rather than weaken, the role\nof the United Nations. A stronger United Nations is\nindispensable for maintaining global peace and\nstability and promoting the common development of\nhumankind. All Member States should honour their\ncommitments to the Charter of the United Nations and\nfulfil their international responsibilities and\nobligations.\nThe world is eagerly looking forward to a\ndynamic and action-oriented United Nations. China\nsupports necessary and rational reforms of the\nOrganization. Such reforms should aim at enhancing\nthe leading role of the United Nations in international\naffairs, reinforcing its capacity to tackle new threats\nand challenges, and ensuring that better reflects the\naspirations and needs of the vast majority of\ndeveloping countries.\nChina is in favour of expanding the Security\nCouncil and of giving priority to greater representation\nof the developing countries. China also supports the\nwork of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\nand Change, and it is looking forward to the Panel\u2019s\nreport by the end of this year, so that it can be reviewed\nby Member States.\nChina is a staunch force working for world peace,\ncommon development and international cooperation.\nAfter over half a century of strenuous efforts and more\nthan two decades of reform and opening up, China has\nnow entered a new stage of development aimed at\nbuilding a moderately prosperous society all-round.\nHowever, China is still a developing country, and a\nlarge population and inadequate economic\ndevelopment remain its basic national conditions. It\nhas a long way to go before achieving its development\ngoals.\nThe Chinese Government will always place\ndevelopment at the top of its agenda. The fact that\nChina \u2014 a large, developing country with 1.3 billion\npeople \u2014 runs its own affairs well is in itself a major\ncontribution to peace and to the development of\nhumanity.\n11\n\nChina desires peace, development and\ncooperation, and strives to win peace and development\nthrough cooperation. It is working to promote\ndemocracy in international relations, diversity in its\nmodes of development and richness in the world\u2019s\ncivilizations. It advocates a new security concept and\nfacilitates the establishment of a fair and equitable new\ninternational order.\nChina will pursue with determination an\nindependent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the five\nprinciples for Peaceful Coexistence, and engage in\nmutually beneficial and friendly cooperation with other\ncountries on an equal footing.\nChina will unswervingly safeguard its\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, brook no\ninterference in its internal affairs by foreign forces and,\nat the same time, respect other countries\u2019 sovereignty\nand territorial integrity.\nChina remains committed to the common\ninterests of humankind. China\u2019s national interests, in\nthe final analysis, are consistent with the common\ninterests of all humankind. In handling State-to-State\nrelations, China will safeguard its own interests while\ntaking into account the interests of other countries.\nChina will adhere to the policy of opening up, and\ndevelop economic relations and trade with all other\nnations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\nChina\u2019s development stands in the way of no one,\nnor does it pose any threat to others. China is following\nthe path of peaceful development, seeking an\ninternational environment of peace and stability for its\nown development and promoting world peace and\nprogress through its own prosperity.\nChina is working steadily to develop its relations\nwith the world\u2019s major countries. It will stay\ncommitted to the policy of building friendship and\npartnership with its neighbours and combine stronger\nbilateral friendships with enhanced regional\ncooperation. It will strengthen solidarity and\ncooperation with other developing countries and\nsupport any justified demands or legitimate\npropositions on their part in international affairs. It will\nplay a constructive role in the political, economic,\nsocial, disarmament, arms control and other\nmultilateral fields; safeguard the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\nrelations; and support any consensus that serves the\ncommon interests of all countries.\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\nSafeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and realizing complete national reunification\nat an early date is the common will and firm resolve of\nthe 1.3 billion Chinese people. Pursuing the policy of\n\u201cpeaceful reunification and one country, two systems\u201d,\nthe Chinese Government is ready to work tirelessly\ntowards a peaceful reunification with the utmost\nsincerity. We, more than anyone else, want to see a\npeaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. But we\nwill never tolerate Taiwan independence, nor will we\nallow anyone to separate Taiwan from the rest of China\nin any way.\nWe hope that the international community will\nfully recognize the complex and sensitive nature of the\ncurrent situation across the Taiwan Strait and the\nserious threat posed by the separatist activities of the\nTaiwan authorities to the stability of the Taiwan Strait\nand the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. We expect the\nAssembly to continue supporting the Chinese\nGovernment\u2019s efforts for peaceful reunification and to\njoin us in containing pro-independence activities, in the\ninterest of stability in the Strait and of world peace.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As the basic\nguidelines for State-to-State relations, the Five\nPrinciples have withstood the test of half a century and\nremain an irrefutable truth. The Five Principles, which\ninclude peace, development and cooperation, are\nconsistent with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations. They provide guidance\nfor the establishment and development of relations\nbetween countries with identical or different social\nsystems; point to the correct path towards the peaceful\nsettlement of outstanding issues between countries and\ninternational disputes; firmly defend the interests of the\ndeveloping countries; and facilitate the improvement\nand development of North-South relations. The Five\nPrinciples present important ideas that must underpin\nthe establishment of a fair and equitable new\ninternational order.\nChina not only initiated, but has faithfully\nobserved, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.\nGiven the new realities of today, we will continue to\nchampion those Principles and join all the peoples of\n12\n\nthe world in advancing the lofty cause of peace,\ndevelopment and cooperation."

        "file_text": "I\nhave the honour to represent the President of Ecuador,\nMr. Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez Borb\u00faa, and the people of Ecuador\nin this world forum of nations, to affirm once again\nthat my country, Ecuador, is an ally of States\ncommitted to peace and the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes. Ecuador is a law-abiding country, upholds the\nprinciple of international security and solidarity and is\na staunch defender of all the mandates arising from the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nIt is worth highlighting once again that Ecuador,\nin its relations with the international community,\nopposes all forms of discrimination or segregation,\ncolonialism or neocolonialism. On this occasion, the\nGovernment of Ecuador must once again ask the\ncommunity of nations and the international financial\norganisms to not lose sight of the heavy burden on our\ncountries represented by the service of the debt, which,\nyear after year, severely strains our economies. The\nEcuadorian Government calls on the United Nations to\nmove forward with greater determination in identifying\nspecific actions aimed at effectively reducing existing\npressures, and, furthermore, in formulating proposals\nto efficiently address with this issue in the long term\nand enable our countries to develop.\nThe Government of Ecuador must also draw\nattention to one of the most momentous problems\nafflicting the international community, namely the\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict. This terrible\nproblem reflects a reality entirely at odds with the most\nelementary ethical and moral principles of human\nconduct and that destroys the basic premises of\ncivilized co-existence, in which respect for life and the\ndignity of all individuals must necessarily be a priority.\nIt is time for the international community and the\nUnited Nations to give absolute priority to this issue\nand to find the political will and determination to\ntackle and eliminate every bloody and inhuman\nconflict in which international humanitarian law no\nlonger prevails. The Security Council is duty-bound, in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, to\nreinforce the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,\nin order to avoid undermining the entire international\njuridical structure.\nTrue to its international commitments and its\nhumanitarian vocation, Ecuador has been welcoming\nthousands of refugees and immigrants from Colombia\nand other countries who have fled their countries\nbecause their lives, freedom and economic security\nhave been threatened. We must remind the\ninternational community that, in order to solve this\ncritical situation, we need the commitment of every\ncountry and international organism. For this reason, it\nis essential that in conformity with principles of shared\nresponsibility and shared burdens, countries, such as\nEcuador, which take in refugees and immigrants,\nshould receive greater technical and economic support.\nThis support is necessary to alleviate the social burden\nresulting from large numbers of persons entering local\nborder communities, which experience higher levels of\npoverty and lack basic services.\nWith regard to the analysis of the northern border\nof Ecuador made by the United Nations inter-agency\nmission, we appreciate the support offered by the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to implement the\ndevelopment proposals suggested in the report.\nEcuador would also like to have the support of the\ninternational community and the international financial\ninstitutions in this undertaking.\n51\n\nThe Government of Ecuador urges the\ninternational community to make good its commitment\nto the implementation of programmes established by\nEcuador and Peru within the framework of the\nbi-national development plan for their common border,\nfollowing the signing of the peace agreements in\nBrasilia in 1998. These projects aim at meeting the\nbasic needs of the populations of the region, through\nsocial programmes and infrastructure projects.\nHowever, both Ecuador and Peru require the financial\nsupport of the countries that pledged their assistance\nfor the post-conflict era.\nTo our countries\u2019 development problems we must\nadd the persistent trade barriers which developed\ncountries impose on our exportable products, as well as\nthe subsidies worth millions that they grant to their\nown products, especially agricultural ones, which\nseriously limit normal competition among countries,\nincrease unemployment and threaten the future of the\neducation, health and well-being of our peoples.\nDeteriorating conditions in developing countries\nhave resulted in increased flows of migrants towards\nindustrialized centres in search of employment, which\nis no longer available in their own countries. In some\ncountries, this exodus has met with restrictive and\nunfair policies based on xenophobic concepts that,\ninstead of providing a solution to the existing problem\nand to its root causes, make it even worse.\nInternational migration is a problem that has\ngrown more severe during the last decade. Each year,\nmore countries are affected by migration movements,\nwhich are commanding increasing attention at the\ndecision-making level. Migration reflects the human\nlonging to have the opportunity to pursue a better\nquality of life and enjoy greater economic prospects. It\nalso promotes exchange and understanding between\npeoples, strengthens dialogue and adds cultural and\neconomic enrichment.\nThe history of humanity is inconceivable without\nconstant migratory flows. It is evident, then, that the\nconsequences of these migration movements have\neconomic, political, social and demographic effects, as\nmuch for the countries of departure as for those of\narrival. In this context, and in this current era of market\nglobalization, emphasis must be placed on the\nliberalization of the supply of services via the free\nmovement of persons.\nEcuador is strongly committed to cooperating in\nthe search for solutions to this huge problem through a\nstrict control of the illegal migration of persons and the\nelaboration of universal agreements that favour the\ndevelopment of human beings within their respective\ncountries. However, to this end we require active\ncooperation between migrant source and recipient\ncountries, as well as from international organizations.\nMy country has traditionally maintained a policy\nof promoting, respecting and protecting the human\nrights of migrants, and for this reason, from this\nGeneral Assembly, I would like to appeal to all\nGovernments and all sectors of society, particularly\nthose of the developed world that receive migrant\nworkers, to direct their efforts towards the protection\nof the rights of this vulnerable sector of society in a\nnon-discriminatory manner, taking into consideration\nthe highly positive and productive aspects of\nmigration.\nThe territory of Ecuador is home to 12\nnationalities and more than 17 ethnic groups. This\ndiversity has been recognized in the Constitution of the\nRepublic, which defines Ecuador as a social democracy\nthat promotes the equitable distribution of welfare. The\nfundamental charter of the Ecuadorian State lays down\na legal framework that promotes the participation of\nethnic minorities in political structures and processes\nand guarantees the exercise of the constitutional rights\nof these groups in the public and private spheres.\nThe Government of my country cannot fail to\nmention that inequality has been, and continues to be,\nthe greatest impediment to economic development and\npoverty alleviation in many developing countries. The\ndisparity of wealth and income currently evident within\nand among many countries is a matter of concern for\nthe international community. In order to prevent this\ninequality, we need to adopt effective multilateral\nmeasures aimed at effectively reducing poverty, which\nin itself constitutes an affront to human dignity and\nconsequently harms the rights of individuals.\nIn this sense, it has become imperative that the\nintent of international summits addressing issues of\ndevelopment and poverty eradication become manifest\nthrough internal plans and programs based on enhanced\ninternational cooperation.\nThe Government of Ecuador supports these\nactivities, which are embodied in three key areas:\npoverty reduction, political governance and\n52\n\ntransparency, and sustainable development through\nequitable access to natural resources. This commitment\nhas led Ecuador to be chosen as an example for the\nimplementation of innovative models, with the goal of\noptimizing the assistance and the quality of the\ncountry\u2019s response.\nI believe it is essential that the voice of my\ncountry be heard on the topic of terrorism. This\nphenomenon has endangered the equilibrium, peace,\nharmony, and security of the planet. It has torn the\nsocio-political fabric of societies, damaged financial\nstructures and undermined the functioning of States\u2019\nsecurity apparatus.\nI wish to reiterate the most unreserved support\nand backing of the Government of Ecuador for all\ninitiatives and actions created to fight international\nterrorism in all its forms and characteristics, but always\nwithin the framework of the decisions of the United\nNations, of international law and of absolute respect\nfor human rights.\nWe must highlight the fact that hunger, ill health,\npoverty, great economic disparities, lack of respect for\nhuman rights, corruption, attempts to resolve disputes\nand conflicts by non-peaceful means and the growing\nweight of external debt are the seeds of international\ninstability and insecurity; they undermine governance\nand are factors that destabilize democratic institutions.\nThe international community must become fully aware\nof the fact that these harsh daily realities confronting\ndeveloping countries also represent a threat to world\nsecurity. Therefore, we must directly combat terrorism\nwith a broad-based and concerted global strategy to\nfoster development, improve the living conditions of a\nlarge part of the marginalized world population and\nencourage dialogue and tolerance, both between human\nbeings and among States.\nThe international community needs to make the\nprotection and security of individuals a global policy\nobjective. The security of the State, of society and of\nindividuals requires a consideration of the threats to\ntheir fundamental values, which are sovereignty,\nidentity and survival. Only on that basis must we\nestablish the parameters of political, economic and\nmilitary action in a globalized world.\nEcuador, as a founding Member of the United\nNations, resolutely supports the multilateral system,\nsince it constitutes the best guarantee for the full\noperation of the purposes and principles that led to its\ncreation and which are enshrined in its Charter. As a\nresult, Ecuador fully supports the current process of\nreform of the United Nations, particularly of its main\nbodies, such as the Security Council, along with the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We are\nconvinced that that will contribute to more effective\naction in the fulfilment of its mission.\nMy country wishes to highlight the statement\nmade here by the Prime Minister of Spain \u2014 his words\nof solidarity with the cause of Latin American peoples\nand his commitment to support the reduction of debt\nand of inequalities, as well as to promote and\nstrengthen relations between the European Union and\nLatin America. Ecuador welcomes this expression of\ngood will shown by Spain\u2019s Prime Minister, since\nachieving those goals will contribute to the welfare of\nthe peoples.\nFinally, democracy and respect for Governments\nlegitimately established through popular vote are the\ngreatest triumphs of Latin America in recent decades.\nNo attempt whatsoever should be made to revise this\nbasic principle of international policy, lest we seriously\naffect the system of normal coexistence among nations.\nIn conclusion, allow me to urge the international\ncommunity to always bear in mind the precious ideals\nof human beings that inspire this Organization, as set\nforth in the Preamble to its Charter, which are the\nfundamental mandates for its Members and various\nbodies."

        "file_name": "PRT_59_2004.txt",
        "file_text": "At the outset,\nI would like to state that Portugal, of course, endorses\nthe statement made here by the presidency of the\nEuropean Union. Portugal wishes the United Nations to\nfulfil the central role it rightly deserves in the\ncommunity of nations. The United Nations is an\nindispensable international Organization. Without this\nbody, of which we are all a part, the world would be\nmore unstable, less predictable and a place where the\nuniversal dream of peace and freedom would be no\nmore than a mirage on a far-off horizon.\nThe United Nations was established in a distant\nhistorical context, but its ideas and basic values remain\ncontemporary. Portugal has a habit of recalling them,\non occasions such as this, because we feel that this\ncommon undertaking is based on solid foundations.\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d believe in the\ndignity and the value of the human being, in\nfundamental freedoms and in equality between men\nand women. We defend the primacy of international\nlaw and tolerance in relations between peoples.\nBut we also believe that one should not\ndistinguish between large and small nations, as we all\nhave a common interest in social advancement and in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nThese are the objectives of this Organization that need\nto be preserved and strengthened. This is, in good\ntruth, our common cause, the cause of humankind.\nThe month of September, in this city of New\nYork, inevitably brings back memories of the horror of\nthree years ago. It forces us to look at the challenges to\npeace that this Organization and all of us face today.\nThe tragic events in Madrid, Beslan, Baghdad, Jakarta\nand other places show us that terrorism has entered the\ndeepest and darkest of shadows.\nNo cause, no idea, justifies acts of pure barbarism\nand the spilling of innocent blood. Terrorism is an\nenemy of humankind. Moreover, Portugal believes that\nit is up to the United Nations to contribute decisively\nto the establishment of a global strategy against\nterrorism \u2014 a strategy that takes into account not only\nthe obvious security-related responses, but also other\nelements that may have the potential to generate\nviolence.\n33\n\nLet us be unyielding in the fight against\nterrorism, but let us also engage ourselves in doing it\ncollectively. Let us take into account the laws and the\nvalues in whose name we are fighting, and should be\nfighting, this evil.\nHunger and poverty generate despair and may\ncause people to choose the path of violence. I would\ntherefore like to express my appreciation for the\nSummit of World Leaders for Action against Hunger\nand Poverty, promoted by President Lula da Silva,\nwhich I had the honour to attend. We believe that that\nmeeting was a fundamental step towards alleviating\ncases of extreme poverty, which are unsustainable in\nmoral and political terms.\nIf we act now, the world can change for the\nbetter; if we do not, its balance could become\nincreasingly difficult to manage. Portugal wants to be\nat the forefront of the future. That is why we believe\nthat the sustainability of development and the defence\nof natural resources are paradigms of a new era. We\nbelieve that the economic development of the twenty-\nfirst century will be sustainable only if it truly respects\nthe balance of the planet and if the Kyoto provisions\nare truly implemented.\nDoes it make sense that an Organization like the\nUnited Nations continues to work in the twenty-first\ncentury as it did 60 years ago? The United Nations was\nborn at a time when there were no televisions, no\ncomputers, no cellular phones. Communications,\ntechnologies and means of transportation have all\nchanged; DNA and the human genome have now been\ndiscovered; we surf the Internet on a global scale. And\nyet the Organization that brings together the peoples of\nthe world has the same structure that it had more than\nhalf a century ago.\nThe pace of change is breathtaking. The United\nNations finds itself at a crossroads: while its relevance\nis not challenged, we may question its effectiveness.\nBut that is an issue that should be placed primarily\nbefore Member States. After all, the United Nations is\nan expression of our collective will. The Organization\ncannot be seen as a distant reflection on which we\nproject our individual expectations, which often exceed\nthe limits of the mandates and the means that we make\navailable to it.\nIn that regard, we support the work of the High-\nLevel Panel established last year by the Secretary-\nGeneral to examine current challenges to peace and\nsecurity. The strategies for strengthening the\nOrganization to be recommended by the Panel aim at\npreserving what is best in the United Nations and at\nensuring that it is equipped with the means necessary\nto promote real development, prevent conflicts and\nprotect human rights.\nPortugal unequivocally supports reform of the\nSecurity Council. We support its enlargement so that it\nwill better reflect the world of today, through a\nrebalancing of its representativity. We have already\nstated before this forum \u2014 and we reaffirm today \u2014\nour support for an increase in the number of permanent\nand non-permanent members. Portugal\u2019s support for\nBrazil, Germany and Japan has been known to the\nGeneral Assembly since 1993. We have already\nexpressed our support for India\u2019s application for\ncandidacy, and, on behalf of the Government of\nPortugal, I take the opportunity to express our\ncommitment to seeing the African continent\nrepresented by a permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil.\nBut we also want to improve the relationship\nbetween the Council and other organs and agencies of\nthe United Nations, as well as promoting greater\ntransparency in its decisions. The democracy that the\nOrganization defends is not compatible with obsolete\nworking methods that often have a negative impact on\nthe image and the credibility of the United Nations and\nlead to its paralysis.\nPreventing conflicts is more important than\nsolving them. We should be aware that the usefulness\nof the United Nations will ultimately be judged by its\ncapacity for conflict prevention. The proliferation of\ncrisis situations has led to the current deployment of\napproximately 60,000 Blue Helmets in peacekeeping\noperations, and that number continues to increase.\nPortugal has been with the United Nations in\nmany of its peacekeeping operations around the world.\nHere, I would like to pay tribute to my compatriots and\nto all others who have served on peacekeeping\nmissions, particularly those who have given their lives\nfor our common ideals.\nIt is our hope that the Organization can better\ndevelop its work in the field of conflict prevention.\nHowever, we still lack an efficient instrument for the\ndevelopment of that policy. Therefore, at the last\nsession of the General Assembly, Portugal proposed\nthe creation of a commission to promote peace and\n34\n\ndevelopment, under the authority of and in\ncollaboration with the Security Council and the\nEconomic and Social Council. Its objectives would be\nto regularly monitor countries in crisis or at risk and to\nensure the cooperation6 of regional and international\ninstitutions.\nWe believe that our proposal remains relevant,\nand we thank all those who have already improved it\nthrough suggestions and comments. This is an idea on\nwhich we have worked in particular with our partners\nin the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries,\nwhich I would like to warmly acknowledge on this\noccasion.\nIndeed, the Portuguese language is the unifying\nfactor among hundreds of millions of people on five\ncontinents. So that it can have strength as a vehicle of\ncommunication and culture in the twenty-first century,\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries\nneeds its members to make a clear commitment to the\nconnection between the past, the present and the future.\nThe fact that Portugal is the cradle of the Portuguese\nlanguage does not lead us to claim it for ourselves\nalone with any special rights. The communities that\none joins as a result of specific interests, however\nlegitimate, can never erase one\u2019s own community \u2014\none\u2019s family, spirit, language, culture and identity.\n\u201cKnow thyself\u201d was already inscribed at the foot of the\nTemple of Delphi.\nNowhere are we confronted with such a huge\npredicament regarding the ability of the United Nations\nto act as in Iraq. Iraq needs the support of the\ninternational community. The Iraqi people, ravaged by\ndecades of dictatorship and war, deserve such support.\nAnd we should give the United Nations the necessary\nmeans to fulfil in its entirety the mandate provided by\nthe Security Council. But we must also understand\nclearly that the international presence in Iraq \u2014\napproved by the Security Council and by the Iraqi\nInterim Government \u2014 is by its own nature\nprovisional.\nIt is time for the international community to unite\nin its efforts to ensure that the Iraqi people again find\nthe path towards peace and development. We cannot\nchange the past, but we must assume that the future can\nstill be influenced in a positive way. Thus, we must\nquickly restore unity if our Organization is not to suffer\npermanent collateral damage as a result of the Iraqi\ncrisis.\nFor democracy to succeed in Iraq, and for that\ncountry to maintain its unity, it is essential that its\npeople have a say, through elections, regarding the way\nthey wish to be governed. It is also important that the\nagreed political timetable be honoured, or we may\nseriously compromise the rightful expectations of the\nIraqi people and Government. We cannot allow those\nwho generate instability through unthinkable acts of\nterrorism to have the power to veto the establishment\nof a democratic regime in Iraq. Elections are the only\nway to enable the Iraqi people to meet the destiny of\ndemocracy and freedom to which they are entitled.\nPeace, freedom and democracy are also at stake\nin other parts of the world we inhabit. We cannot look\naway from the tragedy unfolding in Darfur. Our\ncollective security also requires the effective\ninternational control of the production of nuclear,\nchemical and bacteriological weapons and the means to\ndeploy them.\nFor the maintenance of international security, it is\nalso essential that the Organization continues to push\nfor the resumption of the Middle East peace process.\nThe existing status quo is unacceptable. Israel and\nPalestine need to learn to coexist in peace and security,\nwithin internationally recognized borders and without\nartificial partitions.\nWe cannot replace the dichotomy between\nliberalism and collectivism with another between\nliberty and peace on the one hand and terror and\ndictatorship on the other. The world has already\nentered a new era. The peoples of the whole world, as\nreferred to in the Charter of the United Nations,\ndemand a new contract between the governed and those\nwho govern.\nThe three classic powers of Montesquieu are no\nlonger the only ones in the government of the peoples.\nThose who believe so are lost in time. There is nothing\nworse than erring in our perception of reality. There are\npowers that are not as they were and others that\nMontesquieu, Locke and the drafters of liberal\nrevolutions could not know of, because they did not\nexist or because, over time, they have changed\nconfiguration. One need only think of the power of the\nmedia over people\u2019s lives today.\nOur peoples want to feel strength in the present\nand faith in the future. For that reason, I shall end my\naddress the way I began: stressing the indispensability\nand the centrality of the United Nations in the daily\n35\n\nlives of free and sovereign nations. We belong to an\nOrganization that has restored hope to many peoples\nand human beings by bringing the light of freedom to\nthose who lived in oppression. Timor-Leste is an\nexcellent example of the ability of the United Nations\nto do good.\nBut one should also stress the attention the\nUnited Nations has given to the vulnerable, children\nand the disabled and to the promotion of gender\nequality. For this Organization, humankind is not an\nabstract entity. The dialogue between cultures,\ncivilizations and religions, which Portugal upholds, is\nan integral part of the daily work of the United\nNations.\nWe are part of an Organization dedicated to\nmaking peace and preventing war. We are party to a\ncollective project in the service of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. We have the strength of our\nconvictions. And, as Pope John Paul II has stated, we\nknow that peace is not weakness, but strength."

        "file_text": " The\ncurrent session of the General Assembly is of critical\nimportance to us, not only because of the urgent\nquestions on our agenda, but also because of the\ndistinct honour bestowed upon Africa through your\nsplendid election to the presidency of our venerable\nAssembly. Burkina Faso congratulates you warmly\nand, in its capacity as Vice-President of the Assembly,\npledges you its full and complete cooperation so that\nyou may successfully fulfil your tasks.\nI also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian Hunte, who effectively guided the\ndeliberations of the fifty-eighth session.\nOur Assembly is meeting at a time when the\ninternational community finds itself confronted with\ngrowing poverty in the countries of the South,\nterrorism and fratricidal wars. On the African\ncontinent, we can certainly welcome restored peace in\nAngola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but Africa continues\nto be riven by many conflicts, particularly in Burundi,\nC\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand the Sudan. In Iraq, an uncontrollable situation is\ngradually plunging that country into chaos, while\ndialogue still seems to be impossible among the\nprotagonists in the Middle East. In the struggle against\nterrorism, we must humbly acknowledge that we are\nfar from having developed an appropriate and effective\nstrategy to eradicate that scourge. Killing and the\ndestruction of human life are on the rise in several\nregions of the world.\nAnd yet, people of good will and international\nassociations and organizations remain mobilized to\noffer solutions and to restore harmony. That is\nexemplified by the peace initiatives of the Southern\nAfrica Development Community in the Great Lakes\n8\n\nregion, of the African Union in Darfur, and of the\nAccra summit on the crisis in C\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire, which,\nunder the sponsorship of the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, has revived a spark of hope for\nnational reconciliation in that country. The\nGovernment and the people of Burkina Faso reaffirm\ntheir support for the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III\nAgreements. I wish to reiterate Burkina Faso\u00eds\ncommitment to joining any initiative aimed at\nconsolidating peace and stability on the continent.\nPeace and security are not the sole safeguards of\norder and global political stability. In its ability to\nsatisfy the basic needs of mankind, human security is\nanother important aspect thereof. Ever since the 1995\nWorld Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen,\nthe international community has recognized that the\ngreatest challenge confronting humankind is that of\npoverty. Poverty compromises fundamental human\nrights, undermines the dignity of individuals and\nfamilies, and threatens the political, economic and\nsocial stability of States.\nOf what value is globalization if it ignores such\nessential concerns of peoples as economic progress,\nnutrition, health, education and employment? The\nespecially alarming situation in Africa must be recalled\nin this Assembly: a feeble growth rate, an ongoing\ndecline in per capita production, a slow increase in the\nliteracy and education rates, the ravages of hunger and\naffliction, endemic underemployment and a disturbing\nlag in science and technology.\nIn the face of such a state of affairs, African\nleaders have undertaken to show more leadership in the\nformulation of economic and social policies. The\nconvening of an African Union summit in\nOuagadougou on 8 and 9 September on employment\nand poverty alleviation in Africa was an example of\nthat growing awareness and new vision. In the course\nof that meeting, together with our development\npartners, we agreed that macroeconomic stability and\nsustained growth are necessary, but insufficient to\nreduce poverty. We therefore agreed, inter alia, to make\nemployment the centrepiece of our economic and\nsocial policies and to strengthen cooperation between\nthe regional economic communities in the areas of\nemployment, training and health care. The\nOuagadougou conference also decided to establish a\nfollow-up mechanism for decisions made at the\nnational, regional and continental levels.\nAfrica needs the effective assistance of the\ninternational community to enhance the quality of its\neconomic choices in order to improve the living\nconditions of its peoples. From this rostrum, I therefore\ncall on our development partners to act along three\nprincipal vectors. First, they must respect the\ncommitments undertaken at various forums to increase\nofficial development assistance and to provide\nsignificant debt relief. Secondly, they must establish\nrules to organize international trade on a more just and\nequitable basis. Thirdly, they must implement the\nrecommendations of the report of the World\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.\nLet us see to it that, in September 2005, as we convene\nthe United Nations high-level event on the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, relevant consideration and\nconcrete actions will already have been undertaken to\nthat end.\nFor the francophone community, the themes of\nsolidarity and sustainable development will be\nconsidered at the tenth conference of heads of State\nand Government, to be held in November in Burkina\nFaso.\nWe believe that the economic and social well-\nbeing to which our peoples aspire can be achieved\nwithin the framework of the rule of law. For its part,\nBurkina Faso has resolutely opted for democracy, and\nour determination has been fortified through free and\nopen electoral consultations for some 12 years now. We\nare fully resolved to embed democracy in our\ninstitutions and in our society, convinced as we are that\nit represents one path of hope for our country.\nThe United Nations must serve as a guide in the\nmanagement of international affairs. If it is to play that\nrole successfully and accomplish its task, it needs to be\ndeeply democratized. In other words, it must listen to\nthe majority of States and civil society organizations so\nas better to serve the common interest.\nAll signs point to the urgent need to reform the\nUnited Nations reform and to adapt it better than ever\nto the legitimate aspirations of nations. Every State,\nsmall or large, must assume its responsibility and be\naccountable for decisions taken for the common good.\nToday, were the Security Council to grow\ndemocratically and equitably in its representation of\nAfrica, Latin America and a large portion of Asia and\nEurope, it would enjoy greater political and moral\n9\n\nresources to meet the challenges of peace and\ndevelopment throughout the world.\nWithin the new United Nations that we so\nsincerely desire, the situation of the Republic of China\non Taiwan will finally be resolved fairly and\nacceptably. Reason dictates that that country, which\ncooperates with a large part of the international\ncommunity and makes a valuable contribution to\nuniversal civilization, should be rapidly integrated into\nthe United Nations.\nWith the valuable assistance of the Secretary-\nGeneral, we have laid the foundations of a vast\nprogramme to reform our Organization. This\nconstruction must produce an edifice sufficiently solid\nto meet the countless challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people\nof Costa Rica, may I convey to you, Mr. President, our\nwarmest congratulations and best wishes on your\nassumption of the important post of President.\nThe nineteenth century was, for vast sectors of\nmankind, the century of freedom. However, in many\nregions of the world, there were and continue to be,\nunacceptable levels of repression. The twentieth\ncentury was, for a good number of nations, the century\nof economic development. Nonetheless, the end of the\ntwentieth century witnessed a prevalence of poverty,\noppressive hunger and injustice, that have conspired\ntogether against aspirations for peace, security and\njustice.\nThe twenty-first century should be devoted to\nmaking freedom universal and consolidating economic\ndevelopment, but above all, to creating an opportunity\nfor social justice, international cooperation, equitable\nrelations among nations and the eradication of poverty.\nSince the beginning of my administration and in\nkeeping with that idea, I have advocated a\nglobalization that is tempered by justice and focused\non fulfilling the basic needs of all human beings and\ntheir right to happiness.\nAt my inauguration in May 2002, I noted that just\na few years earlier, when I began to speak of the need\nto globalize justice and to humanize globalization,\nsome skeptics considered me a lonely voice crying out\nin a desert of fierce competition. Today we are many\nmore and our voice is much more powerful in\ndemanding that the process of globalization be made\nmore humane.\nI am therefore very encouraged today by the fact\nthat world opinion shares the same concerns which are\nreflected in the recommendations of the ILO report\nentitled \u201cA fair globalization: Creating opportunities\nfor all\u201d. That report correctly states: \u201cWe believe the\ndominant perspective on globalization must shift more\nfrom a narrow preoccupation with markets to a broader\npreoccupation with people.\u201d (Preface, p. vii)\nAs greater integration develops between peoples\nand economies, it is urgent that we incorporate\nelements of a humanistic ethic into the globalization\nprocess, as an opportunity to spread the benefits of\neconomic development and scientific and technological\nprogress. These significant developments, the product\nof human wisdom and intelligence, are and must be\nenjoyed by all as part of the patrimony of all mankind.\nToday, this Organization unites 191 States with\ndifferent identities and diverse histories, but with\nfutures and presents that grow more interdependent\nwith every passing day. In international forums, it has\nbecome commonplace to speak of the need to\nformulate inclusive national models of development. I\nbelieve that it is high time to speak of an inclusive\nglobal society. This General Assembly, which\nrepresents and expresses the common will of all\n25\n\nmankind, must play a central role in promoting a\nmarkedly humane globalization.\nEconomic development is a force that must be\ndirected and guided. The economy\u2019s positive and\npowerful forces should not be left to the invisible hand\ndetermined, in most cases, by the obvious inequality\namong nations. In that regard, it is necessary to\nconsider some concerning data regarding the global\neconomy. The rate of growth of the global gross\ndomestic product decreased progressively from an\naverage of 3.6 per cent in the 1960s to an average of a\n1.1 per cent in the 1990s. If we compare the per capita\ngross domestic products in constant dollars of the 20\npoorest countries and the 20 richest, we note that,\nbetween 1960 and 1962, the former were almost 54\ntimes poorer than the latter, while four decades later, in\nthe period 2000-2002, they were 121 times poorer. The\ndifferences have been accentuated and the gap has\nbroadened. These results show an inverse relationship\nto what we should be looking for if we really seek a\npeaceful, stable and fair world.\nIn light of those realities, and in order to enable\nthe 1.2 billion poorest people in the world to\nparticipate in the benefits of economic development,\nwe must promote policies and strategies that create\nopportunities for all. To that end, it is necessary to\nmake progress at the international level in the\nfollowing two directions. First, we must agree on and\nstrengthen rules and policies that provide a fair\nnormative framework for globalization. Secondly, we\nshould create or broaden the venues for the effective\ninternational negotiation, management and\nimplementation of those agreements.\nPoverty, the lack of opportunities, deficient\nmedical services and limited access to education,\nfrequently accompanied by excessive expenditure in\narmaments, cause the suffering of most peoples. It is\nnoteworthy that, in 2003, the world set a new record by\ndevoting $956 billion to military expenditure. That\nrepresents a 17-fold increase in the amount of\nresources devoted worldwide to official development\nassistance and more than the sum of the foreign debt of\nthe 64 countries with the lowest gross domestic\nproduct. Those numbers demonstrate that mankind has\nyet to understand that security results not from\nmultiplying weapons, but from multiplying loaves of\nbread. Peace and security are built, above all, by\ncombating injustice, satisfying basic needs, striving for\ncommon social goals and establishing fair and honest\nGovernment.\nAs pointedly noted by Mr. Oscar Arias S\u00e1nchez,\nformer President of Costa Rica and Nobel Peace Prize\nlaureate,\n\u201cthe billions of dollars spent every year on\nweapons and on military contingents deprive the\nworld\u2019s poorest peoples of the chance to fulfil\ntheir basic needs\u201d.\nIn that regard, Costa Rica fully supports the draft\nframework convention on international arms transfers.\nThat project, based on the obligations already\nundertaken by States, seeks to regulate the export of\nweapons and their marking and tracing in order to\nprevent arms transfers to terrorist and rebel groups and\nto those States that breach international humanitarian\nlaw or basic human rights principles. I respectfully\nurge all United Nations Member States to adopt that\ninstrument of international law. I am convinced that it\nwill contribute substantially to our struggle against the\nillicit traffic of weapons around the world.\nThe aphorism that \u201cthe security of one is\ninseparable from the security of all\u201d is growing truer\nevery day. Global democratic governance requires\nstrengthening both the United Nations and the\ncompetences of the General Assembly. Every State\nMember must have a voice and every people of the\nworld must be represented, in conformity with the\nprinciples of equality and universality that govern the\nUnited Nations system. The Security Council must be\nreformed by enlarging its membership and making it\nmore democratic.\nThe maintenance of prerogatives for some States,\nto the detriment of the great majority of States\nMembers, is not only antidemocratic, but contrary to\nthe principle of sovereign equality among States\nenshrined in the San Francisco Charter itself.\nCommitted to the principles of universality and\ndemocracy on which the United Nations is based, I\nrenew Costa Rica\u2019s longstanding call for the admission\nto the United Nations, in conditions of full legal\nequality, of the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose\nGovernment has often reiterated its willingness to\nassume the obligations imposed by the Charter.\nAllow me to refer to one of the worst scourges\naffecting peaceful relations among the nations: the\nthreat of terrorism. The grave attacks committed all\n26\n\nover the world over the past few years \u2014 in particular,\nthose committed in New York, Madrid and\nBeslan \u2014 prove how far terrorists are prepared to go.\nCosta Rica is fervently committed to the culture of life\nand, in consequence, our people and Government\ncondemn all acts of terrorism.\nEven the loftiest ideals from the most legitimate\nsources become mere excuses and pretexts when they\nare taken over by terrorists. The first victims of the\nterrorists are the causes that they claim to defend.\nInternational society must firmly and resolutely\nconfront all acts of terrorism, the painful and deadly\nconsequences of which touch so many nations and\ninnocent victims. It is essential to combat all forms of\nterrorism as well as its sources of financing and safe\nhavens. It is equally essential to combat with the same\nresolve the poverty, inequality and hunger \u2014 both for\nfood and for justice \u2014 that afflict many peoples.\nThe coordination of the international struggle\nagainst terrorism must be assigned to an independent,\nprofessional and permanent organ located at the centre\nof this Organization. For that reason, we propose the\ncreation of the post of United Nations high\ncommissioner on terrorism that would assist the\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the\nEconomic and Social Council in the comprehensive\nfight against that threat and its causes. Only by\ncreating such an organ, which would draw together\nresources and multiply efforts, will it be possible to\nrespond adequately and jointly to the challenge posed\nby international terrorism.\nToday, global democratic governance has two\nfundamental pillars: the International Court of Justice\nand the International Criminal Court. The International\nCourt of Justice, whose obligatory jurisdiction Costa\nRica accepts without reservation, provides us with an\nimpartial instance for the peaceful solution of\ncontroversies within the framework of the rule of law,\nthus avoiding haphazard or arbitrary interpretations of\nthe legal norms.\nNevertheless, we note with concern that very few\nStates accept the obligatory jurisdiction of the Court\nwithout conditions. Most States have made reservations\nthat exclude, in some cases, all the possible or even all\nthe conceivable situations in which they would have to\nsubmit to the authority of the principal judicial organ\nof the United Nations.\nThe International Criminal Court, whose\nestablishment Costa Rica supported enthusiastically,\nprovides us with an impartial organ to judge the most\nserious crimes against mankind. Ironically, while we\nall repudiate those crimes, only 94 States have ratified\nthe Rome Statute and accepted the competence of the\nCourt.\nI would also like to refer to the need to globalize\ncriminal justice in order to prosecute those who, taking\nadvantage of public office, rob their own peoples. How\nmany generations will be condemned to pay the odious\ndebts created by leaders irremediably sick of greed?\nWe must never forget that corruption is the mother of\npoverty because it deprives the poorest peoples of the\nworld of the resources necessary to finance their\neducation, health, housing and social security.\nMr. Verbeke (Belgium), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nIt is time to give justice its rightful place. There\nshould be no loopholes. Asylum and protection should\nnot be given to those who ransack their own peoples.\nAll safe havens of impunity must disappear.\nAs we have a duty to protect the oppressed and\npersecuted, we also have a duty to protect those who\ndo not yet have a voice. In particular, there is a\npressing need to agree on a normative framework,\ninternationally binding, to uphold human dignity from\nthe moment of conception. It necessarily follows,\ntherefore, that to defend life is to defend the very\nessence of man itself, all the promises, joys and hopes\nof the human being.\nI believe in science within ethical limits. As a\nmedical doctor, I reject human cloning, while I firmly\nsupport research on adult stem cells, which does not\npresent the same ethical and legal problems as does\ncloning. I invite you all to join us in our efforts to\nadopt an international convention to ban all forms of\nhuman cloning.\nWe owe a great debt to nature. It is time to ensure\nthat globalization be sustainable from an ecological\npoint of view, in order to maintain the viability of\nhuman life on planet Earth. Notwithstanding the\ncommitment of 120 nations, we have been unable to\nobtain the necessary support for the entry into force of\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\nIn 2001, the High-Level Panel on Financing for\nDevelopment proposed that the various international\n27\n\nentities on environment be consolidated into a single\norganization with a standing similar to that of the\nWorld Trade Organization or the International\nMonetary Fund. Regrettably, this proposal, as well as\nsimilar initiatives, has not yet enjoyed the necessary\nconsensus for its approval. Undoubtedly, something\nmust be done soon in this regard.\nWe live in a globalized world. This is the logical\noutcome of the natural evolution of things and the\nprogress of mankind, especially in the areas of\ntelecommunication and information technology. This\nfact has brought nations closely together and, at the\nsame time, it has created unavoidable multilateral\nresponsibilities.\nToday, we live in a world that tries to follow not\nonly the rules of the global market but also democratic\nprinciples, one that tries to uphold higher standards\nregarding the observance of human rights, while\nrejecting all forms of odious discrimination and\nshowing concern for the environment. The observance\nof these minimum standards, adopted by the\ninternational society itself, should be the rule for\nmeasuring each State.\nCosta Rica would like to see the following\nprinciples recognized and practised by the whole\ninternational community: greater respect for human\nrights and labour guarantees, greater protection for the\nenvironment and greater social investment in exchange\nfor less military expenditure. States should have\ngreater opportunities to access international\ncooperation, credit and markets, while prices should be\nfair, reflecting real costs. It is not fair that poor\ncountries, such as Costa Rica, which are making efforts\nin the areas of disarmament, respect for human\nrights, labour justice, protection of the environment,\nand greater social investment, be penalized by\nexcluding them from the lists of beneficiaries of\ncooperation programmes and from systems of\npreferential treatment for the access of their products\nto the markets of developed countries.\nIf we desire lasting peace and a secure world, we\nshould give a humane dimension to relations among\nthe various nations. Let us undertake together the\nchallenge to overcome poverty, hunger, malnutrition\nand injustice, as we committed ourselves to do just\nyesterday, in the meeting convened by the President of\nBrazil, His Excellency Mr. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nLet us make this task the centre of the international\nagenda for the short term. A better world is possible. It\nis in our hands to build it."

        "file_text": "I would like, on\nbehalf of Bulgaria, to offer my sincere congratulations\nto Mr. Jean Ping on his assumption of the presidency\n\u00f3 a position of great responsibility. Given his great\nexperience in multilateral diplomacy, I sure that he will\nlead the deliberations of the fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly to a successful outcome. I would\n47\n\nalso like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nwork done by his predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, to\nreform and revitalize the Assembly.\n(spoke in English)\nThis is the first year that the Republic of Bulgaria\nhas taken part in the deliberations of the General\nAssembly as a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization and as a State which has successfully\nconcluded its negotiations on joining the European\nUnion. We are fully aware of the great responsibility\nwhich we bear this year in discharging our mandate as\nthe Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. All those factors\nencourage Bulgaria to redouble its efforts in support of\nthe United Nations. We shall continue our efforts\naimed at strengthening the authority and role of the\nUnited Nations. We shall support the constructive\nproposals for reforms within the United Nations, which\nshould enhance its capacity and effectiveness.\nToday the United Nations faces new challenges,\nwhich require resolute joint action and coordination.\nThe United Nations and its bodies, as well as the\nspecialized institutions within its system, will continue\nto make an important contribution aimed at dealing\nwith extreme poverty and hunger, achieving\nsustainable development, containing and eliminating\nviolence and human rights abuses and affirming the\nrule of law, good governance and democratic values.\nInternational terrorism poses the most serious\nthreat to international peace and security. This requires\ncoordinated and resolute action by all States and the\nentire international community. Nothing can justify\nterrorist acts. It is essential that terrorists do not get\nhold of weapons of mass destruction nor distract us\nfrom our agenda, as outlined by the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nThis month the world remembers the victims of\nthe terrorist acts of 11 September, marking the\nanniversary of those tragic events. We all watched in\nhorror, anguish and anger the cold-blooded massacre of\ninnocent children and their parents in the school in\nBeslan. That is terrorism at its ugliest.\nBulgaria, too, is firmly convinced that\ninternational terrorism threatens all States and that it\ncan be dealt with only through joint efforts. It is for\nthat reason that the people and the Government of\nBulgaria have whole-heartedly supported our country\u00eds\nactive participation in the global coalition against\nterrorism. We are committed to pursuing that policy\nsteadfastly, even though we have suffered human\nlosses and sustained damage.\nWithin the United Nations system, the Security\nCouncil and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)\nare vested with the task of ensuring success in the fight\nagainst international terrorism. We share the view that\nSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and the\ncreation of the new Counter-Terrorism Committee\nExecutive Directorate have improved coordination in\nthis field. The Al Qaeda and Taliban Committee,\nbeefed up in 2004 with the Monitoring Group and\nSanctions Enforcement Support Team, should also\ncontinue to wield its positive influence.\nWithin the framework of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Bulgaria\nhas been assisting in the joint initiatives of the CTC\nand OSCE and of the United Nations Office for Drug\nControl and Crime Prevention.\nThe OSCE has been involved in several countries\nin south-east Europe for many years now, and its\ncommitment to fostering peace and stability in the\nregion, through its field missions in Macedonia;\nCroatia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Albania; Serbia and\nMontenegro; and Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, has\nproved invaluable. Through activities such as\ninstitution- and capacity-building, promoting and\nsupporting legislative reform, respect for human rights,\nand - in cooperation with the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\nand other international actors - the repatriation of\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, the OSCE\nhas made clear its comparative advantage in the region.\nBut, while this work is essential, it cannot be done\neffectively without enhanced efforts by the international\ncommunity to address the region\u00eds lagging infrastructure.\nThe development of infrastructure and political\nstability must go hand in hand. The people of the\nregion are isolated from each other and from the rest of\nthe region. Indeed, it can take longer to fly from Sofia to\nTirana than to cross the Atlantic. There is a desperate\nneed for highways, railways and infrastructure\ncorridors to bring the people of the region closer\ntogether. Bulgaria knows from experience the\nimportance for the people of south-eastern Europe of\nhaving the prospect of full integration into mainstream\nEuropean political and economic structures.\n48\n\nSustained efforts must be made by the\ninternational community to stimulate economic growth\nin that region and to offer young people in particular\ntangible hope for the future.\nBulgaria has always regarded the stability and\nsecurity of south-east Europe as one of its priorities.\nYet, in spite of the positive changes and the\nacceleration of the European and Euro-Atlantic\nintegration of the States in the region, the events that\ntook place in Kosovo last March revealed that serious\nrisks and latent threats still exist. Bulgaria supports the\nemergence of a democratic, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural\nand multi-religious society in Kosovo. We will\ncontinue to cooperate actively with the United Nations\nMission in Kosovo so that this aim can finally be\nattained.\nBulgaria is in favour of the full implementation\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and its\n\u00ecstandards before status\u00ee policy. An agreement on\nthose standards, together with the forthcoming\nnegotiating process, will be decisive for Kosovo\u00eds\nfuture. We welcome the Secretary-General\u00eds initiatives,\nand in particular the comprehensive review of the\npolitical situation in Kosovo prepared by Ambassador\nKai Eide. We will continue to lend our active support\nto Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, the Secretary-General\u00eds\nnewly appointed Special Representative. We hope that\nthe elections next month will prove to be an important\nstep forward in the context of the social and political\nprocesses under way and towards reaching a durable\nsolution to the Kosovo problem.\nBulgaria is firmly convinced that the United\nNations must play a key role in the stabilization and\nrestoration of Iraq, in the ongoing political and\nconstitutional process, based on Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004), and in the preparations for\ndemocratic and free elections. We welcome the first\nsteps taken in Baghdad by Mr. Ashraf Qazi, the\nSecretary-General's Special Representative, as well as\nthe mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission\nfor Iraq (UNAMI).\nThere have been encouraging developments in\nthe resolution of conflicts in certain hot spots in the\nworld, such as Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste. At the\nsame time, there are complicated situations in other\nregions, particularly in Africa. The situation in Darfur\nis of serious concern. Security Council resolution 1556\n(2004) and the recently adopted resolution 1564 (2004)\nmust be complied with in order to avoid a repetition of\nthe tragedy in other parts of the African continent, similar\nto the events that occurred during the last decade.\nDuring Bulgaria\u00eds chairmanship of the OSCE, we\nhave been making concerted efforts to spur and further\ndevelop cooperation between the United Nations and\nthe OSCE. We have been encouraged by the Secretary-\nGeneral\u00eds specific initiatives, aimed at improving the\nsynchronization of actions, communication and\nexchange of information with regional organizations.\nWe give very high marks to United Nations-OSCE\ncooperation in the western Balkans, the region of the\nCaucasus and in Central Asia.\nContemporary geopolitical realities require not\nonly cooperation between the United Nations and the\nOSCE, but also cooperation with the European Union,\nNATO, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States and relevant international agencies.\nIn my view, closer interaction between them is of\ncrucial importance to security, stability, democratic\nprosperity and tolerance throughout the world.\nThe developments in Georgia have been followed\nwith close attention by the Bulgarian OSCE\nchairmanship. We have also been actively involved in\nefforts to avert possible crisis situations in the\nautonomous region of Ajaria. We note with satisfaction\nthe encouraging changes that have taken place in\nAzerbaijan and Tajikistan, including the decision of the\nPresident of Azerbaijan, announced in March, to\nrelease 129 prisoners, as well as the June decision by\nthe President and the Parliament of Tajikistan to\nimpose a moratorium on the death penalty.\nThe OSCE, through its outreach activities,\nattaches great importance to assisting the normalization\nof Afghanistan and its steady progress towards\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. We express\nour satisfaction at the fact that the OSCE will\ncontribute to the monitoring of elections in\nAfghanistan.\nIn adapting ourselves to current geopolitical\nrealities, we envisage building a bridge of confidence\nover the Black Sea - an endeavour which can lay the\ngroundwork for future security, cooperation and\ntolerance in Europe, in Asia and the rest of the world.\nWe are deeply convinced that the Black Sea dialogue is\nof special importance not only for participating nations\nbut also because it can set a positive example for other\nparts of the world.\n49\n\nRespect for and observance of internationally\nrecognized standards of human rights by Member\nStates is a prerequisite both for their national security\nand for sustainable development. It is also a\nprerequisite for international peace and security. The\nprotection of basic human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms worldwide is a priority in the policy of the\nBulgarian Government. Our historical experience\nteaches us that, in the quest to achieve prosperity and\nsecurity in any society, it is necessary to have not only\nan adequate legal system and mechanisms for its\neffective implementation, but also a spirit of tolerance.\nWe must not tolerate only one minority and ignore the\nothers. Anti-Semitism, anti-Islamism, anti-Arabism,\nanti-Europeanism, anti-Americanism and even anti-\nglobalism ought to be equally and totally rejected.\nBulgaria welcomes the progressive reintegration\nof Libya into the international community. However, my\ncountry believes that a compelling message from the\nLibyan authorities about their respect for human rights\nand human values could only be communicated through a\njust solution to the well-known case of the medical\nworkers - six Bulgarians and one Palestinian - who\nhave been held behind bars in Tripoli and Benghazi for\nalmost six years. In this regard, we call upon the\nUnited Nations to redouble its efforts in the fight\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, which we\nbelieve is the cause of these tragic developments\nconcerning these seven innocent people.\nBulgaria regards issues concerning women,\nchildren and persons belonging to vulnerable groups of\nthe population, including elderly and disabled persons,\nas inseparable parts of the entire complex of human\nrights. The Bulgarian Government fully supports the\nstrict implementation of the documents of the World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, the twenty-\nseventh special session of the General Assembly on\nchildren, the World Assembly on Ageing, as well as the\nongoing efforts of the international community to draft\nand adopt a convention on the protection of the rights\nand dignity of disabled persons.\nThe measures aimed at revitalizing all the\nactivities of the United Nations are of extraordinary\nimportance for the current session of the General\nAssembly. The effectiveness of the work of United\nNations bodies, particularly the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social\nCouncil, is fundamental for solidifying the all-around\nrole of this world Organization. The sooner we do it,\nthe better, and all the more so since next year we will\nbe celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the United\nNations. Let us hope that we will at that time be able to\ncongratulate ourselves on the adoption of these badly\nneeded reforms. Taking all this into consideration and\nacting on the basis of the political will of all Member\nStates, as declared at the Millennium Summit, we give\nour support to the common efforts for speeding up\nUnited Nations reform and for strengthening the ties and\ncoordination among the United Nations, the Bretton\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.\nThe United Nations plays a principal and pivotal\nrole in the Republic of Bulgaria\u00eds foreign policy, as\nstated at the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly by our Prime Minister, Mr. Simeon Saxe-\nCoburg-Gotha. To this end, we shall continue our\nefforts to promote the role of the United Nations and\nenhance its efficiency and organizational structure in\norder to promote peace, development, democracy and\nthe rule of law."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I\noffer my congratulations and those of my country on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session.\nEighteen months ago, the United Nations faced\ndivisions more serious than any since the Cuban\nmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether\nthe strength and unity which we had built up since the\nend of the cold war could survive.\nThen last year we watched, as Secretary-General\nKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.\nIn the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided\nto follow our Secretary-General\u00eds directions. This\nOrganization has not been plunged, as some predicted,\ninto paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if\nunspoken determination to make the United Nations\nwork, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central\ntask: to secure peace around the world.\nOver the last 12 months we have dealt with new\ncrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we\nhave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government\nand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great\nLakes; mobilized international support for the new\nIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important\nsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they should\nin the media \u00f3 Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste,\nBougainville and Western Sahara.\nWe have shown in those actions the unity of\npurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our\nhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.\nAnd the search for consensus has not been confined to\nthe Security Council.\nI am proud that just a few months after the\ndifficult times of early last year, France, Germany and\nthe United Kingdom came together to work, as we\ncontinue to do, on the Iran dossier before the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\nI recognize, of course, the frustrations which all\nof us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict,\nwhere the clear path to peace set out in the road map\nand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.\nBut all in all we have shown the will to make collective\naction work, though we know, too, that we need to go\nfurther.\nIn particular, we need to get better at tackling\nthreats which have changed dramatically since the\nfounding of the United Nations. Today the greatest\nthreats to our security often come not from other\nfunctioning sovereign States, but from terrorist\norganizations, from failing States and from man-made\nshocks to our environment like climate change, which\ncan exacerbate State failure and breed internal\ninstability.\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General is\npreparing its recommendations on ways to address the\nvarious challenges. We should remember in all this that\nwe have one great advantage. Though its institutions\nand the founding text of the Charter has hardly\nchanged in 60 years, the United Nations is not an\norganization set in stone, but a set of living institutions\nbased on a shared will to make collective security\nwork. The United Nations has adapted in the past -\nwith the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus\non individual rights and the setting of global targets for\n34\n\ndevelopment - and I am confident that it can adapt in\nthe future.\nOf course, institutional change is part of that. At\nthe United Nations foundation, one eighth of its\nmembers could expect to be elected members of the\nSecurity Council at any one time. Today that\nproportion is less than one eighteenth. The United\nKingdom has long supported the case for expanding\nthe Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for\nincluding amongst the permanent members: Germany\nand Japan, two countries which between them\ncontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United\nNations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire\nworld\u00eds population; and Brazil, which just missed\npermanent membership back in 1945.\nBut we should not see an expansion of the\nSecurity Council, or other institutional change, as a\npanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common\nunderstanding - the United Nations jurisprudence, if\nyou like - and its operational effectiveness so that we\ncan respond more quickly and more thoroughly to\ntoday\u00eds new threats.\nLet me highlight three areas which to me seem\nparticularly important: first, our approach must be\nbroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,\nincluding poverty, disease and environmental\ndegradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by\nexpanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we\nmust deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces\nus all and everything for which we stand.\nLet me now take these three points in turn. First,\nthere is the need for a broader approach which\naddresses the complex and interdependent nature of\nsecurity today. Here, we have to do more to meet the\nMillennium Development Goals and to promote\nsustainable development, especially in Africa. We\ncannot have security without development or\ndevelopment without security.\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his\nspeech this week, we have to do more to entrench the\nrule of law and justice, especially in States recovering\nfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work\non the Secretary-General\u00eds report during its Security\nCouncil presidency next month.\nWe could also use the United Nations better, to\nagree to monitor and help implement globally accepted\nnorms of good governance.\nAnd we need to act together quickly on climate\nchange, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our\nworld in terms of stability and security. We have to\nimplement Kyoto - and I greatly welcome what my\ncolleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on\nthat today - and agree to emission reductions beyond\n2012.\nMy second point is the need to build a new\nconsensus on the scope of collective action. We all\nrepresent independent, sovereign states. But even as we\nfounded the United Nations we recognized that\nsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nation\u00eds\ngovernment: there to be respected, not abused, from\neither without or within.\nThe Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse\nfrom without could be dealt with through the inherent\nright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the\nCharter. But it also said that an abuse from within\nwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealt\nwith by the Security Council, under the powers\nenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the\nCharter, and by the many conventions concluded\nwithin the United Nations framework, including, for\nexample, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer -\nwe all said - could or should the world turn away\nfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.\nBut we have not always lived up to those high\nexpectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia\nten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to\ndo so and to engage in situations of humanitarian\ncatastrophe or grave violations of international\nhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats\nto international peace and security.\nThe principle of non-interference has to be\nqualified by a duty to protect, especially where\nGovernments are failing in that duty.\nWe therefore need, for example, to be ready to\nsupport greater use by the Secretary-General of his\npowers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats\nto peace to the Security Council's attention. We have to\nact quickly in response, because prevention is far better\nthan cure. We should look to work more closely with\nregional organizations, as we are doing with the\nAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on\nthe criteria as to when the international community\nmight have to intervene with military force in extreme\ncircumstances. We must get better at engaging for the\nlong term in countries recovering from conflict,\n35\n\ncoordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed\npriorities.\nMy third point is the urgent need to combat\nglobal terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have\nlearned anything in the three years since 11 September\n2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate\nin its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,\nHindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion\nor any religion, and of every or no shade of political\nopinion, all have died through the terrorists\u00ed bullet or\nbomb.\nMy friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a\nmoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible,\nunspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that\ntook place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears;\nRussia\u00eds tears are the world\u00eds tears. We are all in the\nfight against terrorism together.\nToday in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to\nwhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the\nvictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts\nand condolences are with the Government and people\nof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims\nof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping\nIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.\nOne of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held\nhostage by terrorists who have already barbarically\nmurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts\nand prayers are with their families. We continue to do\nall we can to secure Mr. Bigley\u00eds release.\nI know - how could I forget - that opinions\nhave differed over the rightness of the military action\ntaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no\nnation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now\noccurring there. For we all recognize that what is being\nattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on\nthe Iraqi people and on everything for which the\nOrganization stands: safety, security and human rights.\nWe have to come together to defeat the terrorists and\ntheir despicable aims.\nThe threat of terrorism confronts democratic,\nproperly functioning States with an acute dilemma,\nnamely, how to fight those who recognize none of the\nvalues for which we stand while remaining true to\nthose values. Our commitments under international\nconventions express many of those values and the\nimportance that we attach to them. But equally, those\nconventions cannot be allowed to shelter those\ninvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designed\nto protect citizens from abuse by States, not by\nterrorists.\nThe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\nRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear of\npersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so\nmany other nations have offered that protection when and\nwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Convention\nitself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does\nnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a\ncrime against humanity or other serious crime; nor\ndoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nWe must never stoop to the level of the terrorist \u00f3\nto torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration \u00f3\nnor will any country within the European Union be\nparty to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor\nto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists\nexploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not\nthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall\ntherefore be working closely with Russia on its\nimportant draft Security Council resolution, to see how\nbest we can prevent those who commit, support and\nfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee\nstatus to which they are not entitled. Along with the\nRussian Federation and other partners in the Security\nCouncil, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the\nspeedier extradition of such individuals.\nWe, the United Nations, have over the last year\nbegun to show a new determination to come together\nand to make collective action work. A year from now,\nwe will meet again here to review the\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, as well as the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, and to set the United Nations\nagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdom\u00eds\nchairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on\ntackling climate change and on Africa, on which the\nIndependent Commission for Africa will be producing\nrecommendations as to how best we can support the\nradical agenda for change and development designed\nby Africa itself through the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u00eds Development and the African Union. Our\npresidency of the European Union will help us to lead\nefforts for a successful outcome in the Doha\nDevelopment Round, and for building the European\nUnion\u00eds crisis-management capabilities.\nMore than ever, global security is our shared\nresponsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to\n36\n\nadapt to today\u00eds threats and challenges, we must find\nrenewed determination and political will to make\ncollective security work. The United Kingdom is\ndetermined to play its full part in that endeavour."

        "file_text": "Thirty years ago, my country attained its\nnational sovereignty. Indeed, it was on 17 September\n1974 that the young Republic of Guinea-Bissau was\nadmitted to the United Nations as a full-fledged\nMember State. Three decades, to be sure, is a short\ntime in terms of nation-building. But it is a long time if\nyou consider that in most African countries, including\nmy own, life expectancy does not exceed 50 years.\nThat bitter reality is the true measure of the time that\nhas elapsed and of what my country has achieved since\nindependence. Hence, for us in Guinea-Bissau, this is\nan important time for reflection, indeed for\nintrospection, in the light of recent events and of the\nsuccessive crises we have confronted of late.\nI address the Assembly today as the transitional\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\nAddressing the Assembly gives me particular pleasure,\nSir, because you - Mr. Jean Ping, the outstanding\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nthe brotherly and friendly Gabonese Republic - are\npresiding over the Assembly's work with the skill,\nexperience and talent we all know so well.\nWe have come to New York in search of new\nideas for innovative and resolute action, ideas that will\naffect the way we think and will have a positive impact\non our joint efforts to create a new world of peace,\nfreedom and social justice for all countries and peoples\nrepresented here.\nIt was with great attention and interest that we\nlistened to the outstanding statement made here two\ndays ago by Secretary-General Kofi Annan (see\n). His observations were thought-provoking.\nFor our part, we share his vision of the world as it is\ntoday and as it should be tomorrow. Above all, we\nappreciate his dedication and determination at the head\nof the Organization, whose irreplaceable role is\nincreasingly evident throughout the world.\nWe live today in a world of ever more striking\ncontrasts, imbalances, contradictions and inequalities.\nOn the one hand, we are witness to increasingly\nmarvellous scientific and technological progress, from\nwhich certain countries benefit greatly. On the other\n2\n\nhand, hundreds of millions of people continue to live\nprecarious lives and to suffer from malnutrition and\nendemic disease. This situation is not only inhuman\nand immoral, it is dangerous. It is sowing all the seeds\nthat provoke frustration and despair, fuel rancour and\nhatred and lead to irrational behaviour and to actions\nendangering peace and international security.\nCombating poverty and epidemics such as\nHIV/AIDS throughout the world does not mean kindness\nor charity; it is common sense that requires that together\nwe mobilize our actions to combat those scourges. I am\ngratified by the initiative of certain heads of State \u00f3 in\nparticular, President Lula da Silva - in recalling to\neach of us our responsibilities in the fight to eradicate\nhunger and destitution in a world as interdependent as\nthe one in which we live today. It is critical here to\nunderstand that there is an urgent need to act, and to\nact properly. Above all, let us not wait for more reports\nor analyses to be submitted to us first, regardless of\nhow visionary or relevant they may be. Thousands of\nwomen, children and infants die every day because\nthey lack a pill or a vaccination. That is unjust; that is\nimmoral.\nWe must pool our efforts to establish more\nequitable relations among States. International trade\nmust be better regulated, just as globalization and its\neffects on the world economy must be better\ncontrolled, to allow for a more equitable distribution of\nthe riches of the world. Rather than leaving the\nunderdeveloped countries to suffer from the effects of\nglobalization, let us create for them the conditions\nnecessary for their integration into the process, which\nis utterly beyond their control and whose social\ndimension must be the subject of specific measures so\nas to mitigate negative consequences.\nToday it is clear to everyone that to ensure peace\nthroughout the world there is a need to promote the\ndevelopment of the poorest countries and to improve\nthe living conditions of populations, in particular by\nguaranteeing them access to drinking water, health and\neducation - especially for girls. Above all there is a\nneed to create a social and political environment that is\nstable and is likely to release that creative energy of\neach and every individual and to promote the\nparticipation of all citizens in the management of the\naffairs of State of their country.\nThe rights of each and every person must be\nrespected, and all liberties provided by the law must be\nguaranteed without any impediment. The rule of law\nmust be consolidated to allow each institution to\nfunction properly and effectively. I am thinking in\nparticular of justice, which must be able to act with full\nindependence and with scrupulous respect for the\nseparation of executive, legislative and judicial powers.\nGuinea-Bissau, unfortunately, has not escaped\nfrom the cycle of violence and political crisis that\nseems today to have become a prerogative of the\nAfrican countries. Our country has recently suffered\nfrom the disastrous consequences of an economic\npolicy that is poorly adapted to the real needs of the\npopulation. The domestic conflict we have been\nexperiencing in Guinea-Bissau since 1998 could have\nbeen avoided. It has further impoverished a country\nthat is among the least developed countries and where\neverything must still be built because nothing could\nresist destruction. We are aware of the seriousness of\nthe situation and of the need to pool our efforts to make\nthe necessary changes, which our people have a right to\nexpect from their leaders.\nOur people have suffered too much and for too\nlong and have made too many sacrifices. We must\ncreate new conditions that provide reasons for hope.\nWe have successfully initiated national dialogue based\non mutual respect and taking into account the national\ninterest. We have created a new culture of peace based\non our affiliation with one single country with all its\ndiversity and social and cultural riches. We have\ndecided to make democracy an immutable reality.\nHowever, we are aware that democracy is not\neasy to build in a poor country where the illiteracy rate\nis still high and where the fundamental infrastructure is\nstill severely lacking. Nevertheless, we continue to be\ninspired by the courage of our people and by the\nsupport of other countries \u00f3 those of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the\nUnion \u2026conomique et Mon\u00c8taire Ouest-africaine\n(UEMOA) and the Community of Portuguese-speaking\nCountries in particular \u00f3 and the European Union,\nChina and the rest of the international community.\nThus last March we were able to organize legislative\nelections that the international community considered\njust and credible and to establish a new parliament, the\nrole of which is fundamental in any democracy. We\nwill also be organizing presidential elections in April\n2005, as agreed in the Charter of Transition, thus\nallowing for the restoration of constitutional order.\n3\n\nGuinea-Bissau needs the assistance of the\ninternational community to meet the many enormous\nchallenges confronting it. That assistance is urgent and\nimportant. We have created mechanisms for the\nrigorous control of State revenues and expenditures\nand, with the assistance of the UNDP and the Bretton\nWoods institutions in particular, all the necessary\nconditions for the transparent management of public\nproperty, which allows us to combat corruption.\nTo enable us to relaunch our economy rapidly, we\nare planning to hold a round table in December. We\nhope that India, Brazil and South Africa will be\nassisting us in that initiative to combat poverty and\nhelping us in the organization we have created in our\ncountry.\nWe have here a great opportunity to express our\ngratitude for the commitment and dynamic action of\nthe Economic and Social Council\u00eds Ad Hoc Advisory\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau and its partners, an\nindispensable instrument for advancing constructive\ndialogue between Guinea-Bissau and its partners for\ndevelopment, including the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund. I should like to thank\nthem from this rostrum for their continued support. So,\ntoo, we wish to reaffirm our great appreciation for the\nmembers of the Security Council who visited our\ncountry last June and showed their great interest in it.\nFor the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity Guinea-Bissau, speaking before the great\nmajority of the Members of the Organization, hopes\nthat the Security Council\u00eds part will be strengthened by\nenhancing its membership to better reflect the world\nsituation. From this rostrum, I would like to say how\ngrateful we are to those who supported us in the first\nphase of our transition.\nHumanity is one and indivisible. The men and\nwomen who inhabit our planet share the same\naspirations: peace and well-being. Every individual,\nwhatever the continent he belongs to, feels the same\nfrustration when confronting injustice, impunity and\nviolations of the rights of the human being. There is\nnot a single child who does not feel the need to be\nloved and protected by his or her parents and who does\nnot hope to grow up in a home where peace and love\nreign. How can we protect them if nothing is done to\nguarantee the rights of women and give a suitable\neducation to young women? How can we prevent the\nmother, and the child she brings into the world,\nbecoming victims of an endemic illness such as AIDS,\ntuberculosis or malaria at a time when most poor\ncountries are incapable of providing basic health care?\nTomorrow\u00eds world is being built today. Thanks to\nthe awareness of the real challenges, in this planetary\nvillage in which we all live, with its advantages and its\nproblems, our human condition must be the common\ndenominator on which and around which all people of\ngood will should come together in order to make our\nworld more fair, more tolerant and based more on\nsolidarity.\nWhether we are discussing crises in Africa or in\nthe Middle East, or the fight against terrorism - a\nfight that requires us all to mobilize our efforts - we\nmust be animated by the same determination to seek\nlasting solutions based on consensus.\nThe peoples we represent expect us to take\nconcrete actions. They hope that we will be able to\novercome our differences and pool our efforts so as to\nrespond to their most urgent needs. Many praiseworthy\ninitiatives to eradicate hunger, poverty, malnutrition\nand illiteracy have been undertaken. We must involve\nnon-governmental organizations and other elements of\ncivil society. In other words, we must appeal to all\npeople of goodwill.\nThe nations of the world all share the planet\nEarth, on which we all live. It is our responsibility to\nprotect it so that we can provide our children and our\nchildren\u00eds children with the conditions for a healthy\nlife lived in dignity.\nEnvironmental protection alone is not enough.\nWe must also create a climate of peace throughout the\nworld. That cannot be done without the help of each\nMember State: it must be a collective effort in which\ndialogue and agreement take precedence and where the\nrule of law prevails in international relations. None of\nour peoples can live in isolation in the self-reliant\nmanner of the past. The interdependence of the global\neconomy is now a reality for all of us. Let us take\nadvantage of the resources of the Earth without\nabusing our ecosystems, because the future of the\nplanet depends on our capacity to think in terms of the\ncollective interest. Let us act in a spirit of humanism\nand solidarity whenever the poorest of the poor\nconfront calamity and natural disasters - disasters\nsuch as those that have recently afflicted Haiti, the\nDominican Republic and other Caribbean countries.\n4\n\nLet us understand the true dimension and\nmeaning of the spiritual force that resides in each\nhuman being - a force to which we can turn at times\nof doubt and discouragement in order to regain the will\nand the energy we need to overcome our challenges."

        "file_text": "I\nwould like to extend my warmest congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your election as the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. My\ndelegation wishes to assure you of its full support and\ncooperation during your tenure of office. I also express\nmy appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte,\nfor his leadership and tireless work over the past year.\nI also extend my appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan\nand his staff for their continuous hard work and\ncommitment. The Secretary-General\u2019s personal\ndedication and leadership in the work of the United\nNations, especially his efforts for global peace and\nstability, are an inspiration to us all. Those efforts are\nall the more necessary in the light of what many of us\nhere have described as disturbing world developments.\nOn behalf of the Government of Brunei\nDarussalam, I wish to extend our sympathy and\ncondolences to the Governments and the peoples of the\nUnited States and the Caribbean countries for the\ndevastation caused by the recent hurricanes.\nSince its establishment 59 years ago, the United\nNations has achieved much, especially in ensuring\ninternational peace and security and creating a stable\nand prosperous world. There has not been a world war\nsince its inception, and it has had a positive impact in\nmany fields, such as peacekeeping, the eradication of\nvarious diseases and socio-economic development. We\nhighly commend those efforts and value the sacrifices\nof those involved.\nHowever, the achievements of the United Nations\nhave been undermined by increasingly complex\ninternational developments. In his annual report on the\nwork of the Organization (A/59/1), the Secretary-\n7\n\nGeneral stated that the United Nations has been\nthrough an extraordinarily challenging year. It was the\nyear in which the Iraq war brought the debate on the\nUnited Nations role into sharper focus.\nMoreover, our Organization is still preoccupied\nwith many unresolved issues. Among others, the\nPalestinian conflict remains a grave concern. Terrorism\nand weapons of mass destruction continue to pose\nserious threats. At the same time, poverty,\nenvironmental degradation and the spread of disease\ncause further misery and hardship for millions. Those\nissues demand our effective response, which will\nultimately define the relevance of our Organization.\nWe therefore need more than ever a strong and\neffective United Nations, one that is able to promote\nworld peace and development. It must also give hope\nand purpose to the people who increasingly look to it\nto improve their lives.\nHowever, the United Nations cannot do all that\non its own. For it to carry out its responsibilities\neffectively, Member States need to work together,\ncontribute resources and honour their commitments. As\nwe work collectively to meet today\u2019s complex\nchallenges, we must continue to adhere to the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. All the various\nconventions and treaties, from nuclear non-\nproliferation to environmental conservation, are\nmanifestations of how we and the United Nations aim\nto protect our people and ensure that they can live to\ntheir fullest potential. In that regard, I wish to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his address to\nthe General Assembly, in which he emphasized the\nimportance of those issues. It is through our\nreaffirmation of the Charter\u2019s principles that we can\neffectively uphold human ideals, enhance security and\nstability and promote sustainable development.\nWithout doubt, the United Nations is the most\nuniversal international body for providing a\nmultilateral response. We need to reform the United\nNations urgently so that it can be better equipped. In\nthat regard, Brunei Darussalam fully supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts to strengthen and revitalize\nthe United Nations. In particular, we welcome the work\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange, which he has set up to address this.\nWe believe that United Nations reform should be\ncomprehensive and include an expanded and more\nrepresentative Security Council, a revitalized role for\nthe General Assembly and better coordination among\nUnited Nations agencies. The interest a number of\ncountries have shown in serving as permanent\nmembers of the Security Council is a clear indication\nof the desire for change.\nNext year, the Assembly will consider the report\nof the High-level Panel and the recommendations of\nthe Secretary-General. I realize how difficult it is to\nfind a solution that is acceptable to all, but it is\nincumbent upon Member States to make a difference\nby implementing the much-needed reforms. Thus, a\nwillingness to find a balanced set of proposals will be\nnecessary. We look forward to the report, which,\nhopefully, will make the necessary bold and realistic\nproposals in order to end the decade-long debate on\nthis issue.\nNext year will be a critical time for us as we\nreview implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. To ensure that the commitments\nset forth in the Millennium Declaration are\nimplemented on schedule, we must act without delay.\nAs for Brunei Darussalam, we are doing our part to\nachieve those goals.\nAs we begin to look into our agenda for this\nsession, we must remain focused on the issues\naffecting many innocent lives in Palestine. Recent\ndevelopments, such as the illegal construction of the\nwall in the occupied Palestinian territories, must be\nstopped and reversed. The advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice and the subsequent\nGeneral Assembly resolution ES-10/15 reflect the\ninternational community\u2019s overwhelming support for\nending injustice in the occupied territories.\nThe concerned parties must do all they can to\nprevent the situation from deteriorating. They must\nmake serious efforts to honour their obligations as\noutlined in the road map. It is critical that progress\nshould be made so that we can find a comprehensive,\njust and durable solution to that longstanding conflict.\nThe situation in other parts of the Middle East,\nsuch as Iraq, has created enormous anxiety. We\nacknowledge the central role of the United Nations and\nthe efforts of other countries and parties in addressing\nthe political and humanitarian dimensions of the\nproblems.\nIn our region, we recognize that the nuclear issue\non the Korean peninsula has a serious impact on the\npeace, stability and security of the Asian-Pacific\nregion. We appreciate the role of China, the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Japan, the\nRepublic of Korea, Russia and the United States in\n8\n\nseeking a solution through dialogue in the six-party\ntalks. It is important that all parties concerned continue\ntheir efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the issue.\nWe are deeply saddened by the horrifying scenes\nof harm inflicted upon innocent people by terrorist\nacts. Brunei Darussalam would like to convey its great\nsympathy to the Governments and the peoples of the\ncountries in Asia, the Middle East and Europe that\nhave been targeted by terrorist attacks in the past year.\nWe strongly condemn those atrocious acts.\nTerrorism affects all of us \u2014 women and men,\nadults and children, developed and developing\ncountries. It knows no boundaries. It has no ethnic,\nracial or religious affinities. Despite concerted efforts,\ndevastating incidents this year have heightened the\nthreats and challenges posed by terrorism. Those acts\nare becoming more complex, and our fight against\nthem is far from over. It is therefore important to\naddress this problem in a comprehensive manner. In\ndoing so, we need to identify this problem\u2019s real source\nand root causes. This is what we have to bear in mind\nif we are to achieve a long-term solution. At the same\ntime, we must not allow terrorists to divide us and\nundermine our determination to fight this menace\ncollectively.\nThe challenges that we face require us to move\nforward to ensure that the United Nations continues to\nplay its pivotal role. I am confident, Mr. President, that\nunder your able leadership, the General Assembly will\nachieve success and make the decisions necessary to\nfulfil the hopes and expectations of the peoples it\nrepresents. Our tasks are great, but so also are our\ncapabilities when we all work together."

        "file_text": "May I, as Prime\nMinister of Malaysia and in my capacity as Chairman\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and Chairman of the\ntenth Islamic Summit Conference, offer my sincere\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election\nas the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session. I am confident that with your wisdom,\nexperience and diplomatic skill, you will steer the\nproceedings of the Assembly to a successful\nconclusion. I assure you of Malaysia\u2019s fullest\ncooperation. I strongly believe that the member\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference would\nsimilarly render all their support and cooperation to\nyou.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to your\ndistinguished predecessor, the Honourable Julian\nRobert Hunte of Saint Lucia. He discharged his\nresponsibility with dedication and full commitment, in\nan efficient and effective manner. I commend\nespecially his leadership in moving forward the process\nof revitalization of the General Assembly.\nI wish to commend as well the Secretary-General\nand the Secretariat for their perseverance and relentless\nefforts in pursuit of the goals of the United Nations. In\nparticular, I congratulate the Secretary-General for his\ninitiatives to claim for the United Nations a more\ncentral role in the management of world affairs. I\nsalute also the dedicated men and women of the United\nNations who have sacrificed their lives in the service\nof humanity.\nWhen we met last year at the Assembly\u2019s fifty-\neighth session, we were deeply distressed that there\nwas so much gloom in the international situation as a\nresult of a breakdown in the multilateral negotiating\nprocesses. We were bitterly divided over the invasion\nof Iraq; there was great disappointment about the\ndeadlock in the World Trade Organization ministerial\nmeeting in Canc\u00fan, and we had to mourn the death of\ninternational civil servants who were killed during an\nact of terrorism against the United Nations\nheadquarters in Baghdad.\n2\n\nTherefore, I consider it our solemn obligation at\nthis fifty-ninth session to reaffirm the rightful role of\nthe United Nations in the management of critical issues\naffecting international peace and security, and commit\nourselves to abide by multilateralism in the quest for a\nmore just and equitable international order. We must\nalso take the necessary steps to ensure that never again\nshould the United Nations be sidelined.\nAs the General Assembly is the most\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations, we must\ndedicate ourselves to finding consensus on measures to\nrevitalize the Assembly to fulfil its mandate in\naccordance with the Charter. We must build upon the\nwork done in the fifty-eighth session. Again, we look\ntowards the leadership of the Assembly President in\nthat regard.\nIn that connection, the Malaysian delegation\nwishes to advocate that this fifty-ninth session of the\nAssembly accord high priority to ensuring that the\nUnited Nations regains its central role in social,\neconomic and development issues. The United\nNations \u2014 through an enhanced Economic and Social\nCouncil \u2014 should provide the impetus for the creation\nof an international economic system which better\npromotes the interests of developing countries. The\nUnited Nations must do more to realize all\ninternationally agreed targets, particularly the\nMillennium Development Goals. As the eradication of\npoverty and hunger is fundamental to the achievement\nof those Goals, Malaysia fully appreciates the Brazilian\ninitiative to create new and innovative forms of\nfunding to meet those challenges.\nWe look forward to receiving the report of the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\nappointed by the Secretary-General last year. We\nbelieve the Secretary-General will make his own\nrecommendations based on that report, and they should\nprovide the basis for in-depth discussion among\nMember States in the months leading up to the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations.\nThis world body, the processes of multilateralism\nand, indeed, the entire international system must\nnecessarily change. However, those changes must be\neffected without sacrificing certain immutable\nprinciples, such as sovereign equality, non-interference\nin the domestic affairs of States, peaceful settlement of\ndisputes and respect for international law. What we do\nin that respect during the fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly will therefore be crucial.\nReform of the United Nations is a cause\nparticularly dear to both the Non-Aligned Movement\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference. They\nlook forward to working closely with you,\nMr. President, as well as with other Members of the\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General on this\nmatter.\nMost immediately, we must find ways and means\nto let the United Nations assume its proper role in\ncombating international terrorism. Malaysia is\nconvinced that the fight against terrorism cannot\nsucceed through the force of arms alone. To win it, we\nneed to exert genuine efforts and demonstrate good\nfaith to address the root causes of terrorism, one of the\nmost obvious of which is the unfulfilled dreams of\npeoples struggling for independence and aspiring to\nsovereign States of their own. To find the answers, we\nmust promote genuine dialogue and rid ourselves of the\nprejudices and bigotry triggered by the events of\n11 September and further aggravated by subsequent\nevents. The United Nations is clearly the best forum\nfor such a dialogue to take place without malice, in a\nshared environment that is devoted to finding peace\namong nations and building friendship between\npeoples. The United Nations can facilitate the\nconvening of a special international conference to\nconsider the question in all its aspects, including the\nroot causes of terrorism and the issue of State-\nsponsored terrorism.\nOne of the most important aspects to be\naddressed by such a dialogue is the necessity to\ninculcate a frank appreciation, understanding and\nacceptance of different civilizations and cultures,\nincluding religions. There is an urgent need to stop\ntarnishing the Muslim world with unfair stereotypes.\nWe must cease associating Islam with violence,\npoverty and indignity. In reality, the troubles have\nnothing to do with Islam; nor are the problems\nexclusively associated with Muslims. We need to clear\nthe confusion that links the problems faced by some\nMuslim countries with the religion of Islam.\nWe also note with great concern the increasing\ntendency to link the fight against terrorism with the\ncampaign against the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Developing countries suffer as a result of\nrestrictions imposed on their access for peaceful uses\n3\n\nto the technology, equipment and material necessary\nfor their economic development. Malaysia is fully and\nfirmly committed to the cause of non-proliferation, but\nthere must be multilateral negotiations for universal,\ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements and\narrangements. Above all, nothing should be done at the\nexpense of the resources needed for the international\ndevelopment agenda.\nMost damaging of all is the increasing tendency\nto attribute linkages between international terrorism\nand Islam. The time has indeed arrived for us to\ndebunk, once and for all, the theory that there is a clash\nof civilizations. I speak from the experience of my own\ncountry, Malaysia, where we have shown that Islam is\nnot an impediment to modernity and to democracy. It is\nnot an impediment to rapid economic growth, to self-\nrespect and confidence, to tolerance and mutual respect\nacross religions, cultures and ethnic groups. In\nMalaysia, we celebrate the multi-ethnicity of our\npeople, of Malaysians. For us, our multi-ethnic and\ncultural diversity is a national asset. It has taught us to\nbe tolerant, value mutual respect and cooperate for the\ncommon good. We sincerely believe that this message\ndeserves a wider audience.\nI am certain that the Organization of the Islamic\nConference would be supportive of a dialogue designed\nto create greater understanding between peoples and\ncivilizations and that would lead to real action and\neffect changes at the societal level. The Non-Aligned\nMovement, too, would be equally keen to support\ninitiatives that would have the effect of establishing\nharmony and restoring stability in the world.\nSince the stability of many nation-States\ncontinues to be threatened, especially by armed\nconflicts, there is a critical need, more than ever, for\nMembers of the United Nations to unite and close\nranks to put a stop to such conflicts, be they inter-State\nor intra-State.\nIraq is still in turmoil. Although Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June 2004 enabled the\nreturn of sovereignty to the people of Iraq, the\nunrelenting conflict continues in that country. The\nsame resolution also renewed the mandate of the\nmultinational force, but the reality on the ground\nsuggests that the existing arrangements cannot stabilize\nthe situation there.\nThe situation in Iraq clearly calls for the United\nNations to be given the lead role, particularly in\nestablishing stability in preparation for the elections\nscheduled for January 2005. Orderly elections are\ncritical to the process of re-establishing a truly\nindependent and sovereign Government in Iraq.\nThe United Nations also has the best credentials\nto enable Member States to take part in peace-building\nand in the reconstruction of Iraq. The international\ncommunity owes it to the people of Iraq to summon its\ncollective resolve and political will to allow all of that\nto happen. If we collectively succeed in assisting Iraq\nto seize the moment, we would also succeed at the\nsame time in bringing a closure to the bitter\ndivisiveness which was brought about, in the\nbeginning, by unilateralism over that same issue.\nWhile the precarious situation in Iraq cries out for\nUnited Nations action, the plight and suffering of the\npeople of Palestine remains a tragic embodiment of the\nconsequences of non-implementation of United\nNations resolutions and the non-enforcement of United\nNations decisions. We must actively revive the road\nmap for peace in the Middle East, which remains\nunimplemented. The Quartet needs to play a more\nvigorous role. The international community must lend\nits full weight to push for an independent and\nsovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its\ncapital, and with Israel and Palestine living peacefully,\nside by side within secure and recognized borders.\nTo create an environment of confidence for the\nspeedy resuscitation of the road map, we must\nseriously consider approving the deployment of a\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force or the deployment\nof an international monitoring mechanism to oversee\nthe implementation of the road map for peace in the\nMiddle East.\nWe must also find ways to give effect to the\nhistoric advisory opinion of the International Court of\nJustice on the legal consequences of the construction of\na wall in the occupied Palestinian territory. In October\nlast year, the General Assembly overwhelmingly\nadopted a resolution demanding that Israel stop and\nreverse construction of the wall built in the West Bank.\nIt is unacceptable that a multilateral resolution giving\neffect to the International Court of Justice\u2019s advisory\nopinion cannot be effectively implemented. Clearly, the\nsearch for peace and security also depends on our\nwillingness and determination to ensure its\nenforceability.\n4\n\nI strongly believe that multilateralism is the only\napproach for implementing resolutions and decisions\nconcerning global peace and security. Adherence to the\nCharter of the United Nations should be a solemn\nobligation, not a matter of choice. For Malaysia, the\nUnited Nations is crucial as the guarantor of the\nsanctity of our existence as a sovereign nation and as\nthe institution where the principles of international law\nare protected and safeguarded. Small nations such as\nMalaysia do not have the military and other means to\ninsulate themselves from invasion or occupation by big\nPowers. But no sovereign nation should ever be\nsubjected to the threat of military action by another. No\ninternational intervention should ever be undertaken\nunless consistent with the United Nations Charter. If\nthe law of the jungle were to prevail, the small and the\nweak would certainly perish.\nIn this matter, no one should ever lose sight of the\nfact that when the defence of the nation-State is called\nfor, it is actually the well-being of the State\u2019s people\nthat is at stake. The world must take special note of\nthis and give due recognition to the voices and the\ncontributions of global civil society in matters\naffecting international peace and security.\nTo foster genuine peace and security, the world\nnaturally looks to the big Powers for leadership. A\nsincere commitment to multilateralism on the part of\nthe big Powers will send a strong signal to all nations,\nlarge and small, that the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations shall form the basis of the conduct of\nrelations between nations. Such a commitment will\nalso provide the foundation for a true international\npartnership, not only for establishing global peace and\nsecurity but also for achieving international economic\nand social development. Of course, multilateralism can\nbe sustained only if it embraces all nations as\nimportant stakeholders and excludes none.\nTherefore, urgent steps must be taken to make\nmultilateral processes relevant and effective. To begin,\nthe principal organs of the United Nations, in particular\nthe Security Council, should be rendered more\ndemocratic and more representative of the number and\ngeographical distribution of its international\nmembership. The exercise of the veto by the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council should be regulated\nin order to prohibit that power from being used at the\nsole discretion of its holder. It is unjust that any single\ncountry should be allowed the impunity of overruling\nat will the wish of the majority. That injustice can be\nrectified, for example, by enabling certain types of\nGeneral Assembly resolutions to overrule a Security\nCouncil veto.\nWe must find a comprehensive and just solution\nto the problem of Palestine. We must allow the United\nNations to take the lead role in stabilizing the situation\nin Iraq. We need to address seriously and resolutely the\nscourge of international terrorism, the elimination of\nglobal poverty, the proliferation of transnational\ncrimes, the destruction of the environment and the\nspread of the AIDS epidemic, as well as the economic\nand social advancement of all humankind. The global\neconomic order, especially in the sphere of\ninternational finance, must be made more fair and\nequitable. The way forward and our best hope lie in\nuniversal commitment now to multilateralism."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to extend my warm\ncongratulations upon your election to the presidency of\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. That\nelection is a resounding tribute by the international\ncommunity to Gabon, that brother country, for its\nsingular leadership role in Africa, and for the personal\ncommitment of President Omar Bongo Ondimba that\nhas enabled Central Africans to be reconciled today,\nfor which we are most grateful. Your great experience\nand ability as a diplomat and a statesman assure us of\nthe success of our work.\nHis Excellency Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, President of the\nRepublic and Head of State of my country, whose faith\nin the ideals of this Organization are unwavering,\nwishes you all success. As you might expect, my\ndelegation will be fully with you in your endeavours. I\nwould like to recall the competence with which your\n18\n\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia,\nconducted the work of the fifty-eighth session.\nAllow me to extend to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan the appreciation of the Central African Republic\nfor his endeavours to strengthen peace wherever it is\nthreatened and his resolve to find ways and means to\npreserve the authority and credibility of the United\nNations, which has been so sorely tried in recent years.\nBefore making its contribution and offering its\nthoughts on the state of the world, my delegation\nwould like to join with all those who have expressed\ntheir sympathy to the populations that have fallen\nvictim to natural disasters taking place in parts of the\nPacific and on the American continent, which have left\na woeful train of destruction in their path.\nThe major issues of the world today \u2014\ninternational peace and security, combating poverty,\ndevelopment, the defence and promotion of human\nrights, protection of the environment and health \u2014\ncannot find a lasting solution save through the common\nefforts of the international community through United\nNations. To echo the expressive words of the\nSecretary-General in his 2002 report entitled\nStrengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\nfurther change, \u201cThe challenge ahead is to strengthen\nour capacity for collective action and thus forge a\ncommon destiny in a time of accelerating global\nchange (A/57/387, para. 2)\u201d.\nIn that context, multilateralism, which is the main\nguarantee of the participation of all nations in\ninternational affairs, must be safeguarded and\nstrengthened at all costs. The spread of crisis\nflashpoints, the radicalization of international terrorism\nand organized crime, growing poverty and the spread\nof endemic diseases \u2014 all of those things should\nconvince us that only active international solidarity is\ncapable of ensuring stability and security for our\nworld.\nThe tenacity with which terrorism is defying the\ninternational community in so many different ways is\nindeed disturbing. That scourge knows no borders,\nrace, or religion. The attacks of 11 September 2001 in\nNew York and Washington, 11 March 2004 in Spain\nand 2 September 2004 in Russia are only its latest\nexpressions. Given the complexity of that\nphenomenon, we must arrive at a collective response to\nwhat has become a common menace. However,\nbecause our countries lack adequate means to combat\nthat scourge, the essential problem of cooperation by\nthe richer countries arises in order to obtain better\nequipment for detection, identification, surveillance\nand control on our land, sea and air borders. Similarly\nthe fight against transnational organized crime also\ncalls for large-scale cooperation under the aegis of the\nspecial fund for cooperation provided for by United\nNations conventions.\nThe difficult present international economic\ncontext has negatively affected the developing\neconomies in general and African economies in\nparticular. Stiff international trade competition,\nintensified protectionist practices, fluctuating\ncurrencies, the burden of debt \u2014 all these are\nhandicaps that are slowing the development of our\ncountries.\nIn Cancun last year, members of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) tried to relaunch efforts towards\nthe liberalization of trade. We must continue to seek\nsolutions to overcome the failure of Cancun and ensure\nthe success of the Doha round of trade negotiations.\nThe 2004 WTO meeting in Geneva is proof that we\nmust not stand idly by when faced with the policy of\nagricultural subsidies. The Millennium Declaration, the\noutcome of the Johannesburg Summit and the\nMonterrey Consensus have laid out the path to be\nfollowed and the goals to be pursued in order to\nestablish a true world partnership for development.\nSince the last General Assembly session, the\nworld has undergone a series of changes exacerbating\nan already deteriorated situation as a result of threats to\npeace and security and a growing number of points of\nconflict and tension. An example is the situation in the\nMiddle East, which is a source of deep concern.\nIndeed, despite the transfer of powers to the new Iraqi\nauthorities on 29 June, the spiral of violence continues\nuncontrollably, fuelling the Iraqi people\u2019s resentment\nof the international community. The recent\nappointment of a Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General in Iraq means that the United\nNations has a central role to play in the political\nreconstruction process there. However, the Central\nAfrican Republic ardently hopes for the\nimplementation of proposals already made by France,\nin cooperation with the Russian Federation, for an\ninternational conference on Iraq, within the framework\nof the United Nations.\n19\n\nIn Israel, the international community must\ncontinue to support the action of the Quartet to restore\npeace between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\nThere is no alternative to the road map, which calls for\nparallel advances in the three areas of security, politics\nand economics. In Africa, despite certain successes\nsuch as the return to peace in Angola, Sierra Leone\nand \u2014 little by little \u2014 in Liberia, the African\ncontinent is still a source of deep concern. The surge in\narmed conflicts, the tensions and the instabilities are\nbecoming a recurrent phenomenon. While the third\nAccra meeting favourably restarted the peace process\nin C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and gave rise to new hope, other\nsources of conflict are surfacing here and there.\nThe Darfur crisis in the Sudan continues to\nmobilize the international community\u2019s attention due to\nthe large movements of populations towards the\nborders with Chad and the insecurity that persists\nthere. My Government is following with particular\ninterest the developments in the situation in Darfur due\nto the humanitarian and security implications for the\nCentral African Republic, which borders on the Sudan\nand Chad.\nIn the Central African Republic, we support the\ninitiatives taken, since the Chadian mediation, through\ninternational forums, which have taken over from it in\nthe framework of the African Union and the United\nNations. We encourage the Sudanese Government \u2014\nwhich has proved its readiness \u2014 and the parties\ninvolved to follow the path of wisdom based on the\ndialogue established by President Olusegun Obasanjo,\nPresident of the African Union, and thus spare the\nbrotherly Sudanese people more suffering, since\nSecurity Council sanctions would only worsen their\nsuffering.\nThe massacre of 160 refugees in Gatumba on\n14 August 2004 on the border between the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and Burundi sparked\nwidespread indignation and exacerbated an already\ndelicate situation in that part of the Great Lakes region.\nHowever, our conviction is that despite the setbacks,\nthe various agreements between Rwanda and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the one hand,\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda\non the other, as well as the historic agreements of Sun\nCity, have finally made progress towards peace\nirreversible in the Great Lakes region.\nThat, in any case, is the purpose of our active\nparticipation in the preparatory process for the\ninternational conference on peace, security and\ndevelopment of the Great Lakes region and our\ncontribution to the stability pact that will emerge from\nit. This is within the framework of the global,\nintegrated and concerted approach sought by the\nUnited Nations, which has the advantage of pursuing\nregional solutions that will reach beyond the\ngeographical borders of the six countries of the Great\nLakes region.\nI would like to touch on the situation in my own\ncountry, the Central African Republic. Proclaimed\nindependent on 13 August 1960, my country has gone\nthrough relatively brief periods of political and social\nprogress, linked by long periods of economic\nstagnation and even retreat, justifying the opinions of\nAfro-pessimists about its chaotic development. As with\nmany other African States, a series of coups marked\nour political development. Some of these were palace\ncoups and others involved a true popular revolution\ncharacterized by both the crystallization of social\naspirations they unleashed and the political changes\nthey brought about, such as the Carnation Revolution\nof Portugal in 1974. The changes of 15 March 2003\nwere of that type. They were popular movements\ncarried forward by social forces that were as different\nfrom each other as were the involved political parties,\nlabour unions, religious bodies, non-governmental\norganizations and the army.\nI am pleased once again to pay tribute to the\nresolute action of our Organization and that of the\nwhole international community, which spared no effort\nbefore 15 March 2003 to find a happy solution to the\nCentral African crisis, mobilizing the Security Council;\nthe French-speaking world; the central organ of the\nformer Organization of African Unity (OAU) for the\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts;\nthe heads of State of the Central African Economic and\nMonetary Community, especially President El Hadj\nOmar Bongo Ondimba; the Economic Community of\nCentral African States; and the Community of Sahelo-\nSaharan States.\nFor more than a year, the Central African people\nhave been trying to rebuild their broken unity, while\nthe Government pursues the restoration of security\nthroughout its territory. Confidence is growing with\nboth our bilateral and multilateral foreign partners.\nConstitutional legality will be established at the end of\n20\n\nfree and transparent elections to take place in early\n2005. These are the main points of the timetable that\nthe consensual transitional administration set up in\nJune 2003 and that it has been pursuing ever since, in\nkeeping with its commitments.\nIndeed, the national transitional council, a\nprovisional parliament established in July 2003, is\nrepresentative of all of the socio-political forces of the\nnation and fulfils a legislative function, including the\nadoption of legislation and the oversight of\ngovernmental activities.\nThe timetable for the transition also provided for\nthe organization of a national dialogue. For nearly two\nmonths, from September to October 2003, all of the\nactive forces of the nation came together in this forum\nto search together for the deep causes of what has\ndivided us for so long. From these meetings emerged\nrecommendations, the main points of which underlie\nthe activities of our Government today and the\nfundamental law of our country, on which our people\nare preparing to vote through a referendum. An organ\nthat was specifically created to oversee the application\nof these recommendations, the national dialogue\nfollow-up committee, is now pursuing its mission.\nAn independent joint electoral commission, made\nup of representatives of political parties, civil society\nand the administration, was also set up, which has just\npublished the timetable for a future referendum and\nelections as follows: 30 November 2004, constitutional\nreferendum; 30 January 2005, legislative and\npresidential elections, first round; 27 February 2005,\nsecond round; 14 March 2005, announcement of\nresults.\nThe mission of the present transitional\nGovernment is to bring about conditions permitting a\nreturn to normal democratic life in the Central African\nRepublic. However, the grave financial difficulties\nfaced by my country do not enable it to face alone the\ncosts of these various elections. Of the 5.5 billion CFA\nfrancs necessary to finance these elections, we thus far\nhave only 3.5 billion. I would address an appeal for\nassistance to enable us to organize the elections under\nproper conditions and thus bring about a rapid return to\nconstitutional order.\nAs of now, my Government sincerely thanks the\nbrother countries and international organizations that\nhave so generously contributed to financing this\nprocess, especially France, the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, the European Union and the Central African\nEconomic and Monetary Community. The support that\nthe international community will provide to this very\ndifficult and delicate phase in the history of the Central\nAfrican Republic will be necessary to conclude this\nconsensual transition. Our common dedication to\ndemocracy prompts me to believe that this appeal by\nthe people and Government of my country will be\nheeded.\nThe challenges to be overcome in fulfilling the\ngreat hopes inspired by the changes of 15 March 2003\nare many and pressing. These same challenges\nprompted the establishment of an agenda \u2014 a road\nmap \u2014 that is focused on three major points: first,\nconsensual governance for a rapid return to\nconstitutional order; secondly, restoration of security\nand an effective return to peace; and, thirdly,\ncombating poverty. The measures adopted by the new\nauthorities, as they are outlined above, will lead to the\nrestoration of peace and national reconciliation and\nwere endorsed by the Central African people and\nrightly welcomed by the international community.\nToday, thanks to the re-establishment and\nrestructuring of our security and defence forces, the\npresence of the multinational force from the Central\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community, with\nFrance providing logistical support, and assistance\nfrom friendly countries, in particular France, Libya, the\nSudan, the People\u2019s Republic of China and Morocco,\nas well as the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, we\ncan say that the process of making the whole Central\nAfrican territory secure has made significant progress.\nEfforts are still needed to ensure full security before\nthe elections take place. But the relief felt by the\npopulation and the hopes inspired by the changes of\nMarch 2003 will be gravely compromised if the\ncommitments undertaken in this regard by the\ninternational community since May 2000 are not\nrealized.\nIt is also essential that we attack the economic\nand financial problems as part of the struggle against\npoverty. From that perspective, the Central African\nRepublic offers its full support to the Declaration on\nAction against Hunger and Poverty, adopted in New\nYork on 20 September 2004 as a result of a joint\ninitiative by President Chirac and President Ignacio\nLula da Silva.\n21\n\nThe post-conflict programme that my\nGovernment, working with the international financial\ninstitutions, has just drawn up provides a sound basis\nfor the reforms that are necessary if my country is to\nhave greater opportunities for success in the field of\nreconstruction.\nThe considerable efforts made at the national\nlevel and the steadfast support of the friends of the\nCentral African Republic, including France, the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the countries members\nof the Central African Economic and Monetary\nCommunity, have helped to lift the burden that salary\narrears imposed on the transition process, with the\nresult that the people of the Central African Republic\nwill emerge stronger and more united.\nI could not conclude without touching upon a\nsubject with regard to which all those who have spoken\nhave been unanimous: if we are to make progress in\nthis era, the United Nations must undertake a rational\nreform \u2014 a reform that is necessary if the Organization\nis to strengthen its role and enhance its effectiveness.\nThat reform effort must begin by reconfiguring\nthe Security Council \u2014 the central organ entrusted\nwith the major task of dealing with issues of peace and\nsecurity. From the perspective of the delegation of the\nCentral African Republic, the initiative of France and\nGermany calling for a permanent seat for Germany,\nand the similar appeal in favour of such seats for\nJapan, Africa and Latin America, should be given\nserious consideration.\nFurthermore, the proposal of the Chairman-in-\nOffice of the Economic Community of Central African\nStates, President Denis Nguesso, calling for a political\npresence in the United Nations in the person of a\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General for Central\nAfrica, is also worth consideration.\nThe Central African Republic will support\nproposals for reform submitted by the Secretary-\nGeneral insofar as they strengthen the role of the\nOrganization in the maintenance of international peace\nand security and the resolution of international issues\non the basis of the principles of dialogue and\nmultilateral cooperation."

        "file_text": "Sir, allow me to\ncongratulate you most warmly on your well-deserved\nelection. I am confident you will build upon the\nexcellent work done by your predecessor, Mr. Julian\nRobert Hunte, and lead us to a very successful outcome\nof this session. Special tribute is due to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, for his dedicated leadership.\nIn Bangladesh, we believe that the United\nNations provides an essential political and diplomatic\nframework for the actions of all its Members, including\nthe most powerful. The use of force without the\nauthorization of the United Nations Security Council\ncannot render the United Nations meaningless. We laud\nthe United Nations for its strong advocacy against\nunilateralism in the interest of a just global order. Our\nspontaneous endorsement of this principle is in\nconformity with the fundamentals of our foreign\npolicy.\nThe United Nations is not only a system for\nproviding collective security. It is also a\ncomprehensive international network of systems. It\ndeals with the work of myriad specialized agencies,\nestablishing norms, standards, codes and guidelines\nand buttressing the rule of law and the rights of\nindividuals. It embraces the world\u2019s trading, financial\nand monetary systems and promotes the cause of\ndevelopment. In our globalized world, there is no\nsubstitute for the United Nations. It is the only forum\nthat can deal with the cooperative management of\nproblems that recognize no frontiers.\nThe thirtieth anniversary of our admission to the\nUnited Nations this year marks a major milestone in\nour partnership with the Organization. It is a sobering\nmoment as much as it is one for rejoicing; for it is a\nrecord of our progress as a sovereign independent State.\nFrom the very outset, Bangladesh pursued two pre-\neminent objectives, strengthening responsibility at home\nand enhancing our contribution abroad. Our relationship\nwith the United Nations has been mutually rewarding\nin promoting peace and advancing development.\nShaheed President Ziaur Rahman laid the\nfoundations of our national development in the late\n1970s. His philosophy embraced reinforcing\ndemocracy with development. Our achievements are\nlargely due to this pursuit. It reflects our commitment\nto human rights, good governance and empowerment\nof the poor, especially women. Innovative ideas\nflowing from our own intellectual resources were\nharnessed, with the cooperation and support of our\ndevelopment partners and, of course, the United\nNations system. A free press and a vibrant civil society\n32\n\nbacked our efforts. The outcome was positive: it was to\ninvoke what the World Bank described as the silent\nrevolution that is Bangladesh. We are aware that much\nmore remains to be done.\nNatural disasters have often proved to be\nimpediments to our development. The excessive\nflooding this year is a case in point. Two thirds of the\ncountry was under water, and many lives were lost.\nOver 2 million people became homeless and our\ninfrastructure sustained severe damage. Better\npreparedness prevented greater losses. The courage and\nresilience of the Bangladeshi people in facing the\nsituation were indeed remarkable. We deeply\nappreciate the support and solidarity that we received\nfrom the international community this time.\nThe peculiarities of our geography render\nflooding a seasonal occurrence. It is therefore\nimperative that we seek measures that will address this\nrecurrent problem in a sustained and enduring manner,\nthrough proper management of the water resources in\nthe region. In the final analysis, long-term\nrehabilitation and reconstruction measures also require\ninternational support.\nDespite those occasional setbacks, we in\nBangladesh can point to progress in a number of\nimportant social and economic fields. Poverty\nreduction has been a central goal. We have reduced\npopulation growth by half, curbed child mortality by a\nthird, achieved food self-sufficiency for our people,\nimproved sanitation standards with home-grown\nmethods, and reduced ozone-depleting substances and\nvehicular pollution overall. Education has remained a\nmajor thrust of our Government\u2019s policy. Our school\nenrolment rates are among the highest in the\ndeveloping world, particularly for girls. Free schooling\nfor girl children, gender mainstreaming and the\nempowerment of women have helped create a vibrant\nand progressive society. In addition, ideas like micro-\ncredit and non-formal education have made famous\nbeginnings in Bangladesh.\nWe would be happy to share our experiences with\nother comparable societies, and the United Nations can\nbe an effective conduit for doing so. We encourage the\nUnited Nations in its role as a locator, collator and\ntransmitter of best practices. That is how the United\nNations can really help developing countries, by\npassing the litmus test of relevance, not in drafts and\ndeclarations alone but also in operations and\nimplementation.\nThe past decade has witnessed many important\nUnited Nations conferences focused on our critical\naspirations. The leaders of the world agreed on the\nMillennium Development Goals. However, the success\nof the Goals will largely depend on an enabling\ninternational economic environment, particularly in the\nareas of trade, finance, official development assistance\nand technology transfer.\nExtreme poverty is a gross denial of human\nrights. The disturbing experiences of recent years,\nincluding the rise in senseless terrorism, warn us that\nfailure in development is not an option, that poverty\ncan breed extremism and that to rid the world of its\ntragic consequences effectively its root causes must be\naddressed.\nIn today\u2019s world, trade remains a crucial vanguard\nfor development. Our active participation in the World\nTrade Organization and the United Nations Conference\non Trade and Development conforms to that maxim.\nUnhindered market access and special and preferential\ntreatment for the products of developing countries\nshould be at the heart of multilateral negotiations.\nManaged migration is an important phenomenon.\nHowever, the root causes of cross-border migratory\nflows need to be addressed in earnest.\nGreater focus must be placed on the full\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade\n2001-2010. The goals of the Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation and the Monterrey Consensus should\nbe pursued with determination.\nWhile it is important to set targets, it may be\nmore important to create the means to achieve them.\nFor the cause of development to progress, we need an\nenvironment of peace worldwide. Sadly, that is still\nlacking in many parts of the world.\nWe are concerned about the persistent violence in\nIraq. We are encouraged by the return of the United\nNations to the scene. We now expect the United\nNations to play a central role in facilitating the\ndemocratic process and in the reconstruction and\nhumanitarian work in that country.\nIn Afghanistan, the holding of a successful election\nnext month will be critical to the country\u2019s stability.\n33\n\nOur people cherish their close bond of friendship\nwith the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. We pray that\ntheir travails will be over soon.\nA core issue in the Middle East remains the\nunresolved problem of Palestine. The Palestinians have\nsuffered far too much for far too long, and the wall\nnow only exacerbates that suffering. Perhaps there can\nbe a two-State solution on the basis of the pre-1967\nborders, with an independent Palestine that has East\nJerusalem as its capital. Until that is achieved, there\nmust be respect for international law, and all peoples in\nthe region must be able to live in peace and security,\nfree from violence, destruction and acts of terror.\nWherever it has been possible, Bangladesh has\nnot fought shy of contributing to post-conflict stability.\nWe have always done so under the aegis of the United\nNations. We are near the top of the list of participating\ncountries with regard to peacekeeping. Over the past\n20 years, we have been involved in 28 United Nations\npeacekeeping operations across 4 continents. Currently,\nwe are participating in 12 of the 16 United Nations\nmissions. We have done so because we see this as\nadvancing our role and perception as a constructive and\nstabilizing international actor. We do not do it out of\nconvenience; we do it out of our conviction.\nWe believe that there is a direct relationship\nbetween disarmament and development. Bangladesh is\nparty to all major international conventions and treaties\non disarmament. Our geographical location makes\nnuclear weapons a direct and legitimate cause for\nconcern to us in the South Asia region. Bangladesh\ntherefore supports all measures, partial and otherwise,\ntowards arms control and conventional and nuclear\ndisarmament.\nBangladesh has condemned international\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We\nremain an active coalition partner in the war against\nterrorism.\nBangladesh has been playing an active role in\nmany important committees and commissions of the\nUnited Nations. We believe that the reform of the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council that is\ncurrently being discussed can truly help re-energize the\nsystem and enable those institutions to reflect the\nrealities of the contemporary world. Consultations\nshould be broad-based and should not be guided by the\nperceived interests of a few alone. Bangladesh believes\nthat any increase in the membership of the Council\nshould be based on certain criteria, including respect\nfor the principle of equitable geographical distribution\nand the aspirant\u2019s contribution to international peace\nand security, its proven track-record in democracy, its\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions, its\navowed commitment to nuclear disarmament, its\nprofile as a major partner in development and its\ncontribution as a voice of economically disadvantaged\ncountries. Bangladesh believes that the ultimate focus\nof any reform exercise should be on enhancing the\nCouncil\u2019s credibility and democratic profile through its\nworking methods and its decision-making processes.\nThe quest for world order must begin at our own\ndoorstep. Bangladesh is committed to maintaining the\ncredibility of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC) to provide its socio-economic\nmandate and to reduce tension and create a broad-\nbased climate of confidence-building. Bangladesh will\ntake over as chairperson of the thirteenth SAARC\nsummit in January, next year. The occasion will mark\nthe 20th anniversary of SAARC, and we look forward\nto celebrating the occasion with due solemnity as well\nas maintaining positive and forward-moving\nmomentum. Our overarching commitment, of course,\nremains poverty alleviation. All in all, we aspire to\nexpand our collective agenda for peace, progress and\ndevelopment in South Asia and beyond.\nI firmly believe that nations big and small, weak\nand powerful, all need the United Nations as much as\nthe United Nations needs them. It is only by combining\nour endeavours and uniting our resolve that we will be\nable to achieve our objectives of peace, security and\ndevelopment.\nThe power of humanity does not lie in the size of\nits armies but rather in the strength of its ideas, not in\nits ability to destroy but in its capability to build, not in\nits tendencies to despair, but in its propensities for\nhope. Our ability to tap this power for our own benefit\nwill shape our future in these times marked by\ndifficulties but also possibilities."

        "file_text": "I wish, Sir, to express\nto you my most sincere congratulations on your\nelection as President of this session of the General\nAssembly and to wish you every success in steering the\nwork of this body. I would also like to extend our\nthanks and appreciation to the President of the fifty-\neighth session of the General Assembly, especially for\nhis inspired efforts to promote so vigorously the\nagenda of United Nations reform and the revitalization\nof the General Assembly.\nAs this is the last session of the General Assembly\nbefore the 2005 major event, we must proceed to evaluate\nthe prospects for attaining the ambitious targets we set\nat the turn of the millennium. The major event will be\nthe first real assessment of our progress towards the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, of the\noutcomes of major world conferences and of initiatives\nsuch as the action launched by the Presidents of Brazil,\nFrance and Chile and the Prime Minister of Spain to\neradicate poverty and hunger, and the initiative of the\nPresidents of Finland and Tanzania on the social\ndimensions of globalization.\nSpecifically with regard to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, we believe that the ability to make\ndevelopment on the ground an issue of global concern\nas a result of those pledges will be a measure of the\nability of the United Nations to induce significant\nchange and advances where they are most needed.\nThe Republic of Cyprus supports the\nstrengthening of the United Nations system through the\nreform process that is under way and looks forward to\nthe report of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change and the recommendations of\nthe Secretary-General. We attach particular importance\nto the revitalization of the General Assembly and to the\nreform of the Security Council so that its structure will\nreflect contemporary political realities and a more\nbalanced geographical representation. In the spirit of\nthose two principles, and with the aim of reinforcing\nthe legitimacy and efficacy of the Council, Cyprus is\nsupportive of increasing both the permanent and the\nnon-permanent membership. In that respect, we believe\nthat the joint French and German position on the\nenlargement of the Council could provide a basis for\nachieving the aforementioned objectives.\nWe share the assessment of the Secretary-General\nthat consolidating effective multilateralism in a flexible\nand versatile United Nations is the best way to address\nthe complete spectrum of global crises and ensure that\npreventive mechanisms exist to avert such crises. Such\nconsolidation applies also to security deficits and\nparticularly terrorism, whose underlying causes we\nhave been unable to eliminate despite our concerted\nefforts. We consider that the conclusion of a\n5\n\ncomprehensive United Nations convention against\nterrorism is important in order to address more\nresolutely, within the framework of international\nlegality, the threat posed by terrorism.\nAddressing other deficiencies in the international\nsystem \u2014 particularly those that give rise to crisis\nsituations and to humanitarian disasters \u2014 should also\nbe considered a matter of both urgency and priority.\nOne such crisis is Darfur, which, following many\nothers like it, keeps Africa at the heart of our concerns.\nIt demonstrates not only why we should focus the\nmajority of our humanitarian resources and\npeacekeeping efforts on Africa, but also why we should\nundertake every possible effort to make sustainable\ndevelopment a global reality.\nThe Middle East is another region that remains\nvolatile, despite growing global concern and despite\nmany attempts to restore the peace process in the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. We deem to be necessary\nmore active involvement by the Quartet in the efforts\nto implement the road map and put an end to the cycle\nof violence. More emphasis should also be placed on\nthe task of improving living conditions in order to\nnormalize people\u2019s lives to the greatest possible extent.\nOur support remains focused on ending the occupation,\nachieving a just and viable settlement based on United\nNations resolutions, and the realization of the\nPalestinian people\u2019s aspirations for the establishment\nof an independent State, living side by side with Israel\nin conditions of sustainable peace and security.\nThe aspirations of humanity revolve around the\nachievement of full respect for human rights,\ndemocracy and the rule of law. The collective vision\nand effort required to fulfil that massive endeavour\ndemands the contribution of all, to the extent of their\ncapabilities. Cyprus is prepared to play its part from its\nvantage point in the European Union, while drawing\nupon its traditional participation in forums dedicated to\npromoting agendas pertaining to those values. That\naffiliation has been a source of support for us since\nCyprus\u2019s independence, and its impact not only makes\nus grateful but also has endowed us with sensitivities\nthat will continue to be an integral part of our\napproach.\nI would like to emphasize how proud we are that\nCyprus is now a member of the European Union. The\nUnion has outlined an extensive set of priorities for\nthis session of the General Assembly. As the statement\ndelivered Tuesday by the Dutch presidency has\ndelineated those priorities, I will not elaborate on them\nany further.\nThis year marks 30 years since the occupation of\n37 per cent of Cyprus\u2019s territory as a result of the\ninvasion of the island by Turkish troops. It also marks\n30 years of relentless efforts by the Greek Cypriots to\nachieve a just and peaceful settlement, with the support\nof the international community, for which I would here\nlike to express our deep appreciation.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s most recent effort to\nsolve the Cyprus problem resulted in a plan that was\ndescribed by some as a historic opportunity to solve\none of the most long-standing international problems. I\nwill outline only briefly why, despite the hard work\ninvested in the process by everyone involved, the end\nproduct of that effort was judged to have been\ninadequate and to have fallen short of minimum\nexpectations for a settlement for Greek Cypriots.\nFirst, the Annan Plan was not the product of\nnegotiation, nor did it constitute an agreed solution\nbetween the parties. Secondly, the Plan did not place\nthe necessary emphasis on achieving a one-State\nsolution with a central Government able to guarantee\nthe single, sovereign character of Cyprus. Thirdly, it\nfailed to address the serious concerns of the Greek\nCypriot community regarding their security and the\neffective implementation of the Plan.\nIn rejecting the Plan as a settlement for the\nCyprus problem, the Greek Cypriots did not reject the\nsolution or the reunification of their country; they\nrejected this particular Plan as not effectively\nachieving that objective. We remain committed to a\nsolution that will ensure the reunification of our\ncountry, its economy and its people.\nWe are committed to reaching a solution on the\nbasis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation. There are,\nhowever, a number of essential parameters on which\nthe Greek Cypriot community insists such a solution\nmust be founded: the withdrawal of Turkish troops and\nsettlers and respect for the human rights of all\nCypriots, the underlying structures for a functioning\neconomy, the functionality and workability of the new\nstate of affairs, the just resolution of land and property\nissues in accordance with the decisions of the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, and respect for the\nright of return of refugees. To that end, we welcome\nthe recent Pinheiro progress report on the restitution of\n6\n\nproperty in the context of the return of refugees and\ninternally displaced persons. Simultaneously, it distresses\nme to bring to the attention of the Assembly that\ncertain provisions of the Annan Plan have encouraged\nthe unprecedented unlawful exploitation of properties\nin occupied Cyprus that belong to Greek Cypriots.\nThe most paramount feature of any settlement is\nthe ability to instil a sense of security among the\npeople. In that regard, the mistakes of the past must not\nbe repeated. Cyprus must, in its future course, proceed\nwithout any grey areas with regard to its sovereignty or\nits relations with third-party States. If the people feel that\ntheir needs have not formed the basis of any solution that\nhas been reached or that the characteristics of that\nsolution have been dictated by the interests of third\nparties, then that solution will, unsurprisingly, be\nrejected. Indeed, in spirit and in practice, effective\nmultilateralism not only encompasses but also derives\nfrom the comprehension and consideration of local\nrealities and particulars, on which it must then proceed\nto formulate proposals.\nIn the framework of the European Union, and\nwith the aim of promoting reunification and\nreconciliation, my Government \u2014 despite the obstacles\ncreated by the current status quo \u2014 is consistently\npursuing policies aimed at enhancing the economic\ndevelopment of the Turkish Cypriots. We believe that\nsuch policies, while not intended to serve as a\nsubstitute for a solution, are the most effective way to\nfoster maximum economic integration of the two\ncommunities and to increase contact between them, so\nas to ensure the viability of a future solution.\nThe Cyprus problem is not always perceived in\nits correct context. The fact remains that this problem\nis the result of a military invasion and of the continued\noccupation of part of the territory of a sovereign State.\nThat fact should not be conveniently overlooked by\nconcentrating on peripheral matters. Any initiative to\nsolve the problem must have at its core that most basic\nand fundamental fact and must be based on the premise\nthat international legality must be served and the\noccupation ended.\nUnfortunately, the fundamentals of the situation\non the ground have remained unchanged for the past 30\nyears, since the Turkish invasion in Cyprus. That\nsituation comprises severe violations of the most\nfundamental human rights. The still-unresolved issue of\nmissing persons \u2014 an issue of a purely humanitarian\nnature \u2014 and that of the enclaved of the Karpass\npeninsula are in themselves an indication of the\nenduring suffering of Cyprus. That not only should\npoint us towards the specifics of the solution to be\npursued, but also must guide our actions with regard to\nmanaging the status quo. For instance, the United\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP),\nassigned the task of managing the status quo inflicted\n30 years ago, should remain specific to the situation on\nthe ground.\nThe accession of Cyprus to the European Union,\nin conjunction with the lack of an agreement aimed at\nsettling the Cyprus problem \u2014 despite our efforts and\nour preference for a settlement prior to accession \u2014\nsignifies the end of one era and the beginning of a new\none.\nI firmly believe that the new context defined by\nthe accession of my country to the European Union and\nby the expressed will of Turkey to advance on the\nEuropean path offers a unique opportunity and could\nhave a catalytic effect in reaching a settlement in\nCyprus. Our vocation is to be partners, not enemies.\nHence, in this new era, we call upon Turkey to join\nus in turning the page and in seeking ways to discover\nmutually beneficial solutions to the various aspects that\ncompose the Cyprus problem. The mere realization that\npeace and stability in our region serve the interests of\nboth our countries is ample evidence to prove that what\nunites us is stronger than what divides us."

        "file_text": "The\nelection of Mr. Jean Ping to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session does honour\nto our continent, to our subregion of Central Africa and\nto his country, Gabon. I congratulate him sincerely on\nbehalf of my delegation. We are familiar with Mr.\nPing\u2019s high sense of duty, his selfless dedication to his\nwork and his great skill, and we have no doubt that \u2014\nlike his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte\nof Saint Lucia \u2014 he will spare no effort to meet our\nexpectations.\nTo the Secretary-General we say how much we\nappreciate his initiatives and his tireless efforts to\nmake the Organization more effective.\nAt the Millennium Summit, Member States made\nsolemn and very important commitments. Today,\ndespite the fact that some progress has been made in\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals, the\nsituation remains troubling. The assessment of the\nimplementation of the Goals scheduled for 2005 is thus\nof particular importance. Here, we support all\ninitiatives that would give fresh impetus to\ninternational cooperation to combat poverty and\nhunger. I am thinking in particular of the initiative of\nHis Excellency President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil, which rightly\nfocuses on the Millennium Development Goals and on\nthe Monterrey Consensus. The African Union\u2019s\nExtraordinary Summit on Employment and Poverty\nAlleviation in Africa, held on 8 and 9 September in\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, was also intended to\naddress those concerns.\nIn spite of all the problems that have hobbled the\nDoha round of multilateral trade negotiations, the\nresumption of negotiations this summer in Geneva\ngives us some reason to hope for the establishment of\nequitable rules of international trade. We continue to\nhope for greater equity and solidarity among poor and\nrich nations with a view to achieving globalization that\nis fair. We therefore support the recommendations of\nthe World Commission on the Social Dimension of\nGlobalization.\nTo meet the Millennium Development Goals, we\nalso need peace and security \u2014 which, unfortunately,\nare lacking in a number of regions. The situation in the\nMiddle East continues to concern us. Peace, that\nfundamental aspiration, remains beyond the grasp of\n46\n\nthe peoples of the region; it is our joint responsibility\nto put in place the conditions for lasting peace.\nIn Africa, the attention of the international\ncommunity remains focused on the too-great number of\ncrises. To be sure, we can be pleased at recent\ndevelopments in the situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nfollowing the Accra III summit, but we must continue\nto work to make the process irreversible.\nIn the Sudan, the Darfur crisis continues to be of\ngreat concern, in both its humanitarian and its political\ndimensions. A greater mobilization by the international\ncommunity is required to support the efforts of the\nAfrican Union. The objective is to avoid a disaster and\nto ensure peace for the people of the Sudan.\nIn our subregion of Central Africa, we were\npleased with the positive outcome on 12 July 2004 of\nthe national forum held in Sao Tome and Principe,\nscheduled under the Memorandum of Understanding,\ndated 23 July 2003, and concluded under the auspices\nof the Economic Community of Central African States,\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the\nAfrican Union, the United States of America and\nNigeria.\nIn the Central African Republic, where there is\nstill a peacekeeping force of the Central African\nEconomic and Monetary Community, supported\nlogistically by France, our hope is to see the\ndemocratic process move forward and proceed to the\ngeneral elections which are scheduled for 2005.\nWe welcome the efforts of the international\ncommunity in Burundi \u2014 in particular, the South\nAfrican mediation \u2014 for the results achieved to date.\nWe call upon the political leaders of that country to\nremain focused on the national interests. Unity and\ndevelopment in Burundi depend on that.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\npolitical life in the eastern part of the country in\nparticular has recently been marked by a number of\ngrave events such as the Ituri crisis, the Bukavu\nrebellion and the Gatumba massacres. We renew our\nsupport for the global and inclusive agreement, as well\nas for the institutions for transition.\nWe call on the international community to\ncontinue to pay all the attention required to that\ncountry, and we support all initiatives that would\nincrease troop strength and the means of action of the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is in that context\nthat we are pleased with today\u2019s signature of the terms\nof reference of the joint oversight mechanism between\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.\nThat overview of the political situation in our\nsubregion, which includes a number of countries in\npost-conflict situations, fully justifies the request of\nCentral Africa to have a United Nations office. We are\npleased with the existence of the United Nations\nStanding Advisory Committee on Questions of\nSecurity in Central Africa and, in particular, the work\ngiven to that Committee. We wish to continue to have\nthe input of the Committee in its relations with the\ncompetent bodies of the subregion, in light of what is\nat stake.\nSimilarly, we expect implementation of the\nconclusions of the multifaceted mission that was\ndispatched to Central Africa in June 2003 by the\nSecretary-General. We appreciate those conclusions as\nbeing very relevant, especially those establishing\nprogrammes for disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration to help consolidate the peace processes\ntaking place; helping to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS;\nstopping the circulation of small arms and light\nweapons; protecting the environment and creating\nconditions for development in Central Africa.\nIn order to meet all of the challenges and to\nestablish all the conditions required for stability, we are\nplacing our hopes on the international conference for\npeace, security, democracy and development in the\nGreat Lakes region, preparations for which are already\nunder way. That conference will undoubtedly be an\nexcellent opportunity to search for lasting solutions to\nthe recurrent crises that cause bloodshed in the region.\nI reiterate my country\u2019s willingness to make its\ncontribution to that process.\nAs you know, the Republic of the Congo is\namong the countries in our subregion which is in a\npost-conflict situation. Under the leadership of\nPresident Denis Sassou-Nguesso, Congo is\nendeavouring at the same time, to consolidate peace\nand to re-establish a comprehensive macroeconomic\nequilibrium.\nAmong our current priorities, the question of\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration\ncontinues to be very important. Our national\nprogramme concerning those issues will, for the 2004-\n2006 period, involve more than 40,000 ex-combatants.\n47\n\nThe efforts of the Government, which are supported \u2014\nand we appreciate that support \u2014 by the European\nUnion, the United Nations Development Programme\nand the World Bank, will be continued. We would also\nappreciate any other contribution that would help the\nCongolese Government resolve that thorny issue.\nAdditionally, Congo, in hoping to benefit from\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, is\nvery sensitive to the decisions taken in Paris on 9 and\n14 September 2004, respectively, by the Paris Club and\nthe donors. Here I reiterate the appreciation of my\nGovernment for those efforts. Congo\u2019s eligibility for\nthat Initiative will undoubtedly allow us to allocate a\nmajority of our resources for development and\ntherefore to follow up with what was contained in our\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which we expect\nwill be validated by the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank.\nThat would help us succeed in our efforts, within\nour national plan, concerning good governance and\ntransparency in the management of our national affairs.\nTherefore, in following up on those various objectives,\nour country has joined the African Peer Review\nMechanism under the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment and we have signed on to the Extractive\nIndustries Transparency Initiative.\nConcerning the environment, we are involved in a\npartnership with the international community\nconcerning the Congo Basin Initiative. Brazzaville will\nshortly host a summit that will consider plans to\nconserve the forests of this world heritage area. We\ntherefore welcome the support given to that plan by\nFrance, the United Nations, the European Union, the\nUnited States, Germany, South Africa and a number of\nnon-governmental organizations.\nCongo reiterates its support for multilateralism.\nWe remain convinced that the United Nations is the\nideal framework for meeting the challenges that face\nthe world. But the world has changed. New challenges\nare before us that require reforms that will allow the\nUnited Nations to adapt itself to current missions and\nthe global configuration of the twenty-first century.\nWe therefore welcome the reform process\nundertaken by the Secretary-General and are truly\nhopeful regarding the recommendations of the high-\nlevel panel which was set up to examine the principle\nthreats and challenges to collective peace and security\nand to make proposals with respect to reform of the\ninternational system.\nAmong the reforms expected, we firmly support\nthe idea of enlarging the Security Council in its two\ncomponents, namely, permanent and non-permanent\nmembers. We must take into account \u2014 among other\nthings \u2014 the diversity of today\u2019s world in order to\nhighlight the criteria of geographical representation\nand of responsibility in the management of worldwide\naffairs, without ever sacrificing effectiveness,\ncohesion, transparency or credibility.\nAs was stated by the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his statement to\nthe General Assembly at the 3rd meeting, on\n21 September, \u201ctoday, more than ever, the world needs\nan effective mechanism through which to seek common\nsolutions to common problems.\u201d In order do this, we\nmust not only act together in complying with the rules\nthat we ourselves have implemented, but we must also\ncomply with the commitments we have made."

        "file_text": "The\nsession of the General Assembly over which you will\npreside, Sir, will be one of the most important in the\nhistory of the United Nations. It will be a session\ncharacterized by the necessary renewal of the United\nNations. The year 2005 will be decisive for the future\nof multilateralism and of our global Organization.\nThe debate on Iraq and the spreading wave of\ninternational terrorism have raised a series of questions\nabout the future of our collective security system. At\nthis session, the General Assembly has before it the\ntask of beginning an unprecedented reflection on the\nchanges our societies require of multilateral diplomacy.\nOur efforts must result in new tools that will enable the\nUnited Nations to find effective solutions to carry out\nthe lofty mission of tackling anew the tasks of\ndevelopment, maintaining world peace and security,\npromoting human rights and democracy and protecting\nthe environment \u2014 all under the rule of international\nlaw.\nAs a result of recent debates, some have raised\ntheir voices to assert that the international community\nis fractured and even in conflict. It is curious that that\nis happening at a time in the life of the world when\nthreats and challenges are more clearly shared by all\nnations. The tasks that should unite us focus on the\nfight against abject poverty, international terrorism,\norganized crime syndicates, major epidemics, the\nproliferation of arsenals of weapons of mass\ndestruction and the deterioration of the environment. In\norder to put an end to those ills, concerted action and\ncommitment are required from all States. The reason is\nobvious: the most complex threats we face do not have\nany specific national origin, but they affect us all and\nhave ultimately worsened the quality of life in the\nworld and damaged the peace and well-being of our\ncitizens.\nThe United Nations was designed to put an end to\nthe scourge of wars between nations and to promote the\neconomic and social development of peoples. We face\nphenomena of such magnitude and complexity that the\n35\n\ndelegates who attended the San Francisco\nConference \u2014 despite their outstanding talent and\nvision \u2014 could not have anticipated at the time. The\ndiplomats of our generation have the obligation of\nenvisioning a second phase, inaugurating a new chapter\nof collective action to eradicate these dangerous\nmodern-day evils.\nIn Mexico\u2019s view, the goal to which we should\naspire is not to rebuild the Organization from scratch or\nto discard the United Nations Charter, with its rich\nheritage of agreements and concepts. It would not be\nresponsible to abandon such essential tools as\nlegitimate individual or collective self-defence, as set\nout in Article 51, and the establishment of a collective\nsecurity system. The only viable, rational and\nnecessary approach is to update the multilateral system\nof cooperation and understanding that we have built\ntogether.\nIt was on the basis of those considerations that\nPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico, when he addressed\nthe General Assembly last year, made a robust appeal\nfor comprehensive reform of the United Nations.\nFurthermore, in many meetings that he has held since\nthen with other heads of State or Government, he has\nexpressed considerable interest in moving forward \u2014\nwith the urgency that the situation requires \u2014 towards\nstrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations.\nThat is why we have undertaken an effort of\nactive coordination aimed at reforming the United\nNations and strengthening multilateralism. Mexico,\ntogether with 14 other countries, has begun an effort of\njoint reflection to analyse the various components of\nreform and to devise a diplomatic strategy to guide the\nsteady progress of United Nations reform.\nWe envision reform with an evolutionary\napproach that would enable the United Nations to\ntackle the most delicate challenges and threats of each\nhistorical cycle, drawing on the resources and strengths\nof all Member States in order to overcome the most\ndisturbing international phenomena. That exercise\nshould begin to bear fruit in the next 18 months.\nTwo thousand and five will be an appropriate\nyear to promote this ambitious project: there will be a\nconvergence of events that will enable us to revitalize\nmultilateral dialogue and interaction. First, in\nDecember 2004, we will receive the report and the\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General\u2019s High-\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which\nwill be of valuable assistance in guiding our\ndeliberations on reform of the system. It will be very\nimportant that we examine those recommendations in\nminute detail and that the General Assembly be the\ncentral forum for discussing and adopting the new\nmandates and changes that must be implemented in the\nOrganization. Likewise, next year we will have to\nassess the progress made in implementing the\nMillennium Declaration and the steps taken to follow\nup the Monterrey Consensus on financing for\ndevelopment.\nThat series of events in 2005 will give us an up-\nto-date view of the state of the multilateral system and\nof the issues that reform should address. With that\nbroad perspective, and so that we can live up to the\ncommitment and interest of all Member States, we will\nneed to ensure a balance between the security and\ndevelopment agendas and their respective institutions\nwithin the system. The General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council must\nwork as part of an organic whole, not as entities that\nare disconnected and sometimes even at odds in their\ntasks, priorities and working methods.\nThe predominance of the Security Council has\nresulted in growing disregard for the work of other\nprincipal organs and has diminished their effectiveness.\nThis causes certain issues to be marginalized; then,\nwhen they reach crisis level, they become matters for\nwhich the Security Council becomes responsible. We\nalso must acknowledge that the overall process of\nUnited Nations reform has been dominated \u2014 in fact,\nparalysed \u2014 by the debate on restructuring the\nSecurity Council.\nMexico believes that any Security Council reform\nprocess should be governed by a set of common\nobjectives and criteria. After more than a decade of\nwork, we should ask ourselves why Security Council\nreform has not succeeded. The debate has focused on\nthe number of seats, how they should be allocated to\neach region and whether or not they should be\npermanent seats. Mexico does not share that approach\nbecause, paradoxically, the fundamental question that\nhas largely been ignored \u2014 which came to the fore\nduring the critical discussion on Iraq \u2014 is not how\nmany members there should be on the Security Council\nand how many should be permanent; rather, it is what\nkind of collective security system does the\ninternational community need today, and what\n36\n\nmechanisms should be used to face new challenges\nand, above all, to prevent conflicts.\nThe Security Council must create conditions that\nwill prevent the emergence of conflicts, particularly\nthrough building and consolidating national institutions\nand upholding the rule of law and respect for human\nrights. The Council should also enhance its capacity to\nconsistently identify situations likely to endanger peace\nand security. As a logical outcome of such an analysis,\nwe can then identify the changes needed in the Security\nCouncil.\nMexico acknowledges the contributions of\nMember States to the cause of peace, all of them\nnecessary. Our Organization, based on the legal\nequality of States, requires the commitment and\nsupport of all its Members, through their involvement\nin decision-making. The creation of new permanent\nseats would lead to greater concentration of the\ninternational decision-making process than is now the\ncase. We cannot ignore the fact that permanent\nmembers of the Council already have more influence\nthan the rest of the membership. Mexico considers that\nthis should be restricted and not further increased.\nMexico supports collective decision-making as\nthe source of the legitimacy and effectiveness of our\nactions in favour of peace and security. In that regard,\nwe favour a regionally equitable and balanced\nenlargement of the number of elected members, based\non modalities determined within the regional groups.\nThat would stimulate wider participation in the\ndecision-making process and would ensure that more\ncountries, not fewer, can contribute their views in the\nCouncil.\nThus, Mexico would support an increase in the\nnumber of elected members and an extension of their\nterm of office, with the option of immediate re-election\nfor those States that have demonstrated, through their\nperformance, a strong commitment to the purposes of\nthe Organization. That would help us to create a\ngenuine mechanism for accountability, founded on\nArticle 24 of the Charter.\nAs part of this integral vision of reform, it is\ncrucial also to strengthen the role of the Economic and\nSocial Council, which supports the Security Council\nand the General Assembly in the decision-making\nprocess. Conflict prevention depends upon timely\nattention to and action on problems that lead to a lack\nof access to development. It is undeniable that peace\nand security are anchored on the well-being of our\npeoples. Therefore, we believe that the Economic and\nSocial Council should work as a coordinating body to\nsteer the financing of development and to articulate the\nfollow-up of commitments stemming from United\nNations summits and conferences on social and\neconomic development.\nIt is essential to have a more committed\ninvolvement of the international financial institutions\nin the development process. In that regard, the\nEconomic and Social Council should play a pivotal\nrole linking the Bretton Woods institutions, the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), the private sector and civil\nsociety.\nAnother issue that is worth our attention in the\nreform process is the Commission on Human Rights,\nwhich has essential responsibilities regarding universal\nrespect for individual rights and fundamental freedoms.\nMexico considers that the work of the Commission is\nvital, although its procedural weakness in advancing its\nobjectives is clear. For this reason, its methods must be\nurgently reformulated. Mexico is fostering regional\ndialogue on this issue.\nThe ongoing effort in favour of United Nations\nreform requires a vision of collective well-being and\nenhanced political understanding, in order to prevent\n\u201cthreats without a passport\u201d from plunging the world\ninto a spiral of confrontation, violence and despair.\nHere, we should recognize that the United Nations has\nalready taken some first steps in the right direction,\nparticularly in the fight against terrorism and the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As part\nof the reform, it will be necessary to carry these actions\nfurther.\nIn this context, Mexico is ready to continue\nworking with the institutional structures of the\nOrganization, particularly the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee and the non-proliferation machinery. We\nwill continue to promote the protection of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms in the fight against\nterrorism as the only way to guarantee the legitimacy\nand efficacy of that fight. My country will also follow\nclosely the cooperation initiatives and regimes geared\nto control the export of nuclear materials; and we will\nstress the need to strengthen efforts in the urgent cause\nof disarmament.\nOther positive steps have been taken in recent\nyears to confront the grave challenges resulting from\n37\n\nhumanitarian crises and genocide. In this context,\nMexico concurs with the concept of the responsibility\nto protect, in the sense that sovereignty entails a State\u2019s\nobligation towards its population, and that, when it\nfails to fulfil it, the international community has the\nduty to collectively assist in the protection of\nindividuals from serious human rights violations. In the\nlight of recent regrettable humanitarian tragedies, it is\nof the utmost importance for the General Assembly to\ndiscuss this concept thoroughly, in order to elaborate\nguidelines for its practical application within the\nOrganization.\nBearing in mind the scope of the reform\nchallenge facing us, Mexico would favour the\nconvening of a general conference with the aim of\nupdating and strengthening our Organization. In\ncontrast to the consideration that has been given to\nother issues of international relevance, such as trade,\npopulation and the environment, we have not held any\nopen-ended rounds of negotiations in the last six\ndecades on issues pertaining to international politics\nand the progressive development of diplomacy. The\nchanges that have taken place in the world in that\nperiod demand a comprehensive exercise that should\nencompass the renewal of our commitments, review of\ncollective security structures and their performance,\nabove all, promotion of economic development.\nThroughout President Fox\u2019s administration,\nMexico has clearly shown its commitment to the\nstrengthening of multilateralism. We have done so as\nan elected member of the Security Council, as a\npromoter of international conventions on topics such as\ncorruption, persons with disabilities and migrants, by\nfurthering initiatives to foster the equitable and\nsustainable development of global areas and by hosting\nhigh-level conferences such as the Monterrey\nConference on Financing for Development and the\nSummit of the Americas.\nFurthermore, as an unequivocal sign of our\ninterest, our concerns and our commitment, Mexico is\ndecisively promoting the revitalization of the\nmultilateral system through the Group of Friends for\nthe Reform of the United Nations.\nIt is in that constructive spirit that Mexico is\ntaking part in this session of the General Assembly. We\nare certain that under your able leadership,\nMr. President, this session will be remembered as the\ncatalyst for one of the most important and dominant\nchapters in the life of our Organization."

        "file_text": "I should like to\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on his election\nas President of the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. He may be sure that Austria will fully\nsupport him in carrying out his important task.\nI fully subscribe to the statement made by the\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on\nbehalf of the European Union, which expressed the\nposition of the European Union regarding the various\nglobal and regional challenges we face today. I would\nlike to emphasize a few additional points from our own\nperspective.\nOver the past few years we have had to reassess\nkey concepts of our national and international security\nenvironment. With the emergence of new and complex\nthreats, in particular terrorism in combination with the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the\ninternational community faces unprecedented\nchallenges for which it has to find legitimate\nresponses. Just recently, we witnessed the horrifying\nterrorist attack against innocent school children in\nBeslan. This was only the last of a whole series of\nheinous attacks in all regions of the world targeted\nagainst innocents.\nAustria is committed to full cooperation with\nother States and United Nations bodies involved in\ncounter-terrorism and is working to promote the whole\nrange of United Nations action against terrorism. In\nVienna, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\nand its Terrorism Prevention Branch make an important\ncontribution by rendering assistance to Member States\nin implementing national legislation required by\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and in\nbuilding their national capacity to do so.\nAustria is convinced that only effective\nmultilateralism based on the rule of law can address the\nnew and complex challenges that the international\ncommunity faces today. We support the efforts of the\nQuartet in the Middle East peace process, and we urge\nIsrael and the Palestinians to implement their\nrespective obligations. The road map remains the only\nway forward towards a just, comprehensive and lasting\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict leading to two\nStates living side by side in peace and security.\nThe United Nations continues to play a key role\nin South-Eastern Europe, especially in Kosovo. We\nwelcome the recent appointment of Mr. Soren Jessen-\nPetersen as Special Representative for Kosovo. In that\nregard, within the European Union, the countries of the\nregional partnership \u00f3 the Czech Republic, Hungary,\nPoland, Slovakia, Slovenia and my country, Austria \u00f3\npresented concrete proposals with regard to security,\neconomic development, decentralization and the\nprotection of minorities and of religious sites. We are\nconfident that they can contribute to progress in\nKosovo.\nInternational and regional efforts are essential if\nwe are to contain and resolve the various conflicts in\n28\n\nother regions of the world. The dramatic situation in\nDarfur highlights the need for better harmonization of the\ninternational efforts of the United Nations, the African\nUnion, the EU, the League of Arab States, the United\nStates and other actors. We will have to examine\ncarefully the results of the current mission to Darfur of\nthe new Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide\nand the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nSuch missions and mechanisms are indeed the\ntools that the United Nations needs if it is to effectively\naddress emerging crisis situations. Strengthening the\nrule of law, human rights, democratic participation and\neconomic development will reduce the chance of\nconflicts within societies and among States turning\nviolent. In order to be a credible player, the United\nNations must be given the necessary institutional\nframework to enact effective strategies at all stages of\na conflict.\nAustria therefore welcomed the Secretary-\nGeneral\u00eds call for reform, in particular his initiative to\nestablish a High-Level Panel of eminent persons to\npropose specific measures for institutional innovation\nby the end of the year. I was happy to meet with the\nmembers of the Panel when it held its meeting in\nAustria earlier this year.\nOne item on the Panel's agenda is Security\nCouncil reform. Austria, like many other countries, is\nconcerned about the growing gap between the\nCouncil\u00eds current composition on the one hand, and the\nchanging political, economic and social reality of the\ncommunity of nations on the other.\nIt is essential to enlarge and balance the\nmembership of the Security Council, as well as to\nincrease its transparency. In order for all peoples to\nidentify with its decisions, we must ensure that the\nSecurity Council is a body that truly reflects the\ndiversity of the world's cultures and regions by an\nimproved representation of regions such as Africa,\nAsia and Latin America.\nAs you know, Sir, it is my personal vision that, in\nthe longer term, the European Union should also be\nrepresented in the Security Council. I pointed out\nduring the general debate last year that that would be\nthe logical consequence of further European integration\nin the field of common foreign and security policy.\nThe United Nations has been at the centre of\nAustria\u00eds foreign policy since we became a Member\nafter regaining our full independence in 1955. We have\nalways strongly supported the principles and purposes\nof the United Nations, and we remain committed to the\ngoals of the Charter.\nAustria feels honoured and privileged to host one\nof the headquarters of the United Nations. This year,\nwe celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening\nof the Vienna International Centre, home to many United\nNations institutions. The work of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency and the Preparatory Committee\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nOrganization with respect to nuclear non-proliferation;\nthe work of the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization on development cooperation; and the\nfight against the so-called uncivil society by the United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, contribute\nsubstantially to the international community\u00eds efforts to\nconfront the world\u00eds new security threats.\nIn this spirit of full and honest commitment to the\nUnited Nations, I would like to recall that Austria is a\ncandidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil for the term 2009-2010. Our candidature,\nannounced over five years ago - in 1999 - is based\non our willingness to contribute actively and\nconstructively to the maintenance of international\npeace and security. We fully recognize the heavy\nresponsibility which Security Council membership\nentails and we are ready to assume it.\nOver the past 50 years, Austria has sought to\ncontribute effectively to the work of the United Nations,\nin particular in the fields of peace and security, human\nrights, development, disarmament and international\nlaw. We are a significant contributor to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations and have traditionally been\namong the largest European troop contributors. Since\n1963, over 50,000 Austrians have served in more than\n50 United Nations missions worldwide.\nSecurity, as we see it, means human security. It is\nthe kind of security that all human beings are looking\nfor, among them millions of civilians in all parts of the\nworld affected by armed conflict \u00f3 the majority of\nthem women and children \u00f3 and 40 million people\nliving with the HIV virus. Human security transcends\nthe concept of hard threats and soft threats. If we see\nthose threats through the prism of the human beings\nconcerned, it becomes clear that for the afflicted\nindividual, all such threats - war, hunger, terrorism or\ndeadly disease - deprive them of their security.\n29\n\nAustria is honoured to chair the first Review\nConference of States Parties to the Anti-personnel\nMine-Ban Convention in Nairobi later this year, where\nthe international community will chart a course for the\nsolution of the landmine problem in the coming years.\nThe Mine-Ban Convention has become a true example\nof a successful and effective multilateral approach to\naddress a global problem. I encourage all States to\nparticipate at the Nairobi Summit at the highest\npossible level.\nAs a member of the Human Security Network, we\ncooperate with others to promote human security in the\nworld. To provide one concrete example, Austria -\ntogether with Slovenia and Jordan \u00f3 initiated and\nfunded an aid project for traumatized children in Iraq. I\nam convinced that applying a human security\nperspective to international problems has the potential\nof preventing or resolving conflict and promoting\npeace and development.\nWe also need to reflect further on how best to\nensure respect for human rights during conflict, how to\nincorporate human rights into preventive policies and\nhow to formulate post-conflict strategies likely to\nachieve lasting reconciliation and build a firm basis for\nthe rule of law and good governance. In that respect,\nhuman rights education is an important element in\ngetting to the root of conflict and breaking the vicious\ncircle of human rights violations.\nViolence between ethnic groups and religious\ncommunities has shaken countries across the globe. In\nparticular, the disregard for the needs and the rights of\nminorities tends to fuel violent conflict. Our\nendeavours for the protection of the rights of minorities\nare still highly needed, not the least to ensure that\nethnic cleansing or genocide will never happen again.\nWe know that the Secretary-General feels very strongly\nabout the need for speed of action to prevent the most\nheinous crimes. I share his concerns.\nThe Austrian Government is convinced that it is\nan essential responsibility of the United Nations and its\nMember States to address the root causes of conflict.\nGlobal poverty, inequality, competition for scarce\nresources, environmental degradation and the spread of\ninfectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, are among the\ningredients that fuel the outbreak of conflicts both\nwithin countries and among States.\nThe Austrian Development Policy has placed a\nparticular focus on poverty reduction, maintenance of\npeace and the protection of the environment. I am\npleased to inform the Assembly that Austria has\nincreased its development aid by 35 per cent this year.\nIn the area of environment and sustainable energy, we\nhave initiated and promoted the Global Forum for\nSustainable Energy, which aims at providing access to\nenergy for people in developing countries. We consider\nissues such as climate change, the decline of\nbiodiversity and other forms of environmental\ndegradation as essential aspects of our comprehensive\nsecurity agenda.\nLet me finally highlight an issue which the\nSecretary-General made a central theme of his address\nto the General Assembly. The key guarantee for\ncreating and maintaining peace and security in the\nworld has been and will continue to be an international\nsystem based on the rule of law. This was the very idea\nof the founders of the United Nations.\nI particularly welcome the Secretary-General's\npledge two days ago that he will make the United\nNations work to strengthen the rule of law and\ntransitional justice in conflict and post-conflict\nsocieties a priority for the remainder of his tenure.\nParticularly for smaller and medium sized countries, an\ninternational order based on the rule of law is of\nparamount importance.\nWith this in mind, I would like to announce today\nthat I have launched a discourse on the role and\nfunction of the Security Council in strengthening a\nrules-based international system. As a first step, we\nwill organize in November a panel of international\nlegal experts during International Law Week at\nHeadquarters, which will analyse the increasing law-\nmaking tendency of the Security Council.\nThis is my last speech as Austrian Foreign\nMinister. As you may know, I have been nominated\nCommissioner of the European Union for External\nRelations and European Neighbourhood Policy. This\nfunction will, of course, keep me in close contact with\nmany Assembly delegates and with the United Nations.\nI would therefore like to use this opportunity today to\nthank all colleagues, members of delegations and, in\nparticular, the Secretariat, in which I myself had the\nhonour to work, for the support that has been extended\nto me and my staff here in New York over the past\nyears. A special and warm expression of gratitude and\nrespect goes to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. To the\nPresident of the Assembly, I would like to extend my\n30\n\nbest wishes for a successful and constructive fifty-\nninth session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "We\nall pinned great hopes on the advent of the twenty-first\ncentury with regard to a more stable and secure world\nand sustainable development for humanity. We were all\neager to expand the positive achievements of the\ntwentieth century, which witnessed rapid technological\nand social progress, the beginning of the space age, the\nadvancement of democracy and the globalization of the\nplanet. We all wanted to leave behind the destructive\nimpact on human history of two world wars, continued\nblood conflicts, millions of refugees, poverty and the\ndestitution common in most countries of the world.\nIt had seemed that, at this junction of centuries\nand millennia, humanity would rediscover and\nappreciate more deeply the value of a world without\nwars or violence and the significance of solidarity and\nmutual understanding, of true human rights and respect\nof the views of others. Now, however, it has become\nclear that it is impossible to comprehend the dynamics\nof global development or to find adequate answers to\nmodern challenges without the United Nations as a\nleader.\nThe impression had been that, in the new century,\nour civilization would embark on the path towards a\nglobal society where harmony would prevail over\nhatred and stability put an end to suspicion \u2014 a society\nwhere the agreed rules of conduct set out in\ninternational law, binding for all, would stand in the\nway of isolationism and separatism; where all\ninternationally relevant issues, including the most\nurgent ones, would be resolved at the negotiating table;\nand where the use of force would not be the rule but,\nrather, the exception, and only when sanctioned by\ncollective decisions of a capable and representative\nSecurity Council.\nUnfortunately, the twenty-first century has\nbrought more new and menacing challenges than\nsolutions to the numerous problems faced by\nhumankind. The number of wars and military conflicts\nhas not diminished but increased. The peaceful\nresolution of the inter-Tajik conflict achieved under\nUnited Nations auspices is more the exception than the\nrule in the context of the efforts to achieve peace\nundertaken by the United Nations.\nThe world\u2019s peoples increasingly feel that the\nworld is in a state of permanent war rather than\nworking towards development. Every day we hear\nabout the dangers of the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and the struggle against international\nterrorism. These are urgent problems, and we cannot\nbut be concerned about them since weapons of mass\ndestruction are capable of destroying hundreds of\nthousands of human lives, while acts of terror can\ndestabilize entire countries.\nFor those reasons, we are firmly resolved to\ntransform Central Asia into a region free of nuclear\nweapons. The recent tragic events in the town of\nBeslan, in the Russian Federation, are clear evidence\n9\n\nthat the forces of international terrorism are, day by\nday, becoming more daring and continue to challenge\nthe whole of humankind.\nTajikistan resolutely condemns the acts of\nviolence perpetrated against defenceless women and\nchildren in North Ossetia and appeals to the\ninternational community to undertake urgent collective\nmeasures to combat this scourge of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nIt is comforting that the international solidarity\ndemonstrated in the struggle against such a\nbloodthirsty and treacherous enemy as terrorism is\ngaining in strength. Tajikistan has been actively\nwaging, at the regional and international levels, a\nmultifaceted struggle against the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and terrorism.\nAt the same time, in order to definitively put an\nend to terrorism, it is very important to reach a\nuniversal understanding of its nature and\nmanifestations in order to eliminate any obstacles that\nstand in the way of the development and adoption of a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nWhile we can rightly be proud of having created,\nwithin a short period of time, a united anti-terrorist\ncoalition of States, unfortunately we cannot say that we\nhave achieved the same degree of solidarity in the fight\nagainst poverty and destitution.\nFor decades, States with low levels of income\nhave not been able to free themselves from their\ndestructive debt burden so as to be able to enjoy the\nadvantages of civilization. For instance, Tajikistan,\nwhich lived through a civil conflict, continues to face\nurgent economic and social problems, despite having\nmade some economic progress. Eighty per cent of the\npopulation of Tajikistan still lives below the poverty\nline. Because of the lack of access to the sea, many\nregions of our country are cut off from the outside\nworld, which results in our paying higher prices for\nimported goods and increased transit fees. Forty per\ncent of all budget revenues go to servicing external\ndebt, which limits the Government\u2019s capacity to meet\nthe urgent needs of the population.\nWriting off a portion of the accumulated debt\nwould make it possible for those countries to invest in\neducation, health care and environmental protection,\nand, in the case of Tajikistan, could be helpful in\nrehabilitating the social sphere, which has suffered as a\nresult of the civil conflict and natural disasters.\nHowever, the idea of exchanging debt for sustainable\ndevelopment has not yet garnered solid support among\ncreditors. In that area, we still encounter inertia and a\nlack of political will.\nIt is clear to us that the resolution of political\nissues, including those related to international security,\ndepends, to a great extent, on social and economic\ndevelopment and on the achievement by all countries\nof the Millennium Goals.\nIn a globalized world, achieving the Millennium\nGoals will require the utmost solidarity as well as\ninteraction among the international community as a\nwhole, with the United Nations as a leading\ncoordinator, in its capacity as the most universal and\nrepresentative international Organization.\nThe key to success lies in developing a common\nand comprehensive approach to addressing poverty-\nrelated issues, enhancing the means available as well as\nseeking innovative ways of securing financing for\ndevelopment, eliminating ecological threats,\naddressing demographic problems, ensuring an\nequitable international finance and trade system, and\ndealing with the aftermath of natural disasters. Failing\nthat, the situation will remain the same: a quarter of the\nworld\u2019s population will continue to prosper, using more\nthan half of the world\u2019s resources, while the majority\nof the world\u2019s population, finding themselves\nmarginalized, will remain mere observers of global\neconomic development.\nThe ever-increasing severity of these problems\nmakes them global threats to international peace and\nsecurity. For that reason, we support the Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, in his efforts to restore the\nbalance of priorities on the agenda of the international\ncommunity.\nThe international community should also strive to\nensure maximum coordination of the actions taken at\nthe global level in terms of monetary, financial and\ninternational trade policies. In that connection, it is\nimportant to strengthen the role of the United Nations\nas the key force for political mobilization in those\nareas. That requires, on the basis of the Monterrey\nconsensus, a further reinforcement of the interaction\namong the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, which\nTajikistan hopes to join in the near future.\n10\n\nThe issues of economic rehabilitation, poverty\neradication, improved living standards for the\npopulation and long-term sustainable development are\namong the top priorities for Tajikistan, as an economy\nin transition.\nAt the same time, for a number of reasons,\nTajikistan still needs the assistance of the international\ncommunity in supporting national efforts to ensure\nlong-term sustainable development in the country. We\nappreciate the continued efforts of the donor countries\nand United Nations agencies such as the United\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, the World Food Programme and\nothers to assist vulnerable segments of the population,\nas well as their support in the ongoing transition to a\nsocially oriented market economy.\nGiven our own experience, we support the\npriority attention given by the United Nations to\nincreasing the effectiveness of the assistance rendered\nto countries in post-conflict situations and to receiving\nfeedback in that area. There is no doubt that the United\nNations is the key player in providing timely and\ncoordinated responses to post-conflict situations.\nThe success of the United Nations in this area\ndepends to a great extent on a qualitative interaction\nwith host Governments in the area of reinforcing\nnational potential, the introduction of effective\ninstruments and mechanisms for the coordination and\nmobilization of resources, and increased interaction\nwith the Bretton-Woods institutions in the context of a\njoint assessment of their needs and specific project\nactivities.\nIn this regard, it is noteworthy that one of the\nlessons learned from the peaceful settlement of the\ninter-Tajik conflict is the need for donor countries to be\nactive not only during the crisis but also in the post-\nconflict period. I am convinced that strengthening the\nfoundation of peace and stability in countries living\nthrough conflict requires not only humanitarian\nassistance but also actual help in addressing economic\nproblems and support for countries\u2019 efforts to create a\ndynamic and stable economy. As a rule, these kinds of\ninvestments, within the framework of a peaceful\nprocess, turn out to be instrumental in strengthening\nyoung democracies born out of conflict. There is no\ndoubt that the parliamentary elections to be held in\nTajikistan in early 2005 will prove once again the\nvitality and irreversible nature of the peace process in\nTajikistan and the robustness of the country\u2019s\ndemocratic institutions.\nAchieving ecologically sustainable development\non the global, regional and national levels remains an\nissue of top priority. Tajikistan intends to continue to\ncontribute to the implementation of the relevant\ndecisions of Johannesburg and other international\nforums. The 2005-2015 International Decade for\nAction, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, to be launched on 22 March\n2005, was initiated by our country and is expected to\ncombine efforts undertaken by Governments, the\nUnited Nations, international organizations, civil\nsociety and the private sector. These efforts are aimed\nat identifying effective ways of achieving the\ninternationally agreed goals in the area of fresh water\nresources, developing strategies, programmes and laws\nto protect water environments and increasing\ninvestment and voluntary donor contributions, two\nactivities associated with ensuring access to fresh\nwater to all persons in need. We ask the Governments\nof all countries, as well as United Nations agencies, to\nundertake practical activities within this decade. This\nis the key to success, and it will require a great deal of\nwork.\nIn some regions of the world, the international\ncommunity is faced not only with the problem of\nconflicts and wars that interfere with long-term\ndevelopment, but also with illicit drug trafficking,\nwhich poses a threat to civil society. We cannot help\nbeing concerned with the fact that global demand for\nprohibited drugs is not decreasing. For instance, the\nvolume of criminal transit of narcotics via Tajikistan\nconstitutes a serious threat to our social, political and\neconomic stability as well as to the security of the\nregion as a whole. Afghanistan remains a major\nsupplier of narcotics. Their production this year has set\na record.\nThe President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali\nRakhmonov, regards the struggle against illicit drugs as\none of the top priorities for our country. Thanks to the\ncooperation with the United Nations and interaction\nwithin Shanghai Cooperation Organization of the last\nfive years, Tajikistan has become one of the leading\ncountries in the world in terms of narcotics\ninterdiction. Over this period, the law enforcement\nbodies of Tajikistan and the Russian border guards\nhave confiscated about 40 tons of narcotics, with\nheroin constituting more than half of this total. As a\nresult, millions of dollars have been removed from\n11\n\ncirculation and hundreds of thousands of people the\nworld over have been saved from narcotics\ndependency.\nAccording to Antonio Maria Costa, Executive\nDirector of the United Nations Office on Drugs and\nCrime, Tajikistan sets a good example for other\ncountries as to how one can successfully struggle\nagainst drugs. The achievements of Tajikistan in this\narea are considered as a good basis for strengthening\nthe struggle against the narcotics threat, but we are\ncombating the results rather than the roots of the\nproblem.\nIn autumn 2005, heads of State and Government\nwill meet in this General Assembly Hall to discuss\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals. We attach great importance to this event, which\ncoincides with the sixtieth anniversary of the\nfoundation of the United Nations. We expect this\nforthcoming event to give the necessary political\nimpetus to the international community in its progress\ntowards the achievement through combined efforts of\nthe Millennium Development Goals in the interest of a\nmore stable, just and prosperous world."

        "file_text": "I stand\nbefore the General Assembly of the United Nations\nwith an equal measure of pride and humility.\nOf the more than 190 nations that make up the\nUnited Nations, Antigua and Barbuda is among the\nsmallest in population and land mass. In the face of\nthese strikingly modest statistics, my humility in\nstanding at this renowned and universally respected\npodium will be readily understood. The fact that\n21\n\nAntigua and Barbuda is accorded the privilege to address\nthe United Nations today is obvious cause for pride.\nOn a personal note, I have just completed my first\nsix months as Prime Minister in the first term of the\nparty that was elected to govern Antigua and Barbuda\non 23 March of this year. It is, therefore, a particular\npleasure and a special personal privilege for me to be\nafforded this opportunity to take the podium at the\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\nI take this opportunity to express my appreciation\nto the Secretary-General for the kind sentiments he\ngraciously extended on the formation of my\nGovernment. Considering that a single party had ruled\nAntigua and Barbuda throughout the life of our 23-year\nold nation, and for some considerable time prior to\nthat, my leadership and my Government are still in a\ntender state of infancy. I therefore trust that, should I\nbe guilty of any lapse in protocol during my remarks,\nyou will blame it on my innocence.\nThe removal of a long-entrenched Government\nmakes 2004 a year of dramatic change and intimidating\nchallenge for Antigua and Barbuda. The United\nNations human development index ranks Antigua and\nBarbuda in the high development scale. By virtue of\nour per-capita income, Antigua and Barbuda is\ndesignated a middle-income country.\nThough it is self-evident that all countries are not\ncreated equal, it is a fundamental purpose of the United\nNations to ensure a level playing field in the arena in\nwhich small as well as large nations of the world\nengage one another. I say this despite overwhelming\nempirical evidence that size and might often come into\nplay without subtlety, without apology and sometimes\nwithout sufficiently vigorous challenge in the affairs of\nthe United Nations.\nThe structure of the Security Council dramatizes\nthe reality that one nation, one vote, still has its\nlimitations. In this context, we might be tempted to\naccept, as Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipul asserts in the\nopening line of his book, A Bend in the River: \u201cThe\nworld is what it is\u201d. I submit that the overarching\nmission of the United Nations is to defy the status quo\nand to work unrelentingly to transform the world from\nwhat it is into what it can be. The logical and\nparticularly relevant concomitance to all of this is that\na fundamental function of the United Nations is to\nassist small Member States like Antigua and Barbuda\nto be all that we can be. We recognize that the United\nNations has been making every conceivable effort to\nmeet this mandate, most notably so under the\nstewardship of our indomitable Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan.\nNot surprisingly, small societies like those of the\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean have become casualties,\nnot beneficiaries, of globalization and of the new world\neconomic order. The United Nations acknowledged this\nin the Millennium Declaration. The Declaration\nconcedes that, while globalization offers great\nopportunities, its benefits are very unevenly shared,\nwhile its costs are unevenly distributed. It recognized\nthat developing countries and countries with economies\nin transition face special difficulties in responding to\nthe challenges of globalization.\nThe Millennium Declaration defined the need for\npolicies and measures at the global level that correspond\nto the needs of developing countries and economies in\ntransition and that are formulated and implemented\nwith their effective participation. It recognized a\ncollective responsibility to uphold the principles of\nhuman dignity, equality and equity at the global level.\nIt affirmed a determination to deal comprehensively\nand effectively with the debt problems of low and\nmiddle-income developing countries through various\nnational and international measures designed to make\ntheir debt sustainable in the long term.\nStill, the reality confronts us that the views of all\nother United Nations Member States are outweighed by\nthose of the five permanent members of the Security\nCouncil.\nMoreover, the world saw, not all that long ago,\neffective marginalization of the United Nations in\ndefiance of rational concerns, strongly expressed, of\nthe general membership of the United Nations. I have\nno desire to be trampled underfoot by the elephants\nengaged in the historic battle that raged in this forum\nbefore it moved to its still active theatre in the Middle\nEast earlier this year. I am, however, compelled to\nwonder by what process the United Nations appears to\nhave ruled out a negotiated resolution of the ongoing\nwar in Iraq as an option.\nIt is lamentable that, in meeting the unique needs\nof vulnerable small States and microeconomies, the\nUnited Nations is routinely sidelined in international\ntrading relationships and development processes. The\nUnited Nations is not recognized as a key catalyst in\ndefining the world economic order and international\n22\n\ntrading arrangements in the twenty-first century. That\nagenda is understood to be directed by entities such as\nthe World Trade Organization, the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the\nFinancial Action Task Force, the International\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. Two of those\norganizations are assemblies of a small number of\nwealthy nations that do not necessarily attach adequate\npriority to the vulnerability of small States and\neconomies in transition.\nWe are not all convinced that those organizations,\nwhose decisions can well determine the destiny of\nsmall States like Antigua and Barbuda \u2014 and the now\ndesolate Grenada and Haiti \u2014 are sufficiently responsive\nto the special needs of small Caribbean States.\nIndeed, the instances in which small countries of\nthe Caribbean have been targets of the OECD and the\nmighty United States are vivid in our consciousness.\nSuper Power intervention in traditional arrangements\nbetween Europe and the Caribbean for bananas and\nsugar has been no less devastating, and it has certainly\nbeen farther reaching than Hurricane Ivan\u2019s savage\ndemolition of Grenada. The OECD offensive against\nwhat were termed \u201charmful tax jurisdictions\u201d,\nmanifestly discriminated against international financial\ncentres in the Caribbean. Our responses to this\nchallenge were responsible and effective.\nWe would like to think that the English-speaking\nCaribbean countries are model nations in the family of\nman. We represent a zone of peace in a world shattered\nby internecine and international wars. We maintain\nexemplary parliamentary democracies. With a few sad\nexceptions, we in the Caribbean change our\nGovernments by the ballot, and by no other means.\nThough we are small, we are overwhelming in\nhuman worth. The Commonwealth Caribbean gave\nBob Marley to the world. We gave Nobel Laureates\nArthur Lewis, Derek Walcott and Vidia Naipaul to the\nworld. We have given our music to the world in the\nform of reggae, calypso, soca and steel band. We have\nenriched the cuisines of the world. We have given the\nfastest female track athletes to the world. We have\ncontributed to the standard of academia around the\nworld through the export of many of our finest minds.\nWe have been blessed with the most desirable\nbeaches in the world, and we welcome the world to\nshare our beaches and our incomparable natural\nenvironment. Our islands represent green points of\nlight on a globe convulsed by callous attitudes to the\nenvironment among certain developed countries, and\namong countries in transition, as well.\nSmall though our nations may be, we are mighty\nwarriors in strong and effective alliances with the\nUnited States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other\nnations in the war against the international narcotics\nsyndicates.\nI deem it my country\u2019s civic responsibility to\nremind this body of our duty to fulfil our role as\noutlined in the preamble of the United Nations Charter,\nto be the central area for harmonizing the actions of\nnations in achieving international cooperation in\nsolving issues of a humanitarian nature.\nToday two nations within the Caribbean region,\nGrenada and Haiti, have been devastated by natural\ndisaster. Some 90 per cent of Grenada\u2019s housing stock\nhas been destroyed. Civil society is in deep trauma.\nThe economy has been wiped out and the Government\nis completely immobilized. This means that there is an\nineffective authority.\nMore than 1,000 persons have just died in Haiti\nin the wake of Hurricane Jean, with the figure expected\nto double in days. The dead are being buried in mass\ngraves to prevent a health epidemic. Homes and crops\nhave been destroyed, with floodwater lines on\nbuildings measuring up to 10 feet high. Survivors in\nHaiti\u2019s third largest city, Gonaives, are hungry, thirsty and\nincreasingly desperate. United Nations peacekeepers and\naid agencies are stretched to the limit.\nGrenada and Haiti are now suffering a condition\ncomparable to a massive military bombardment.\nAgainst this backdrop, I urge the United Nations \u2014\nevery nation, large and small \u2014 to intervene in those\ntwo Caribbean countries devastated by recent\nhurricanes. They are certifiable disaster areas.\nAn adequate response from all of us, and even\nmore so from the developed countries, to the plight of\nGrenada and Haiti would be a quantum leap to recovery\nand reconstruction for them and the best option to ease\nthe suffering of their battered and distressed people. We\nmust act quickly. We must act now.\nIf I may be so bold, I would like to say that my\ncountry, Antigua and Barbuda, is a veritable United\nNations in microcosm. It has become home to a\nrelatively larger proportion of immigrants from\nCaribbean countries than has any other Caribbean\n23\n\nState. On any day, on any street in St. John\u2019s, Antigua\nand Barbuda\u2019s capital, you will hear virtually every\nCaribbean inflection, English and Hispanic. You will\nalso hear accents from China, Syria, Lebanon, Europe\nand Africa. Indeed, we are celebrating Antigua and\nBarbuda\u2019s unique diversity with the construction of a\nCaribbean Festival Park that will be a permanent\nshowcase and celebration of the essence of the entire\nCaribbean region.\nI have chosen to use this opportunity to urge the\nUnited Nations General Assembly to petition powerful\nnations and agencies of the world for a review of the\npolicy of penalizing small States that achieve a\nmeasure of success in the process of guiding their\neconomies to growth and their citizens to better lives.\nIs it not ironic that, only in the area of development\nfunding, achieving \u201cgraduation\u201d is rewarded with\npunishment? Development funding dries up; technical\naid is more difficult to access when small States begin\nto show signs of prosperity. The effect of this is really\nto pull out the carpet from under small States the\nmoment they stand up. Small developing States will\nnever be insulated against external shocks.\nThe international security measures mandated by\nAmerica\u2019s post-9/11 Patriot Act have inflicted an\ninordinate financial burden on the small economies of\nCaribbean member States. We have been compelled to\nfinance security infrastructure for which we had no\nprovisions. With intensified security concerns in the\nUnited States, Caribbean countries are confronted with\nincreasing waves of deported felons from the United\nStates. This carries the risk that, among these\ndeportees, there might well be prime recruits for\norganized crime and narco-trafficking. Caribbean\nsocieties are simply not equipped to respond\neffectively to those challenges.\nAmong member countries of the Organization of\nEastern Caribbean States, Antigua and Barbuda is\nconsidered to be relatively affluent. The grim reality is\nthat Antigua and Barbuda is confronted with an\neconomy that has been experiencing sustained decline.\nThe country has been accumulating crippling debt. We\nare uncovering disturbing levels of unemployment,\nparticularly among our young people. This can well place\na significant proportion of our youth at serious risk.\nMany of these concerns are common to small\nStates of the Caribbean. Policies and rules are made in\norganizations controlled by the powerful few. This\nbrings us to the contradiction that, as small States strive to\nbe all that we can be, we are penalized for our success.\nPolicy makers in the developed world, donor\ncountries and multilateral donor agencies should not\ntake our natural and physical attributes as barometers\nof our economic and social development.\nIn this age of globalization, where the emphasis\nis on bigness, being small is definitely a disadvantage\nof major magnitude. Small economies cannot easily\ndiversify production. Jobs are concentrated in a limited\nnumber of industries \u2014 namely, agriculture, tourism\nand services. Tragically, we are now encountering a\nsituation where our unemployed young people are\neasily induced into the drug trade.\nGiven that the Caribbean region is a recognized\ndrug trans-shipment point between Latin America and\nthe United States and Europe, the attraction of easy\nmoney and effective marketing to youth by drug dons\nmake this job opportunity very attractive to the youth\nof the Caribbean region.\nMy party, the United Progressive Party, campaigned\non a platform of transparency, accountability and\nintegrity in every functional aspect of government, and\nthroughout the society as a whole. As a demonstration of\nmy Government\u2019s seriousness in combating corruption, I\ntabled anticorruption and integrity legislation in our\nParliament during our first six months in Government.\nMy Government and the majority of the people of\nAntigua and Barbuda are committed to every option\nthat will support our dedication to good governance in\nour country.\nI challenge the United Nations to stand by the\ntenets of the Millennium Declaration, which call for\nequity among nations, large and small. There is a\ncompelling reason for this call.\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) countries are\ncurrently engaged in three separate sets of negotiations\nthat will seriously impact the economies of our\ncountries and the welfare of our people. To date, there\nhave been no concessions afforded to the special needs\nof small States in our negotiations with the European\nUnion, on the Free Trade Area of the Americas and\nwith the World Trade Organization. Not everyone\nengaged in these negotiations appears to be in\nsympathy with the fundamental goals of the United\nNations Millennium Declaration.\n24\n\nIf affirmative action is not to be proffered to\nAntigua and Barbuda and other small States of the\nCaribbean region and the world, let us at least be\nspared punitive suspension of whatever special\nfacilities enabled us to move our economies forward.\nAntigua and Barbuda thanks this General\nAssembly for the opportunity to propose that, in\nkeeping with the letter and the spirit of the United\nNations Millennium Declaration, small States, such as\nthose of CARICOM, should be afforded the promised\nopportunity to be beneficiaries of globalization and the\nnew world economic architecture, instead of leaving us\ncasualties, as we must now be accurately described."

        "file_text": "At the outset,\nallow me, on behalf of the Government and people of\nSolomon Islands, to convey to you our warm and\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of\nthis session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, our colleague, the Honourable Julian\nHunte, Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia, for his able\nand sterling stewardship in making the Assembly\u2019s\nfifty-eighth session proactive and responsive to the\nchallenges it has faced over the last 12 months.\nI also wish to express our deep appreciation to\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his focused leadership in steering\nthe work of the Secretariat through difficult and\nsometimes uncharted waters over the past year.\nOnly four years into the new millennium, the\ncomplexity of ongoing and new challenges has\nredefined the international system, resulting in\nuncertainty and imbalances in certain parts of the\nglobe. Ensuing debates over multilateralism versus\nunilateralism in the resolution of crisis situations have\nepitomized the complex nature of events during the\npast year. This makes the call two years ago by our\nSecretary-General for institutional reforms more urgent\nnow than ever before.\nSolomon Islands looks forward to the\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel of Eminent\nPersons, in particular, to proposals that will revitalize\nand give new momentum to the United Nations. These\nreforms must ensure that the United Nations is flexible\nand responsive to the needs of our time. To this end,\nSolomon Islands fully supports the proposed\nenlargement of the Council and reaffirms its call for\nJapan and Germany to become permanent members of\nthe Council. We believe that the enlargement should\naffect both the permanent and non-permanent\nmembership categories. It is also our fervent hope and\ndesire to see that the Secretariat reflects the diversity\nof its membership. In this regard, while it should\ncontinue to recruit the best available candidates,\nopportunities within the Secretariat must be made\navailable to small island countries on the basis of in-\ncountry, rather than externally conducted, assessment\nexaminations.\nAs you are aware, this year the United Nations\nfamily marked the tenth anniversary of the ethnic\n15\n\ngenocide in Rwanda. The occasion called on the United\nNations to play a more proactive role towards ensuring\nthat such tragic events are never allowed to happen\nagain.\nNo more than four years ago, my own country,\nSolomon Islands, experienced the hardship of a\nconflict situation when tensions erupted between two\nof the many ethnic groups in the country. In response,\nSolomon Islands sought assistance from every possible\ninstitution, including the Security Council. In this\nregard, I am pleased to say that my region, through the\nPacific Islands Forum under its security mechanism as\nenshrined in the Biketawa Declaration, responded to\nthat \u201c911\u201d call.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum regional security\nmechanism is in harmony with the spirit of Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. The Regional\nAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), led\nby our bigger regional neighbour, Australia, strongly\nsupported by New Zealand and other Pacific Islands\nForum member countries, went beyond the mere\nrestoration of law and order and security. In a spirit of\nPacific cooperation and partnership between Solomon\nIslands and Pacific Islands Forum member countries, a\nlong-term approach of strengthening the country\u2019s\nState institutions was set in place, thus allowing the\nprocess of healing, reconstruction, rehabilitation and\nnation-building to continue the course of unifying the\ncountry and its less than half a million, but diverse,\ninhabitants, who speak some 80 different local\nlanguages.\nThe success of the Regional Assistance Mission\nto Solomon Islands in promptly stabilizing the country\nwithin a period of three months, collecting some 3,700\nweapons without a shot being fired, presents a fine\nexample of the importance of regional cooperation in\nresolving conflict situations. On this note, I wish to pay\ntribute to all our Pacific neighbours and to the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nCommission for Human Rights, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), the European Union (EU), the\nRepublic of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the\nInternational Red Cross and the civil society; they have\nassisted and are continuing to assist in the process of\nour country\u2019s ongoing recovery and rehabilitation.\nI must also underscore my belief and conviction\nthat in order for peace to be achieved it must be\ndesired; moreover, I would add, there must be a\nworkable mechanism to ensure its realization and\nsustenance. In this regard, my Government is fully\nconvinced that the positive results of our partnership\nwith RAMSI could be sustained through our recently\nadopted National Economic Recovery, Reform and\nDevelopment Plan (NERRDP), which provides a\nblueprint for an integrated process of development and\nnation-building for the common good of our people.\nI am further convinced, that the Pacific Plan\nrecently adopted by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\nin Apia, Samoa, represents a regional road map for\ncooperation that could complement national efforts\naimed at building an improved and secure livelihood\nfor the diverse people of the region. Through its\ncreation of stronger and deeper links between countries\nin the region and resource-sharing, including\ngovernance and aligning of policies, the Pacific Plan\ncould assist our countries to address challenges and\nissues that sovereign member States may lack the\nability and capacity to address individually as a result\nof our countries\u2019 smallness and inherent limitations\ncaused by economies of scale.\nSolomon Islands notes the positive developments\nthat have taken place in the peace process on\nBougainville. We recognize the important role played\nby the United Nations in the peace process there and\nwould urge its continuing involvement to see the\nprocess through. Solomon Islands, for its part, has\nsigned a number of bilateral agreements with Papua\nNew Guinea, which will support the good work that\nhas already been undertaken towards peace.\nOn the issue of Palestine, my delegation\nsubscribes to the view that the resolution of the Middle\nEast conflict can only be possible through negotiations.\nIt is in this spirit that we call upon all parties to abide\nby the Quartet\u2019s road map for peace, and we urge a halt\nto all acts of aggression.\nTurning to the global fight against terrorism, the\nrecent terrorist attacks, especially in Iraq, Indonesia,\nand the Beslan school in southern Russia manifest the\ncontinuing menace and evil of terrorism at large. We\nhave witnessed many innocent lives, including those of\nwomen and children, being lost due to these senseless\nterror attacks. My delegation offers its deepest\ncondolences to those who have lost loved ones during\nthese unforgivable incidents. Solomon Islands\ncondemns in the strongest possible terms such acts of\nterror and fully support international efforts to combat\nthis scourge. In this regard, I wish to join others in\ncalling on the global community to support small\nStates to build their national capacities towards\nongoing efforts aimed at combating transnational\n16\n\ncrimes, such as arms smuggling, drug trafficking,\npeople smuggling, money laundering and terrorism.\nThe United Nations Charter promotes the\neconomic and social progress of Member States,\nespecially those facing special development problems.\nFor a country recovering from a post-conflict situation,\nSolomon Islands considers international frameworks\nsuch as the Brussels Programme of Action for the\nLeast Developed Countries, and the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for Small Island Developing\nStates as vehicles for enhancing peace and achieving\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Solomon Islands\nis a small island developing State and a least developed\ncountry, where its development challenges are\nmultifaceted in nature. Unfortunately, the level of\ninternational cooperation envisaged for the\nProgrammes either have not materialized or have been\nminimal. Despite this, my Government is undertaking\nreforms that include the appointment of a national\nfocal point for the Brussels Programme of Action.\nHence, we are hopeful that, with better coordination,\nSolomon Islands can take full advantage of and\nmaximize all opportunities the Programme has to offer.\nThe issue of debt-servicing continues to present\nchallenges, and even obstacles, to the development\nprogrammes of many poor developing States. Debt\nburdens continue to divert attention in national budgets\naway from the development of necessary\ninfrastructures and the delivery of basic and essential\nsocial services. Solomon Islands therefore calls on the\ninternational community to give greater attention to\ndebt issues.\nSolomon Islands attaches much importance to the\nMillennium Development Goals, and these have been\nmainstreamed into our NERRDP. While we will use the\n2005 high-level event mentioned in the Secretary\nGeneral\u2019s 2004 report on the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals to take stock of our\nprogress, we are confident that NERRDP can serve as a\nroad map for the medium to long-term implementation\nof our commitments. NERRDP provides a useful\nframework within which important issues, such as\neconomic and institutional reform, good governance,\nupholding of democracy and its values of freedom, and\nrespect for the basic principles of human rights can be\nnurtured and harnessed for the betterment and\nimprovement of the livelihood of our people and\nsociety, including the sustenance of peace in our\ncountry.\nSolomon Islands would like to pay closer\nattention to the emerging health threats it faces. In\nparticular, malaria remains the predominant cause of\ndeath of among children in Solomon Islands. The lack\nof data on HIV/AIDS presents a threat to the country\nand has the potential of creating a devastating impact\non its economy and social structure. With the support\nof WHO, the Global Fund to fight AIDS and Japan, we\nare determined to put in place appropriate preventive\nactions.\nSolomon Islands, which is geographically\nscattered across some 1,800 kilometres, comprising\nalmost 1,000 small islands and atolls, has an\nagriculture-based economy that is dependent on the\nenvironment. Sustainable management of resources is\nessential for guaranteeing the security of future\ngenerations.\nThe hurricanes that hit the southern United\nStates, the Bahamas, Grenada, Haiti and Jamaica in the\nCaribbean in the recent past; cyclone Heita, which\ndevastated Niue in 2003; flooding in Fiji; and\ncontinuous heavy rains in Solomon Islands all bring\nhome the stark reality of our world\u2019s vulnerability to\nnatural disasters. We realize the great difficulty and\npain that smaller island developing States face in\nmitigating the magnitude and impact of such disasters.\nTo this end, we extend our condolences and sympathy\nfor the loss of life and property caused by the recent\nhurricanes in Grenada and Haiti and would urge the\ninternational community to assist in relief efforts to\nthose who are affected.\nGenerally, Solomon Islands strongly feels that\nmore could be done by the international community\ntowards safeguarding our environment. Hence, we\nacknowledge the partnership of the Global Fund in\nassisting environmental programmes globally, and we\nwould encourage that the focus of further assistance\nshould extend to other sectors of sustainable\ndevelopment, such as energy, water and sanitation.\nMy delegation has closely followed the review of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action and the\ndevelopment of a Group of 77 strategy paper. While\nnegotiations are still ongoing, Solomon Islands, as a\nmember of the Alliance of Small Island States\n(AOSIS), acknowledges that the strategy paper\nstrengthens the Barbados Programme and places it as\nan action-oriented programme with which we can all\nidentify. We are hopeful the Mauritius meeting will\nrevitalize our efforts towards protecting the\nenvironment and enhancing sustainable development.\n17\n\nTrade remains a significant source of economic\ngrowth and development for many developing States.\nRegionally, Pacific island countries have gradually\nbegun the process of regional integration. South-South\ntrade cooperation among Forum island countries\nculminated in the entry into force of the Pacific Island\nCountries Trade Agreement last year, and the\nMelanesian Spearhead Group trade agreement is being\nreviewed with a view to further broadening its scope\nand its markets 10 years after its inception. The Pacific\nmembers of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific Group of\nStates are negotiating an economic partnership\nagreement with the European Union in the framework\nof the Cotonou Agreement. Those developments\nmanifest continuing preparations by small island\ndeveloping economies in the Pacific Islands Forum\nregion for gradual adaptation into the broader process\nof the globalization of the world economy.\nSolomon Islands notes that the eleventh session\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment, convened in June this year in S\u00e3o Paulo,\nbuilt confidence and consensus on ongoing multilateral\ntrade negotiations. Solomon Islands supports that\nprocess and urges making it more participatory and\ninclusive so that no one is left behind, especially the\nsmall and vulnerable island developing economies and\nthe least developed countries. We are mindful of the\nneed to recognize the inherent structural problems of\ngeographical size, isolation from markets and the\nconstraints resulting from a lack of supply-side\ncapacities and economies of scale, especially in the\ncase of small island developing States such as Solomon\nIslands. However, as a member of the World Trade\nOrganization, we are pleased that the Doha round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations embraces a development\ndimension, in particular the recognition of the principle\nof special and differential treatment, in its work\nprogramme on small island developing economies.\nOne of the principles of the United Nations\nCharter is to open membership to all States that accept\ntheir Charter obligations. The Republic of China on\nTaiwan has registered its interest in being part of the\nUnited Nations family. Solomon Islands once again\ncalls for the Republic of China to be made a full\nMember of the United Nations. Solomon Islands\nenjoys warm and cordial relations with the Republic of\nChina and is mindful of the threats facing the world\ntoday. Threats such as severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS) are transnational and transborder in\nnature and require the cooperation and engagement of\nall countries of the world. To deny one country the\nright to participate weakens global mechanisms and\njeopardizes the security of all.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan is democratic,\nand its vibrant economy is ranked seventeenth globally.\nIt has the third largest foreign exchange reserves. Its\ndevelopment experience offers important lessons on\nthe need to embrace freedom, respect for the basic\nprinciples of human rights, respect for freedom of the\npress and the uninhibited functioning of democratic\ninstitutions. The Republic of China\u2019s ability and\ncapacity to contribute to strengthening the United\nNations should be seriously considered, especially at a\ntime when the Organization could do with all the help\nit can receive.\nSolomon Islands calls upon the Assembly to find\na process that will allow the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to become a full and equal Member of the\nUnited Nations. The Pacific Islands Forum has a\nmechanism that engages both Chinas in our dialogue\nprocess, and we have continuously benefited from that\nrich interaction.\nTo conclude, I call upon the Assembly to get real\nand confront the increasingly varied and complex\nchallenges we face today. The purpose and the role of\nthe United Nations are ultimately to create a peaceful,\njust and prosperous world that offers hope to all. That\nrequires making the Organization flexible, innovative\nand responsive to ever-changing global demands. Thus,\nthe onus is on us to make bold and tough decisions that\nbreathe new life into our Organization."

        "file_text": "It is\na great pleasure to have Mr. Jean Ping presiding over\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I am\nconfident that his wealth of experience and the friendly\nties that his sisterly country enjoys with all countries of\nthe world will be a major asset for the Assembly as it\ndischarges its tasks.\nThe success of the present session will build upon\nthe accomplishments of the fifty-eighth session under\nthe leadership of the previous President, Mr. Julian\nHunte, who made an important contribution to the\nrevitalization of the role of the General Assembly in\nvarious fields.\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to enhance\nthe status of the Organization and to strengthen its role\nin the international arena, in particular in the area of\nregional and national development.\nAt the outset of the fifty-ninth session we must\nscrutinize the international environment in which it is\nbeing held. We have to consider world events to\ndetermine their direction, to decide where we stand on\nthem and to understand their impact, whether positive\nor negative, on the achievement of our shared goal: the\npromotion of international peace and security.\n18\n\nIndeed, we need to pause to see where this world\nand this international community are heading. Is it and\nare we ascending towards upholding the values of\ndemocracy, justice and the rule of law, or are we\ndescending into tyranny, the law of the jungle and the\nimposition of the policies of fait accompli? Can it be\nsaid that events in the world today emanate from a\ngenuine belief in the might of right, or do they, most\nregrettably, represent a consolidation of the arrogance\nof power?\nThe events witnessed by the world today are a\ncause of grave concern to all those who believe in the\ntenets and principles on which the international system\nwas established. We are witnessing the collapse of\nnoble values and the disintegration of principles once\nthought unassailable. National sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity are no longer sufficient to prevent\ninterference in the internal affairs of States. Indeed,\nthose internal affairs have themselves become pretexts\nfor those who wish to impose their policies on others.\nThe international situation forces us to consider\nthe critical question of what we seek from this world\nand what we have offered in return. We claim that we\nwant a world free from conflict and wars, but what\nhave we done to create such a world? We claim that we\nwant an international community governed by legality\nand the rule of law, as the Secretary-General said on\nTuesday, but are we seriously upholding the values of\nlegality and law? We claim that we wish to see all\npeoples enjoying democracy, but should States not\npractice democracy in the conduct of their foreign\nrelations as well?\nRelations among States are by nature volatile and\neasy to break, but they are reparable. It may be difficult\nat times to repair them, but the calculations pertaining\nto constantly changing interests will eventually make it\npossible to do so. Relations among peoples, however,\nare different. Their wounds are readily inflamed and\nheal slowly or hardly at all. It is therefore incumbent\nupon us, in our feverish attempts to achieve our own\ninterests, to take special care to avoid flashpoints\nbetween peoples, civilizations and cultures. Their\nmemories store all of their experiences and\ntribulations. Nothing stored in their collective memory\nfades or disappears with time.\nFor more than a decade now, Egypt has called\nand continues to call for the convening of an\ninternational conference under United Nations auspices\nto consider the phenomenon of terrorism and to agree\non means to combat it through effective collective\ninternational efforts. Proceeding from our belief in the\nimportance and centrality of the role of the United\nNations in the coordination of international efforts to\ncombat terrorism, as exercised through the General\nAssembly and the Security Council, we propose that\nthe Assembly establish an open-ended working group\nto consider proposals to increase the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the United Nations and its ability to\nachieve international anti-terrorism goals. That could\nbe accompanied by the convening of regional\npreparatory meetings to catalogue regional needs and\nareas conducive to international cooperation, which\ncould in turn ultimately lead to the adoption at an\ninternational summit of a draft comprehensive\nframework convention to combat terrorism.\nI should like to take this opportunity to describe\nthe situation in our part of the world and the threats\nand challenges it faces.\nThe main threat to the Middle East flows from\nthe continued acquisition by some of nuclear weapons.\nWhile we all agree on the dangers posed by those\nweapons and on the need to halt their proliferation as\none step towards eliminating them and freeing\nhumanity from the threat they represent, the\ninternational community continues to address the\nquestion of weapons of mass destruction selectively.\nWhile the international community seeks to impose a\nstrict system to monitor the imports of all Member\nStates within the non-proliferation regime \u2014 which,\nincidentally, includes all Arab States \u2014 it turns a blind\neye to the ongoing stockpiling of nuclear capabilities\nby one party in the region.\nI invite all to question whether it is acceptable for\nthe threat of nuclear proliferation to continue to loom\nover the Middle East. I leave it to all to decide whether\nthe international approach to the question is fair or is\none of double standards; whether it is capable of\naddressing those dangers and threats, or whether we\nare in need of urgent radical change. The ongoing\napplication of double standards will not only\nexacerbate the risks of nuclear proliferation and\nweaken the belief in the credibility and centrality of the\nrelevant international regime, but also aggravate the\ntense situation in the Middle East. In order to ease that\ntension and to avert those dangers, in 1990 President\nMubarak launched the Egyptian initiative to create a\n19\n\nzone free from weapons of mass destruction in the\nMiddle East.\nIn the year that has elapsed between the opening\nof the fifty-eighth and the fifty-ninth sessions, the\nsuffering of the Palestinian people has continued. The\nPalestinian people has been subject to acts of\naggression and its legitimate rights have continued to\nbe violated. The tragedies visited upon Palestinians\nhave become a permanent item of newscasts and\nnewspaper headlines. A new report emerges every day\nof the demolition of homes, the destruction of\ninfrastructure, the targeting of unarmed civilians,\nassassinations, collective punishments, and the\nimposition of curfews and closures. There is no end in\nsight to such policies. All this suffering has been met\nby an inexplicable international silence, with the\nexception of some timid expression of dissatisfaction\nor, at best, displeasure at events unfolding there. Such\nresponses entrench, rather than change, the situation of\nfait accompli.\nIsrael also continues to build the separation wall\non Palestinian lands. The wall separates students from\ntheir schools, workers from their factories and farmers\nfrom their fields. Had Israel\u2019s objective in the\nconstruction of the wall truly been to ensure its own\nsecurity, it would have built it on its own land. The\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice\ndeclared the wall\u2019s construction illegal and called for a\nhalt to construction activities and for the removal of\nthe sections already constructed. The opinion sent a\nstrong message to the international community in\ngeneral, and to Israel in particular, to the effect that the\ntorch of justice still burns bright. It may have seemed\nto flicker, but it has not been extinguished. The scales\nof justice still prevail. They may seem to have been\nupset, but they have neither fallen nor been tipped.\nOur region needs the construction of bridges that\nconnect, not walls that separate. Our region needs a\nchannel for the hopes for a promising future, not\nbarriers that hold the region captive to the past and its\ntribulations. Our region needs the serious action and\nsincere cooperation of all in order to dislodge the\npolitical peace process from its current impasse and put\nit back on track.\nThe way out of this bloody dilemma is well\nknown. It was laid down by the international Quartet in\nthe road map that enjoys the support of the entire\ninternational community. The ultimate destination of\nthat path is also well known. It was enunciated by\nUnited States President George Bush in his vision of\nthe establishment of two independent States, Palestine\nand Israel, living side by side in peace and security.\nThat is the road before us; those are its landmarks\nand its goals. There is neither time for waiting nor\nroom for foot-dragging. Prompt and effective action is\nneeded to break the cycle of violence, to restore calm\nand to resume the process of political negotiations.\nSuch negotiations are the one and only way to end the\nArab-Israeli conflict.\nIn that regard, Israel\u2019s intended withdrawal from\nthe Gaza Strip could be a significant step. If the\nwithdrawal takes place in a rational, disciplined and\norderly manner, it could enable us to begin to\novercome the crisis and to put the peace process back\non track. However, if it is carried out in an attitude of\nstubbornness and short-sightedness, it will lead only to\ntension and further violence.\nIn order to achieve the goal of an Israeli\nwithdrawal, a number of elements must be ensured. In\nparticular, the withdrawal must take place as an\nintegral and clear part of the road map, and it must be\nfull and complete. The withdrawal must include all\ncrossing points, the seaport and the airport; otherwise,\nit will be just another way to impose a blockade on and\nconfinement of the Palestinian people. A complete\nIsraeli withdrawal means not only the departure of\noccupation forces from the Gaza Strip, but also an end\nto the policy of incursions, raids and assassinations,\nwhich must be followed by a withdrawal from all the\noccupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank.\nDespite all the efforts and appeals for peace, the\nbloodshed continues unabated in the Middle East. We\nhad pinned our hopes on the transfer of sovereignty to\nthe Iraqi people at the end of June and on the formation\nof an Iraqi Government and National Council. It was\nhoped that those would be the first steps towards the\nrestoration by the Iraqis of their full sovereignty on\ntheir own national soil and towards ending the foreign\npresence in that long-suffering country. However, the\nevents of recent months and days have shown \u2014 and\ncurrent events continue to show every day \u2014 that the\nIraqi people continue to live in conditions that are far\nfrom stable.\nWe wonder whose interests are served by the\nevents in Iraq. Who is to benefit from the destruction\nof that country, with its age-old civilization? Will the\n20\n\nevents taking place in Iraq remain confined to that\ncountry, or will they spread beyond its borders like\nfire, causing destruction and desolation in the region as\nthey have done in Iraq?\nWe call upon all parties to respect Iraq\u2019s\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. The people and the\nState of Iraq desperately need a breathing space for\ncalm reflection on the best way to bring the country out\nof the devastating spiral of violence. We call upon the\nUnited Nations to continue its pivotal role in helping\nthe people of Iraq to rebuild their constitutional and\nlegislative institutions as a first step towards the\nrebuilding of Iraq by the Iraqis themselves.\nMoreover, there is an urgent humanitarian\nproblem in Darfur \u2014 indeed, a real humanitarian\ntragedy that requires urgent international action to\ncontain it. But is it inevitable that such an effort take\nthe form of interference in the Sudan\u2019s internal affairs\nand violation of its sovereignty? Can we not provide\nhumanitarian assistance and relief to Darfur\u2019s\ninhabitants without encroaching upon the Sudan\u2019s\nnational sovereignty? Are there enough military forces\nin the world to be dispatched as invaders to every area\nthat is afflicted by a humanitarian crisis?\nThe affairs of the Sudan, with its ethnic\ncomposition and its religious and cultural heritage, are\nby nature complex. It is our duty to help solve those\ncomplex and difficult problems, not to make them\nmore so.\nThe Sudan has signed, with the United Nations, a\nframework for cooperation to solve the problem in\nDarfur and to ensure humanitarian access to the\ncivilians in the region. That augurs well for the early\nalleviation of this humanitarian tragedy, which\nthreatens to have dire consequences for the entire\nregion. We call upon the international community not\nto confine itself to criticizing one party or another and\nnot to lay the blame on one set of policies or another.\nWhat is more important and useful is serious action to\nhelp the Sudanese people to overcome the crisis.\nEgypt believes that, in order to effectively face\nthe challenges and threats to international peace and\nsecurity, we must improve the working methods of the\nUnited Nations. Therefore, we have participated\nseriously \u2014 and will continue to do so \u2014 in the\nexercise of strengthening and revitalizing the United\nNations and its organs. It is our hope that that exercise\nwill be comprehensive, balanced and transparent and\nthat it will be carried out in full respect for the\nmandates that established the various organs of the\nUnited Nations. In that context, we need to reaffirm the\nneed to revitalize the role of the General Assembly and\nto ensure respect for and implementation of its\nresolutions by establishing an effective follow-up\nmechanism.\nI now turn from the wider context of United\nNations reform to the most sensitive reform issue:\nreform and expansion of the Security Council. The\nsensitivity of that issue clearly stems from the\nCouncil\u2019s increasing role in international affairs and its\neffect on many vital interests and on the international\nbalances of power.\nHere, I should like clearly to state Egypt\u2019s\nposition, which is based on our membership in the\nGroup of African States and the fact that we have the\nhonour to coordinate the Non-Aligned Movement\n(NAM) working group on this issue. Egypt hopes that\nthe deliberations on this subject will result in both\nreform of the Council and expansion of its\nmembership. The United Nations and the international\ncommunity as a whole will not gain much if the\nprocess is limited to expanding the Council\u2019s\nmembership without truly improving its working\nmethods so that it can better represent the general\nmembership of the Organization and have greater\ncapacity to maintain international peace and security.\nEgypt is fully committed to the Declaration of the\n1997 Harare Summit of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), which affirmed Africa\u2019s right to two\npermanent seats and three non-permanent seats on an\nexpanded Security Council. We are also committed to\nthe positions of the Non-Aligned Movement with\nregard to increasing the membership of the Council to\nat least 26 member States. Such an expansion could be\nconfined to the non-permanent category should the\nexpansion of both membership categories prove\ndifficult.\nWhat about the composition of the Council? We\ncall for guaranteed representation of all cultures and\ncivilizations in an expanded Security Council on the\nbasis of the current geographical distribution in the\nUnited Nations. We believe that the Council will not be\nable to effectively carry out its duties in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security unless\nit is more aware of the nature and circumstances\nprevailing in all societies and of the cultural and\n21\n\nhistorical heritage on which they base and formulate\ntheir policies.\nHere, we must reaffirm the legitimate right of\nmore than 1 billion Muslims and more than 300 million\nArabs to be represented in the Council on an equal\nfooting with those who represent other cultures and\ncivilizations. In that context, I wish to recall the\nsignificant contributions made by Egypt at the regional\nand international levels and its central role in the\nAfrican, Arab and Islamic spheres. Also noteworthy is\nEgypt\u2019s role in the Middle East and among developing\nand emerging economies. As a founding Member of the\nUnited Nations, Egypt has made well-known\ncontributions to the implementation of the purposes\nand principles of the Organization and to United\nNations peacekeeping operations. Egypt also played a\npivotal role in establishing the League of Arab States,\nthe OAU, the African Union, NAM and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. In addition, I\nwish to recall that Egypt possesses the components of a\nregional Power in its comprehensive sense, be it\neconomic, military or human. Egypt also enjoys social\nand political stability. Its diplomatic outreach is among\nthe largest, and over the years it has developed strong\ninternational ties throughout the world.\nEgypt has in the past expressed its conviction that\nit is eminently qualified to assume the responsibility of\na permanent seat in an expanded Security Council, on\nthe basis of the Harare Declaration. We reiterate that\nthe considerations to which I referred demonstrate that\nEgypt is clearly eligible, and has the capacity, to take\non the responsibilities of membership of the Security\nCouncil, in accordance with Article 23 of the Charter.\nWe believe that such membership could be based on a\nsystem of rotation with our African brothers, whereby\nwe would fill the additional seats that would be\nallocated to our continent, in accordance with any\nnewly established status in the Council and with the\ngeographic distribution as would be worked out by the\nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "Fifty-nine years ago the\nUnited Nations was established by nations determined\nto work collectively to find alternatives to conflict as a\nmeans of resolving disputes and to create a stable,\nsecure and more just and prosperous world. Devastated\nand exhausted by world war for the second time within\n25 years, nations put their faith in multilateralism and\nin this body in order to avoid future wars. The name\n'United Nations' evoked the unity of humankind, in\nwhich our shared needs and common humanity were\nmore important than our differences.\nIt is obvious as we consider the world today that\nwe have achieved that vision only in part. Yes, world\nwars have been avoided. International covenants have\nset out universally agreed human rights standards\nagainst which the performance of governments can be\nmeasured. International law has been developed and\nstrengthened. As Kofi Annan emphasized this morning\n(see ), putting the rule of law into effect at\nhome and internationally is essential to achieving a\nfair, just and civilized world. Cooperation has achieved\nadvances in meeting social, economic and\nenvironmental needs.\nBut much more remains to be done. War, more\noften within than across the boundaries of States, has\ntaken the lives of tens of millions of people since 1945,\nmost of them civilians. Weapons of mass destruction\nhave accumulated and access to them has spread to\nmore countries. New diseases such as HIV/AIDS have\nemerged, with devastating consequences. The gap\nbetween rich and poor countries has widened, not\ndiminished.\nThis year the Secretary-General's High-Level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change will put\nforward proposals for reforming and strengthening the\nUnited Nations, aimed at ensuring its relevance and\neffectiveness in addressing these issues. It is critical\nthat we seize this unique opportunity to institute\npositive reforms and not squander it by adopting\nnarrow, self-interested and inflexible responses. Nor\nwill a lowest-common-denominator approach achieve\nwhat we all require.\nReform is long overdue. The composition of the\nSecurity Council cannot go on reflecting the world as it\nwas in 1945. An expanded Security Council and reform\nof outmoded electoral groupings is necessary for the\nCouncil to be representative of the international\ncommunity as it is today. Those changes will\nstrengthen the Council\u00eds mandate and enhance its\ncredibility as the pre-eminent organ of the United\nNations. No solution, of course, will satisfy the\nviewpoint of every Member nation. A willingness to\ncompromise on a package of proposals will be\nessential. But clearly, enhancing the representation of\nareas such as Asia, Latin America and Africa must be\nan objective, and account must be taken of the\nsignificant contributions to the United Nations of\nnations such as Japan.\nWhile the High-Level Panel will focus on reform\nof the United Nations and security considerations,\ndevelopment goals to create a fairer world and promote\neconomic and social progress in the developing world\nare further vital considerations for the United Nations\nin the year ahead. For hundreds of millions of people,\nstarvation, disease and poverty are more immediate\nthreats than the concerns others of us have about\nterrorism and security.\nWe are now at a turning point in achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals. Improving the quality\nand quantity of development assistance is crucial.\nHowever, real and lasting progress to meet\ndevelopment challenges is also dependent on building\na fairer, more open and equitable global trading\nsystem. Countries of the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) spend\n$360 billion each year on subsidizing agricultural\n47\n\nproduction in a way that excludes opportunities for the\ndeveloping world to export - not only to OECD\ncountries, but to third markets as well. That sum\ndwarfs the amount the OECD countries provide in\ndevelopment assistance.\nNew Zealand welcomes the progress made at the\nWorld Trade Organization General Council meeting in\nGeneva in July, which put the Doha Development\nAgenda back on track. Agriculture is at the heart of the\nround; the European Union and United States\nagreement to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies\nis particularly welcome.\nThe United Nations must also adapt itself to the\nchanging nature of security and humanitarian concerns.\nThe concept of national sovereignty being paramount\nand standing in the way of international intervention in\nlocal conflicts cannot be sustained. As the Secretary-\nGeneral has challenged us,\n'if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an\nunacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should\nwe respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica - to\ngross and systematic violations of human rights\nthat offend every precept of our common\nhumanity?' (A/54/2000, para. 217)\nThe International Commission on Intervention\nand State Sovereignty concluded two and a half years\nago that sovereign States have the responsibility to\nprotect their own citizens from avoidable catastrophe:\nfrom mass murder and rape, from starvation. When\nthey are unwilling or unable to do so, that\nresponsibility must be borne by the broader community\nof nations.\nWe are today witnessing a humanitarian and\nhuman rights catastrophe in Darfur. The World Health\nOrganization reports that up to 10,000 people a month\nare dying or being killed. The very young and the\nelderly are most vulnerable.\nA few days ago, by its resolution 1564 (2004), the\nSecurity Council resolved to support an enlarged\nAfrican Union monitoring mission, demanded that all\nparties cease all violence and human rights violations\nand threatened further steps against the Government of\nthe Sudan if it fails to disarm the militias and protect\ncivilians.\nWithin the General Assembly, countries must\nwork together in a united and determined way to\nenforce those provisions and prevent the tragedy that is\nunfolding. History will not forgive those who stand in\nthe way of protecting 1.5 million refugees in that\nregion and allowing them to return safely to their\nhomes. It is also important that those responsible for\nthe mass murders and the abuse of human rights there\nbe held to account for their actions. There must be no\nimpunity for such crimes.\nThat is true in Darfur, and is also true of those\nresponsible for the destruction of East Timor and the\nmurder of people there in 1999. The ad hoc tribunals in\nIndonesia have failed to bring to justice those who are\nresponsible. That failure can only encourage such\npeople to commit further atrocities, believing that they\nwill never be held responsible for their actions.\nNew Zealand welcomes the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court and the role that it will\nnow play in dealing with genocide, war crimes and\ncrimes against humanity. It urges all countries which\nhave not yet done so to accede to the convention\nestablishing that body and to recognize its jurisdiction.\nIn the area of conflict resolution, we face today\ntwo major challenges: in Afghanistan and in Iraq. New\nZealand has strongly supported efforts to bring security\nand stability to Afghanistan. As a small country we\nhave contributed more than NZ$80 million in military\nand development assistance. We welcome progress\ntowards presidential elections next month and the\nessential democratic mandate that they will provide to\nthe Government.\nStrong international support, however, will be\nnecessary to meet the challenges which lie ahead. That\nincludes ending the production and trading of drugs.\nAfghanistan provides about 75 per cent of the world\ntrade in opiates. The money derived funds warlords\nand organized crime and undermines the ability of the\nlegitimate Government to function.\nNew Zealand deplores the violence in Iraq, which\ncontinues to harm or take the lives of so many people,\nand the circumstances which have contributed to that\nviolence. We call on those responsible for taking the\nlives of innocent people to end their violence. They\nnow have access to a political process which they\nshould use to promote their views and interests. A\ncredible election process is vital to creating an Iraqi\nGovernment which has a popular mandate. The United\nNations has a key role to play in that process, but\nadequate security and a safe environment are first\nnecessary for that to occur. New Zealand will continue\n48\n\nto support the interim Iraqi authority and the United\nNations in their efforts to restore security, peace and\nprosperity to the Iraqi people, who have suffered for so\nlong.\nIn Iraq and elsewhere, close attention also needs\nto be given to the protection of United Nations staff.\nThe General Assembly this year will consider an\nintegrated security strategy for the United Nations,\nwhich will incorporate a system-wide review of the\nUnited Nations security apparatus, accountability and\nresources. The Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel must be\nstrengthened and supported by all States Members of\nthe United Nations.\nNew Zealand condemns all acts of terrorism and\nwill continue to contribute strongly to the campaign\nagainst terrorism. In particular, we condemn the\ninhumanity of terrorists in Beslan who sacrificed\nchildren as pawns in pursuit of their political\nobjectives. However, attempts to suppress terrorism by\nforce will not by themselves be enough unless we also\naddress the causes which drive people to support,\nfinance or be recruited into terrorism.\nIn that regard, no action will be more important\nto the undermining of terrorism today than finding a\njust and sustainable solution to the conflict between\nIsrael and the Palestinian people. The international\ncommunity must work with those countries to\novercome the failure of leadership, the lack of resolve\nand the cycle of violence and retaliation which stand in\nthe way of solving that conflict.\nFinally, in the Pacific region, New Zealand's own\nneighbourhood, we can celebrate the progress which\nhas been made in Bougainville and in the Solomon\nIslands in ending conflict and re-establishing the rule\nof law. In both cases, a concerted regional response\nwith the support of the United Nations has been\neffective. In Bougainville, that response created peace\nfrom a situation where a 10-year civil war had resulted\nin widespread devastation and the loss of thousands of\nlives.\nIn the Solomon Islands, the intervention of the\nRegional Assistance Mission has restored the rule of\nlaw by its elected Government in place of the anarchy\ncreated by armed militias. More than 3,500 weapons\nhave been collected and destroyed, social services and\na credible budgetary progress restored and militiamen\nand corrupt elements from the police and Government\narrested and charged.\nMuch however, remains to be done to meet the\nwide-ranging challenges which confront the Pacific\nregion, including environmental threats, ethnic\nconflict, poor law enforcement and governance and the\nthreat of disease. Regional solutions are being applied\nby the Pacific Islands Forum through greater\ncollaboration and integration in addressing problems.\nInternational cooperation through processes such as the\n10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of Action\nset to take place in Mauritius next year will also help.\nIn conclusion, 59 years from the end of the\nSecond World War and the establishment of the United\nNations, the world continues to face major challenges\nto its security and well-being. The opportunity exists\nthis year for us to consider and improve the ways by\nwhich the Assembly can address the problems faced by\nhumanity and make a difference. Success or failure to\ndo so will be the collective responsibility of all of us."

        "file_text": "On behalf of my\ndelegation, the people of Uganda, and on my own\nbehalf, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Jean Ping,\nfrom the sister African Republic of Gabon, upon your\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session. I have every confidence in your\nstewardship in steering the session to a successful\nconclusion.\nI thank the Secretary-General for his excellent\nleadership, especially during these trying times for the\nUnited Nations. I note with satisfaction that, after a\nyear in which the centrality of the United Nations in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security has\ncome under serious challenge, there seems to be a\nreturn to the more widely accepted multilateral\napproach to resolving global challenges.\nTerrorism continues to be one of the biggest\nthreats to international peace and security. Since\n11 September 2001, thousands of innocent people,\nincluding women and children, have been killed or\nmaimed as a result of indiscriminate terrorist acts. This\nyear, the world has witnessed many innocent civilians\nmassacred in cold blood, hostages beheaded in the\nmost barbaric manner, children mutilated by suicide\nbombers and terrorist groups, very often in the name of\nextremist and misguided causes and ideologies.\nWhether it is the recent appalling attack on school\nchildren in the Russian town of Beslan, or the massacre\nof civilians in Balonyo in northern Uganda, the\nintention of terrorists is the same: to undermine and\ndivide our societies, overthrow elected Governments,\nand to strike at the heart of international peace and\nstability.\nThe Uganda delegation condemns those terrorist\nacts in the strongest terms. We do not accept that any\ncause, however genuine, warrants the indiscriminate\ndestruction of human life or property.\nIn Uganda, we have been fighting against a\nterrorist organization known as the Lord\u2019s Resistance\nArmy, based in southern Sudan. That organization has\nkilled, maimed and abducted tens of thousands of\nUgandan children in the northern part of Uganda. The\nacts of plunder and destruction by those criminals have\nlaid to waste entire villages and driven helpless\nvillagers into camps for internally displaced persons.\nThe Government of Uganda is sparing no effort, with\nthe cooperation of the Government of Sudan, to end\nthat situation and restore peace and stability in this\narea. We are confident that soon the remnants of those\nterrorists will have been eliminated or captured.\nDespite amnesty legislation and a standing offer of\npardon by our President, very few have responded.\nHowever, recently some improvement in reporting has\nbeen observed.\nUganda welcomes the recent restoration of\nsovereignty to the Iraqi people. We call upon the\nUnited Nations, in particular, and the international\ncommunity as a whole, to do everything possible to\nassist the interim Government in the rehabilitation of\nIraq and re-establishment of the physical and political\ninfrastructure to allow the holding of scheduled\nelections in that country.\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine, often\ndriven by rigid positions, continues to pose a serious\nthreat to peace and stability in the Middle East. Uganda\nsupports the Quartet-led road map for a comprehensive\npeaceful settlement in the Middle East. We support the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State existing side-by-\nside and in peace with Israel within secure and\nrecognized borders, in accordance with relevant United\nNations Security Council resolutions.\nAfter more than 50 years of violence and\nbloodshed, both the Israelis and Palestinians must\nrethink their positions. New, creative approaches to a\ncomprehensive peace should therefore be sought for\nthe sake of their peoples. Every year we adopt\nresolutions which remain mere paper. Resolutions are\nnot solutions in themselves; it is high time we engaged\nconstructively in the serious search for a solution, for\nthe future of humanity and the Middle East.\nTurning to the Great Lakes region, we note with\nsatisfaction the positive developments with regard to\nthe peace processes in various conflict situations. In\n31\n\nBurundi, the transitional Government has been\nconsolidated with almost all the fighting groups\nsubscribing to the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation\nAgreement for Burundi. We call upon the groups still\nremaining outside the peace settlement to cease their\nmilitary operations and join the peace process. We\ncongratulate the African peace mission for its\ncontribution to the peace process and we welcome the\ndeployment of United Nations peacekeepers to\nBurundi. Election dates may change, but the elections\nmust be held sooner or later. Elections, a new\nGovernment and good proposals relating to the\nquestion of representation \u2014 all must work for peace\nfor Burundi. It is therefore important that the\ninternational community extend the necessary\nassistance for the consolidation of peace, stability,\nrehabilitation and development of Burundi.\nUganda remains committed to supporting the\npeace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n(DRC). We urge all parties in the Government of\nNational Unity in Kinshasa to remain committed to the\nPretoria Peace Agreement and to resist any temptation\nto resume hostilities. We also call upon the Security\nCouncil to strengthen the United Nations Organization\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n(MONUC) under Chapter VII of the Charter to\nconsolidate its peacekeeping operations. A robust\nMONUC force would be critical for the enforcement of\nSecurity Council resolution 1493 (2003) on the arms\nembargo against militias, as well as the disarmament,\ndemobilization, rehabilitation, resettlement and\nreintegration of all armed rebel groups and militias\noperating on the territory of the DRC. That would also\nserve to reduce, and hopefully to eliminate, inter-ethnic\nclashes in the eastern Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and help to reassure neighbouring countries\nabout cross-border security. It may also be important to\ninclude other legitimate groups in the Government of\nNational Unity and Transition in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo in order to enhance peace. We\nbelieve that before democratic elections are held it is\nimportant to create a consensus for peace and security.\nUganda believes that as a result of the positive\nachievements in the peace processes in Burundi and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo there is an urgent\nneed to convene the international conference on the\nGreat Lakes region under the auspices of the United\nNations and the African Union. The conference, which\nis scheduled to take place in Dar es Salaam, United\nRepublic of Tanzania, in November 2004, will bring\ntogether a core group of the Great Lakes countries and\nthe neighbouring countries affected by the conflicts or\nthose that, by infection, contribute to them.\nIn order to consolidate the peace efforts, we hope\nthat the Great Lakes regional conference will involve\nall stakeholders in the development of a strategic plan\nof action on the key issues, including regional peace\nand security, development, post-conflict reconstruction\nand regional integration in the context of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). I am\nglad to note that countries of the Great Lakes region,\nincluding Uganda, have already embarked on a\npreparatory process for the conference involving youth\nand women\u2019s groups, non-governmental organizations\nand local government officials from all border districts.\nWe believe that this inclusive process will ensure\nnational ownership and commitment to the\nimplementation of the recommendations of the\nconference.\nThe delegation of Uganda welcomes the peace\naccords recently signed in Nairobi between the\nGovernment of Sudan and the Sudan People\u2019s\nLiberation Movement and Liberation Army (SPLM/A).\nWe hope that those accords will lead to the end of the\nlong-running conflict, which has caused untold\nsuffering to the people of the southern Sudan and led to\ninsecurity in neighbouring countries \u2014 particularly my\nown, Uganda. With the return of peace and stability in\nthe southern Sudan, we are confident that we will be\nable to bring to an end the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army\nattacks against our people in the northern part of\nUganda.\nMy country is an active participant in the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development initiative\nthat has brought the various factions in Somalia\ntogether to the negotiating table to end the conflict in\nthat country. We note with great satisfaction the\nprogress that has so far been made, and we salute the\npeople of Somalia for coming together to establish a\nParliament embracing all groups.\nIn 2005 the United Nations will observe the fifth\nanniversary of the Millennium Summit, where we\npledged our political will and commitment to a number\nof Millennium Development Goals, including the\nreduction of poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. It is,\ntherefore, of great concern that in many parts of Africa\npoverty levels are rising as per capita incomes continue\nto decline and that infant and maternal mortality rates\nare on the increase, while official development\nassistance commitments remain unfulfilled.\n32\n\nIn order to make progress in meeting the\nMillennium Development Goals and ensuring the\nequitable sharing of the benefits of globalization, the\nGeneral Assembly should focus on the following, inter\nalia: effective follow-up to and implementation of the\nvarious plans of action, declarations and strategies\nrelating to the Monterrey Consensus on financing for\ndevelopment, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation\non sustainable development, the Brussels Declaration\nand Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries and the Almaty Programme of Action on\nlandlocked developing countries; restructuring of the\nglobal trading system, especially in agriculture, mode 4\ntrade in services and increasing value-added export\nproducts from the developing countries; mobilization\nof adequate resources to fight malaria, tuberculosis and\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, covering prevention, care\nand research and development to ensure the provision\nof cheaper and more effective drugs and possibly the\ndiscovery of an HIV/AIDS vaccine; strengthening of\nSouth-South cooperation, including measures by the\nmore advanced developing countries to open their\nmarkets to products from the least developed countries;\nand stronger international support for NEPAD, which\nreflects Africa\u2019s priorities to address development,\ngovernance and the security challenges facing the\ncontinent. Critical support areas will include market\naccess, measures to encourage increased foreign direct\ninvestment in African countries, higher levels of\nofficial development assistance for infrastructure and\nhuman resources development, ensuring sustainable\ndebt levels, regional integration, enhancement of the\nAfrican Union\u2019s capacity to deal with conflict\nsituations and implementation of the African Peer\nReview Mechanism.\nAs the United Nations approaches its sixtieth\nbirthday in 2005, the need for revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly and restructuring of the Security\nCouncil has never been greater. The need for reform of\nthe United Nations is imperative if we want to enhance\nthe role of the Organization and the effectiveness of\nmultilateralism to address emerging hard threats such\nas terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and\ngenocide, as well as other challenges, such as\npersistent poverty and HIV/AIDS. It is therefore fitting\nthat the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change will be discussed in 2005.\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council,\nthe restructuring should reflect the need for\ndemocratization and ensuring a balanced and equitable\ngeographical representation. We believe that Africa\nshould be allocated no less than two permanent and\nfive non-permanent seats in the expanded Security\nCouncil.\nIn summary, Uganda is calling for stronger\ncollective action against international terrorism and\nsupport for the post-conflict rehabilitation and\ndevelopment programme in northern Uganda. We have\nnoted the positive developments in the Great Lakes\nregion and stressed the importance of convening the\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region in\nDar es Salaam in November 2004. We have highlighted\nthe significance of 2005 \u2014 as the both the sixtieth\nbirthday of the United Nations and the fifth\nanniversary of the Millennium Summit \u2014 as a key\ntime to focus on meeting the Millennium Development\nGoals and the revitalization and restructuring of the\nUnited Nations to enhance the role of the Organization\nand to ensure the effectiveness of collective\nmultilateral action."

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset,\nMr. President, to hail your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I would\nalso like to extend to you our best wishes for success in\ncarrying out your mandate, a mandate which reflects\nthe honour bestowed on your country, the Republic of\nGabon, by the international community.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nKofi Annan, for his selfless commitment to the causes\nof the United Nations and of Africa in particular.\nI believe this is also an appropriate time to pay\ntribute to and commend the actions of the former\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte,\nfor his considerable contribution to promoting the\nuniversality of the United Nations.\nMy country, the Republic of Cape Verde, is\namong the small island States. We believe that our\nStates, as a result of their specific characteristics,\ndeserve a special hearing from the international\ncommunity. In the economic, social and ecological\nspheres, those States are confronting shortcomings and\nrestrictions specific to them, and these must be duly\ntaken into account.\nThrough its own efforts, but also through the\nnecessary contribution of the international community,\nCape Verde is now preparing to better itself and its\ncondition as a least developed country (LDC). My\ncountry continues to suffer from a precarious situation\nwhich cannot be ignored or minimized. In addition, the\nsmall island States often represent unique physical and\nhuman realities which form a genuine heritage of\nmankind. For these and other reasons, I would like here\nto launch an appeal in favour of the small island States.\nThe international community is going through a\nparticularly complex period marked by challenges of\nmany kinds. We are aware that it is only by focusing on\npeace, stability, security, dialogue and respect for\ndiversity of interests and cultures, in an atmosphere of\nfreedom, that we can create an international\nenvironment conducive to the just settlement of the\nserious problems we are encountering today.\n2\n\nWar does not have to be inevitable. Moreover,\ngiven the very advanced stage of civilization which\nmankind has achieved, I think it would be relevant to\nask whether it is time to leave behind the concept\nformulated by the outstanding nineteenth-century\nGerman military theoretician Clausewitz, who stated\nthat war is a continuation of policy through other\nmeans. I think, rather, that it is by relying on\nnegotiations, dialogue and the acknowledgement of the\nlegitimacy of the interests and rights of all parties, that\nwe can tap the potential for avoiding the need for war\nas a means of resolving national or international\ndisputes.\nFinally, it is with respect for international law,\ndrawn up with the participation of all and equally\nshared and respected by all \u2014 a respect which\npermeates the principles and purposes of the United\nNations \u2014 that we can find a response leading to a\npeaceful, prosperous and just world: the world which\nmankind clearly wishes to see.\nI would like to reiterate here and now our\nabsolute rejection of the unwarranted use of violence\nand our unequivocal condemnation of the use of\nterrorism as a way of resolving political disputes. The\ntrivialization of life and death, which is utterly\ncondemnable, also dehumanizes its proponents and\nopens the way to the worst kinds of wrongs in relations\nbetween human communities. This is why the struggle\nfor peace cannot be halted, and why everyone,\nespecially the United Nations, has the imperative duty\nto contribute to breaking the cycle of violence and\nopening the way to peaceful coexistence among nations\nand human communities.\nAmong the other social ills afflicting our planet\nwhich can be effectively combated are hunger and\npoverty. Their eradication is in fact one of the\nobjectives of the Millennium agenda. I am convinced\nthat success in combating hunger and poverty will have\nunquestionably positive global effects that would\npromote unity and harmony within the human family,\nand would strengthen human rights, including the most\nsacred and vital right \u2014 the right to life. It would also\npromote the material and moral enrichment of all of\nhuman society. It would contribute to the creation of\nconditions that are a prerequisite for improving\ninternational security by lessening migration and\nbridging the gap between rich and poor, thus\neliminating the reasons for the frustration of millions\nof poor and hungry individuals throughout today\u2019s\nworld.\nAnother tragedy that requires action is HIV/\nAIDS, which is mortgaging the future of many\ncountries, particularly in Africa. There is an urgent\nneed to advance and guarantee effective international\nsolidarity in order to root out from the daily lives of\nmillions of human beings the spectre of hunger,\npoverty and pandemic illnesses. It is my belief that\nmankind has the resources and potential which will\nallow us to realize this marvellous dream.\nThe African continent, of which my country and\nyour country, Mr. President, are a part, continue to be\nfaced with enormous and varied challenges. Regarding\nthe critical issue of peace and political stability, we\nalso note a genuine commitment on the part of African\nStates to resolve conflicts and eliminate hotbeds of\ntension. But the political will of States, regional\norganizations and the African Union is not enough, and\nthe international community\u2019s commitment and its\nindispensable contribution in the form of adequate\nresources are necessary for peace and security to\nbecome a reality for all our peoples within a reasonable\nperiod of time.\nPeace is not merely the absence of war. Genuine\npeace requires sufficient time and confidence-building\namong parties, as well as a strategy for building peace.\nSo too, peace and stability within States require\ninstitutions and policies that are inclusive and that\nrespect and engage all sectors of nations and meet their\nlegitimate political and economic aspirations, while at\nthe same time ensuring the protection of their cultural\nidentity.\nThere can be no doubt that, owing to profound\nchanges in the scientific, technological and socio-\npolitical fields, a huge movement of democratization of\nhuman societies is under way, backed by the\ninstitutions of the rule of law. However, mere political\ndemocracy is not sufficient. The ordinary citizen must\nbe guaranteed participation in public affairs and a\ndecent, worthy and dignified life, since there can be no\nfreedom without dignity.\nIt must also be recognized that there are still\ntenuous vestiges of the old orders, which must once\nand for all be rooted out and eliminated from\nrelationships between individuals and communities,\nsuch as racism, religious and cultural discrimination,\n3\n\ngender inequality, and scorn for the fundamental rights\nof indigenous human communities in various countries.\nWe must also ask whether democracy within\nStates is reflected in relations among States,\nparticularly when we note the existence of an\nimbalanced world in which the inequality of power\nbetween the haves and the have nots continues to grow\nday by day. Therefore, there is a critical need to\npromote the democratization of international relations\nby seeking better balance in relations among States.\nInternational democracy based on dialogue and\ncooperation among States and among cultures, on\ntolerance and respect for cultural diversity among\ncommunities and on human solidarity and respect for\nthe legitimate political and material interests of all\nparties, of nations large and small would show itself in\nthe implementation of genuine multilateralism in\nglobal governance. Herein undoubtedly lie the\nfoundations for triumph over today\u2019s challenges and\nthe assurance of a safe, peaceful, predictable and\nprosperous future for humanity.\nIn several months, the United Nations will mark\n60 years of rich and intense life that has been filled\nwith challenges, upheavals and extremely complex\nproblems, but that has also been marked by\ninnumerable victories and hopes for humanity. My\ncountry joined the community of nations in large part\nbecause of the intervention of the United Nations to\npromote the freedom and human rights of colonial\npeoples, for which we shall always be grateful. I\nbelieve that, in the light of the profound changes that\nhave occurred over the past six decades in all areas of\nthe international arena and the emergence of a new\nbalance of forces and extremely complex challenges\nrequiring urgent and immediate responses, it is\nbecoming clear that we need to move forward with\nreform of the United Nations, particularly the Security\nCouncil. In my view, the planned reform should, in\naddition to reflecting new global geopolitical realities,\nguarantee representativity and appropriate intervention\nand participation for all continents and all\ncommunities. From that perspective, we would then\nhave a more balanced international community and a\nmore equitable sharing of responsibility in the building\nof humanity\u2019s future.\nBefore concluding, I should like to highlight the\nsuccessful actions carried out in the past few years by\nthe United Nations under the leadership of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has enabled\nus to keep on the international agenda substantive\nissues that confront many societies daily, which has\nenabled this universal institution to be in direct contact\nwith concerns and challenges that are worrisome to all\nmembers of the human family.\nHere, I should also like to honour the memory of\nall those who have served the United Nations and\nfallen victim to senseless acts resulting from\nintolerance and the terrorism of radical movements. I\nemphasize the need for all countries and all formal and\ninformal institutions to guarantee and respect the\nsecurity of such noble men and women, for they are on\na mission to serve all of us.\nI hope, Sir, that this fifty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, which is taking place under your\npresidency, will provide new gains for peace, justice,\nsocial progress and global stability.\nFinally, I should like to reiterate the words of\nPope John Paul II, the unquestionable moral authority\nof our time, in his appeal to world leaders on 1 January\nthis year:\n\u201cThe United Nations ... needs to rise more and\nmore above the cold status of an administrative\ninstitution and to become a moral centre where\nall the nations of the world feel at home ...\u201d"

        "file_text": "In\nexpressing to you, Sir, our great pride at seeing an\neminent representative of the Group of African States\npreside over the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession, I wish to offer you, on behalf of\nMr. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, President of the Togolese\nRepublic, and of the Government and the people of\nTogo, which it is my great honour to represent, our\nsincere wishes for your success in fulfilling your\nmandate.\nWe also congratulate Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan on his dynamic and unequivocal work at the\nhead of our Organization.\nThe present session of the General Assembly is\nbeing held at a time when international peace and\nsecurity continue to be seriously threatened, requiring\nour common Organization fully to shoulder its role and\nmission with even greater determination and bolder\ninitiatives. Indeed, we are living in a world of\nprecarious balances arising from our collective\ninability to establish genuine peace and shared well-\nbeing in the framework of international legitimacy.\nIn Africa, the legitimate aspirations of people to\nlasting peace, in particular in those countries and\nregions where that peace is being sorely tested, have\nyet to be achieved.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, after numerous short-lived\nhopes have been dashed, the implementation of the\nAccra III Agreement remains today the sole hope for\nthe restoration of peace and stability in that country.\nThe Togolese Head of State, who from the very\nbeginning of the crisis committed himself to the path of\ndialogue and reconciliation, will continue to be\ninvolved in the peaceful settlement of that fratricidal\nconflict.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nrecently arisen obstacles to the peace process, which is\nintended to lead to the holding in 2005 of elections for\nthe creation of new institutions, have required the\ninternational community to spare no effort in\nmaintaining the gains won through the costly\ndeployment of the United Nations Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and in\nlaunching, whenever necessary, such operations as\nArtemis to nip in the bud any impulse towards a\nresumption of combat wherever it may arise. The\nGovernment of Togo therefore unreservedly supports\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposal significantly to\nincrease the number of MONUC personnel.\nIt is to be hoped that the international conference\non peace, security and development in the Great Lakes\nregion, to be held in November, will be the appropriate\nframework for finding lasting solutions to the problems\nof insecurity and instability that continue to weaken\nrelationships among States of the region and to\njeopardize the emergence of a climate of good-\nneighbourliness and mutual understanding.\nIn the Sudan, regarding the tragedy unfolding in\nDarfur, the international community must urgently\nassist the Government of that country and the Sudan\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army/Movement to consolidate the\npeace process through the signing of the\ncomprehensive peace agreement. In that regard, the\ninternational community must provide consistent\nsupport to the African Union\u2019s peace operation.\nIn Burundi, Liberia and Somalia in particular, the\noutburst of solidarity and renewed interest which the\ninternational community continues to show in the\nrestoration of peace and the recovery of those\ncountries, battered by long years of war, should be\naccompanied by more adequate financial and logistical\nassistance. Togo, for its part, will continue to\ncontribute to conflict and crisis resolution in Africa\nand to support the various United Nations\npeacekeeping operations by supplying military\ncontingents or observers, as it is currently doing in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Burundi, Liberia and Haiti.\nThe prevailing situations in the world,\nparticularly in Iraq and the Middle East, are a source of\nmajor concern. In Iraq, the restoration of full\nsovereignty to the Iraqi people and the recognition that\nthe United Nations has an important role to play in\nrebuilding the country should give every element of\nIraqi society the opportunity to work with resolve to\n11\n\nbuild a stable and prosperous country free of all\nviolence.\nIn the Middle East, the ongoing escalation of\nviolence between the State of Israel and the Palestinian\nState may definitively compromise the continuation of\nthe peace process and the implementation of the\nvarious agreements that have been signed. In that\nrespect, the international community and the Quartet\nmust strive to persuade the two protagonists to avoid\nunilateral action and to return to the negotiating table\non the basis of the road map and the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council.\nFurthermore, we wish to emphasize, again with\nrespect to crisis issues, that post-conflict situations\nclearly demonstrate the importance of providing\nadequate financing, not only for humanitarian\nassistance but also for other vital programmes to\npromote peace and sustainable development. There is\nthus a need for the financing of disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration programmes for ex-\ncombatants and other long-term instruments for\nensuring peace \u2014 such as education, health care and\njob creation for young people \u2014 to be made a priority\nof post-conflict peace-building.\nIn the same context, the troubling financial\nsituation of the three Regional Centres for peace and\ndisarmament call for more attention from the Assembly\nif they are to enjoy the financial resources necessary to\nfulfil their mandates harmoniously. In that regard, and\non the basis of the relevant Secretary-General\u2019s reports,\nthe delegation of Togo firmly believes that it is high\ntime for the General Assembly seriously to review the\nfinancing of the Regional Centres in order to provide\nthem with adequate financial resources under the\nOrganization\u2019s regular budget. In so doing, the General\nAssembly would demonstrate its genuine support for\nthe Organization\u2019s goals in the area of arms control and\ndisarmament and its appreciation of the active role\nplayed to date by the Centres. For its part, my country,\nwhich hosts the United Nations Regional Centre for\nPeace and Disarmament in Africa, will do its utmost to\nensure the Centre\u2019s continuity and long-term viability.\nTerrorism is the other major danger of our times\nbecause it continues seriously to threaten our States\nand is thus a scourge in the face of which failure to act\neffectively means giving way to the forces of evil.\nHaving endured terrorism in the past, Togo once again\ncondemns the heinous terrorist attacks perpetrated\nrecently around the world and keenly hopes that more\ndecisive action will be undertaken to eradicate that\ndisease of the human conscience.\nFrom that perspective, while it is up to each State\nto take the measures necessary to strengthen security\nwithin its own borders, we must strive above all to\nenhance regional and international cooperation among\nStates and to ensure that the poor States can enjoy\nadequate assistance in the implementation of effective\nnational mechanisms to combat terrorism.\nEconomic and social development is a corollary\nof peace and security. We all recall that, at the dawn of\nthe twenty-first century, the Millennium Summit was\nconvened here in this very Hall. Following the Summit,\nat which the problems of poverty and development\nwere debated, the heads of State and Government\nadopted the Millennium Declaration, an unprecedented\naffirmation of international solidarity in which the rich\nand poor countries together undertook firm\ncommitments whereby they forcefully reaffirmed their\nwill to reduce by half, by the year 2015, the proportion\nof the world\u2019s population touched by poverty. World\nleaders voiced the hope at that time that other major\nmeetings also held early in the new millennium would\nserve as a framework for the birth of genuine\npartnership between the countries of the North and\nthose of the South.\nSeveral years later, however, we note with regret\nthat the Millennium Development Goals have been\nhard to achieve. Indeed, the necessary resources to\nfinance sustainable development and to combat poverty\nand hunger in the developing countries have not been\nmobilized and, contrary to expectations, only a small\nnumber of developing countries have been able to\nmake progress in the elimination of poverty.\nThe critical economic situation in Africa requires\na collective awakening and introspection. What has\nhappened to our myriad commitments? What has\nhappened to our many promises?\nRegarding the rules of international trade, which\nremain unfavourable to the poor countries; regarding\nthe long-awaited debt relief; regarding the fact that the\ngoal of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product for\nofficial development assistance has been met by only a\nsmall fraction of donor countries, we may well ask\nourselves what happened to the solidarity so loudly\nproclaimed at the Millennium Summit.\n12\n\nLast year\u2019s failure of the World Trade\nOrganization trade negotiations in Canc\u00fan \u2014 designed\nto settle the critical issues of eliminating agricultural\nsubsidies and providing access to the markets of the\nindustrialized world for the products of the countries of\nthe South \u2014 highlighted yet again the North-South\ndivision and evoked real fears for the future of the\nmultilateral trade system.\nOn the basis of those questions and concerns, the\ndelegation of Togo reaffirms the need for all\ninternational partners to reflect in deeds the political\nwill they proclaimed at the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\nSustainable Development so as to give new impetus to\nefforts to increase official development assistance, to\nprovide debt relief and equitable access to markets, to\nprotect the environment, and to combat malaria,\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.\n2005 will be a crucial year for our Organization.\nIndeed, in 2005, we shall engage in in-depth\nconsideration of the implementation of the Monterrey\nConsensus. In 2005, we shall hold a high-level debate\non the implementation of the Declaration of\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS. In that regard, we need to\nbear in mind that the twenty-sixth special session of\nthe General Assembly set specific goals to be met for\n2003 and 2005 towards the eradication of HIV/AIDS\npandemic.\nAbove all, 2005 will be the year of the high-level\nplenary meeting to engage in a comprehensive review\nof progress made in the implementation of all of the\ncommitments undertaken in the Millennium\nDeclaration and at the major United Nations\nconferences and summit meetings in the economic and\nsocial fields.\nWe therefore await those meetings with interest.\nThey will give us the opportunity to reaffirm our\npolitical commitment to building a world of greater\nsolidarity and prosperity in order to give hope once\nmore to that significant segment of the world\u2019s\npopulation that lives on less than $1 a day, suffers from\nhunger and malnutrition and has no access to drinking\nwater.\nThe peace and economic and social development\nthat we desire for our countries cannot be achieved\nwithout the effective participation of peoples in\nmanaging public affairs. Democracy in Togo, based on\na multi-party system and the rule of law, has become a\nvibrant reality, inter alia, through the adoption of\nimportant legislative and administrative texts and the\nestablishment of virtually every institution provided for\nby the Constitution. With faith and determination, the\nGovernment of Togo, under the impetus of the Head of\nState, is striving to build a genuinely democratic\nsociety that also takes the sociological realities of our\ncountry into account.\nIn order to complete its task, the Government has\ndeclared its openness to any constructive contribution\nfrom the national political class and civilian society, as\nwell as from our development partners. In that context,\non 14 April it opened consultations with the European\nUnion, in conformity with article 96 of the Cotonou\nAgreement of partnership linking that organization to\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. At\nthe outset of the consultations, the Government\nendorsed a number of commitments whose\nimplementation is currently near completion and\nshould ultimately lead to a better foundation of\ndemocratic culture and the consolidation of the rule of\nlaw.\nThe Government intends to strive to bring the\nconsultations to a successful conclusion, the ultimate\nobjective of which is the resumption of cooperation\nbetween the European Union and Togo. The political\nzeal of the Togolese authorities \u2014 reflected in the\nimplementation of an ongoing inclusive national\ndialogue; the adoption of a press and communications\ncode; the drafting of an improved electoral code and a\nfinancing law for political parties; and the decision\ntaken by the Head of State on 11 August to release\nmore than 500 common-law prisoners \u2014 is a guarantee\nof the Government\u2019s resolve to create favourable\nconditions for the citizens of Togo to enjoy their\nfundamental rights, and in particular their political and\neconomic rights.\nWe take this opportunity to launch an urgent\nappeal to all our development partners to assist the\nGovernment of Togo in the process of strengthening\nand consolidating democracy and the rule of law.\nI cannot conclude without returning to the\nrecurrent issue of United Nations reform. The\nGovernment of Togo wishes to propose that bold\ndecisions be taken at this session to accelerate the\nprocess of reform of the system, and of the Security\nCouncil in particular, so that the issue can be more than\na mirage. Indeed, the numerous challenges confronting\n13\n\ntoday\u2019s world require a strengthened and more\neffective Security Council, which only a more\nrepresentative and more democratic membership can\nensure. In that respect, Africa deserves an appropriate\nplace within that vital United Nations body.\nThe Security Council must therefore be enlarged\nin both the permanent and non-permanent memberships\nso as to meet the democratic requirements of our times\nand to allow various groups of countries to provide\ntheir valuable assistance in achieving the objectives of\nour Organization, which include peace and security,\nworking for freedom and democracy, guaranteeing\nglobal prosperity through free and equitable\ninternational trade, preserving a healthy environment\nand creating stable international relations based on\ndialogue. If we truly seek to achieve all this, we must\ngive our common Organization the resources\ncommensurate with doing so.\nMay this session serve to strengthen cooperation\namong our States and peoples and assist us in\nconsolidating peace and in achieving security and\nlasting development for all."

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all,\nto congratulate the President on his assumption of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. I am fully confident that his wisdom and\ndiplomatic skills will guide our deliberations to a\nfruitful outcome. I would also like to take this\nopportunity to convey my appreciation to Mr. Julian\nHunte for his able leadership and contributions to the\nsuccess of the previous session. My delegation would\nalso like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his\nselfless dedication to the cause of the United Nations.\nThe world today faces many daunting challenges.\nMost ominous and threatening among them are issues\nrelated to peace and security. Under those\ncircumstances, it is worth recalling the Five Principles\nof Peaceful Coexistence, which were enunciated 50\nyears ago by Myanmar, along with China and India, to\nprovide the basic principles for inter-State relations.\nThe Principles were subsequently adopted by Asian\nand African leaders in the Bandung Declaration of\n1955. The 1961 Belgrade Conference of the Non-\nAligned Movement also adopted the Principles as basic\ntenets of the Movement. The United Nations itself\nendorsed the Principles. Founded on the premise of the\nessential unity of humankind, the Five Principles\nremain as relevant and valid today as on the day they\nwere proclaimed.\nMyanmar considers the United Nations, which\nrepresents international legitimacy and near-universal\nmembership, as the sole multilateral forum for\naddressing urgent global issues. Recent events remind\nus of the futility of unilateralism and the danger of\nresorting to the use of force without the authorization\nof the United Nations.\nThreats to the international system and the\nrapidly evolving international situation demand a\nthorough reform of the Organization and its\nmechanisms, structure and working methods. In that\ncontext, we would like to reiterate our views on the\nreform of the Organization, including that of the\nSecurity Council. The expansion and reform of the\nSecurity Council must be an integral part of a common\npackage. If it is to become more representative and\nreflect contemporary political and economic realities,\nthe Council should be expanded in both categories of\nmembership. An ideal solution in the democratization\nprocess would be the abolition of the veto. Until that is\ndone, its application should be limited. It is also our\nview that new permanent members of the Security\nCouncil should enjoy the same rights and privileges as\ncurrent members.\nMyanmar notes with interest the ongoing work of\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change.\nIn this highly globalized world, regional\ncooperation, including South-South cooperation, can\nwell complement international cooperation. As a\nmember of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations, Myanmar is actively involved in the\nAssociation\u2019s activities aimed at promoting regional\n13\n\npeace, stability and prosperity and at enhancing\ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.\nTerrorism is one of the most serious challenges\nthat the world faces today. It threatens national\nsovereignty and violates human rights, including the\nright to life. Last year, terrorists carried their war to the\ndoorstep of the United Nations. They cruelly\nextinguished the lives of 22 innocent persons,\nincluding that of Special Representative Sergio Vieira\nde Mello, at United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\nMore recently, we have seen wanton acts of terrorism\nin diverse parts of the world, from Beslan to Jakarta to\nMadrid. Myanmar unequivocally condemns terrorism\nin all its forms and manifestations and joins the\ninternational community in calling for concerted action\nto combat the menace in accordance with the United\nNations Charter and international law.\nWe have never permitted the use of our territory\nfor hostile acts against any State. We have neither\nprovided assistance to those involved in terrorist acts\nnor safe haven to them, and we never will.\nMyanmar is doing its utmost to combat this\nmenace at the national, regional and international\nlevels. Myanmar has signed, or acceded to, 11 of the 12\ninternational legal instruments related to the\nsuppression of terrorism. It is also actively involved in\nthe Bali Process to combat transnational crime,\nincluding international terrorism.\nThe illicit trafficking in drugs is another\nchallenge that is closely linked to other transnational\ncrimes. Success in the war against drugs will contribute\nto a successful outcome in the fight against\ntransnational crime. Myanmar accords topmost priority\nto the suppression and eradication of narcotic drugs. A\n15-year national plan is targeted at the eradication of\nnarcotic drugs in the country by the year 2014. In the\nlast decade, Myanmar seized and destroyed drugs\nvalued at more than $14.5 billion.\nFigures from the United States Drug Enforcement\nAdministration show that over a span of eight years,\nfrom 1996 to 2003, poppy cultivation declined steadily,\nby 71 per cent, while opium production decreased by\n81 per cent. The United Nations Office on Drugs and\nCrime has acknowledged Myanmar\u2019s commitment to\nthe anti-drug campaign.\nIn recent years the problem of synthetic drugs has\nalso surfaced. The illicit drugs chain begins with\ninadequate control of the trade in precursor chemicals.\nIt bears repetition that my country does not produce\nprecursor chemicals used in the production of narcotic\ndrugs. We would like to urge countries that produce\nprecursor chemicals to institute effective regulatory\ncontrols. Without precursor chemicals there can be no\namphetamine-type synthetic drugs.\nMyanmar is determined in its fight against drugs.\nIt has established bilateral, trilateral, regional and\nmultilateral cooperation to rid the world of this\nscourge.\nSome Western countries allege that Myanmar is\nnot adequately addressing the issue of trafficking in\npersons. Nothing could be further from the truth. In\nfact, Myanmar views trafficking in persons as an evil\nthat must be suppressed through concerted action. In\nthat connection, Myanmar acceded to the United\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized\nCrime on 30 March of this year. A national law against\nhuman trafficking is being drafted in accordance with\nthat Convention. Next month, Myanmar will host the\nmeeting of the six-nation Coordinated Mekong\nMinisterial Initiative against Trafficking.\nAllegations of human rights violations in\nMyanmar are aimed at discrediting the Government for\npolitical purposes. Myanmar believes that the question\nof human rights is an important issue. It should be\naddressed with objectivity and impartiality, and\nwithout selectivity. Myanmar has consistently\ncooperated with the United Nations on human rights\nissues. In that context, a national Human Rights\nCommittee has already been established and human\nrights awareness is being introduced in school curricula\nnationwide, as well as through workshops.\nAn interview conducted by a politically\nmotivated non-governmental organization with 25 or\nso insurgents inside a neighbouring country became the\nbasis of a report that there are 70,000 child soldiers in\nthe Myanmar national armed forces. That is a far-\nfetched conclusion. The falsehood found its way into\nthe report of the Secretary-General on children and\narmed conflict in 2002 (S/2002/1299). The report\nsubsequently became the resource document in the\nSecurity Council\u2019s ensuing thematic debate on children\nand armed conflict.\nI wish, first of all, to firmly reiterate that\nMyanmar is not a nation in armed conflict. It is a\nnation at peace. Secondly, I wish to clearly state that\n14\n\nchildren not permitted to be recruited into the armed\nservices in Myanmar, either by law or in practice. A\npreventive programme was in place in my country even\nbefore Security Council resolutions were adopted on\nthis theme. In that regard, the Chairman of our\nCommittee on the Prevention of the Recruitment of\nChild Soldiers recently received the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) representative in Myanmar\nto explore ways and means to enhance cooperation.\nThe representative was afforded the opportunity to visit\nthe army recruitment centre near Yangon, and\nsubsequently the army recruitment centre in Mandalay\ntogether with the United Nations Resident Coordinator.\nMyanmar is finalizing an action plan and is\ncooperating with UNICEF in that regard. It will also\ncontinue its cooperation with the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children\nand Armed Conflict.\nAllow me to turn to developments in my country.\nPeace and stability have been restored. We are taking\nsteps to ensure a smooth transition to a peaceful,\ndemocratic modern State. Myanmar places the highest\npriority on national reconciliation to achieve unity\namong its 135 national races. In order to strengthen ties\nand promote the economic and social development of\nthe national races inhabiting the border areas, the\nGovernment has expended 58 billion kyats and more\nthan $550 million in infrastructure development that\nincludes communication networks and education and\nhealth facilities, thus promoting the quality of life of\nthose citizens.\nNotwithstanding the unilateral sanctions of some\nWestern countries, Myanmar has been able to develop\nits economy and promote the well-being of its people.\nWe have achieved this by relying mainly on our own\nresources, and with the assistance and cooperation of\nour neighbours.\nNoteworthy advances have been made in the\nhealth and education sectors. The country now has 757\nhospitals, with 140 hospitals having been added in the\nlast 15 years. In the past year alone, 22 new hospitals\nwere commissioned. Over the same period, the number\nof colleges and universities in the country has\nincreased from 32 to 154. Enrolment has risen\ndramatically in those institutions, from 120,000 to\n890,000 students.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nAllow me now to turn to recent political\ndevelopments in my country. In August 2003, the\nPrime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, announced a\nseven-step road map for transition to democracy. The\nroad map has been well received in the country, as well\nas by our neighbours. The Association of Southeast\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Summit last November\nwelcomed the commitment of the Myanmar\nGovernment to effect a transition to democracy.\nThe first and most crucial step of the road map,\nthe reconvening of the National Convention, was taken\non 17 May of this year. The current Convention is\nbeing attended by 1,088 delegates from eight strata,\nrepresenting all walks of life. It is more inclusive than\nthe previous Convention, which was attended by only\nabout 700 delegates.\nMoreover, 60 per cent of the delegates to the\ncurrent Convention are from the national races. Over\n100 delegates represent 17 major armed groups and 17\nsmaller armed groups, which have returned to the legal\nfold. In the previous Convention, representatives of\nthree or four armed groups which had just returned to\nthe legal fold were present as observers.\nDuring the first session, the sensitive issue of\npower-sharing between the central Government and the\nstates and regions was the main focus of discussion.\nIndeed, power-sharing is a vital and delicate issue, as\nthe country is now evolving from a unitary\nGovernment structure to a union structure, where states\nand regions will have their own executive and\nlegislative bodies. Delegates held extensive discussions\non that issue. Because of the complex and sensitive\nnature of the deliberations, discussions were time-\nconsuming and sometimes intense. After a successful\nfirst session, the Convention adjourned on 9 July.\nMyanmar is a union of 135 national races, and\nunity is key to achieving our vision of a prosperous\ndemocratic State. We are greatly encouraged by the\nresults of the first session. The common desire to\nensure the success of the seven-step road map was\nevident. Preparations are under way for the second\nsession, which is to be convened in the forthcoming\nopen season. Once agreement is reached on the\nfundamental principles in the National Convention, a\nnew constitution will be drafted. The draft text will be\nput to a referendum for the people of Myanmar to\ndecide upon. After the adoption of the new\n15\n\nconstitution, there will be free and fair elections, in\nwhich the people will elect leaders of their choice.\nThe new political structure needs to be strong and\nresilient, and the country united. The future of the\nnation cannot be determined by one individual or one\nparty acting alone. There is no alternative to the\nNational Convention. It is the sole process through\nwhich the aspirations of the people of Myanmar to\nestablish a modern and democratic nation can be\nfulfilled. We cannot allow the National Convention to\nbe derailed under any circumstances. Failure would\nplunge the nation into the abyss of anarchy. That is the\nreason why we set such store on the successful\noutcome of the National Convention. We are\ndetermined that this vital national endeavour will be\ncrowned with success."

        "file_text": "Sir, let me begin by\ncongratulating you on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, and let me\n20\n\nsay how honoured I am to be one of your Vice-\nPresidents.\nI want to say also how delighted Australia is to\nwelcome Iraq back to the General Assembly.\nWe, the nations of the world, gathered here at the\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, face\nchallenges to international security and prosperity that\nare very different from those which existed at the birth\nof the United Nations. However, the aims of the United\nNations as set out in the Preamble to the Charter\nremain as relevant and vital today as they did then:\n\u201cto save successive generations from the scourge\nof war \u2026 to reaffirm faith in fundamental human\nrights ... to establish conditions under which\njustice and respect for the obligations arising\nfrom treaties and other sources of international\nlaw can be maintained \u2026 and to promote social\nprogress and better standards of life in larger\nfreedom\u201d.\nToday, the menace of terrorism and the dangers of\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\ncast their shadow across the globe, threatening not only\nour security, but also the development gains and future\nprosperity of all nations.\nIt is this new international environment, this new\nreality, to which we must all adjust. The United\nNations is no exception. The United Nations is a vital\ninstitution that does great humanitarian work, but it\nmust strengthen its capacity to deal effectively with the\nproblems we now face or risk sliding into irrelevance.\nThe Secretary-General himself recognized this\nlast year when he said that we have come to a fork in\nthe road, a moment no less decisive than in 1945 when\nthe United Nations was founded. And, again this year,\nhe stated that if the leaders of the world could not\nagree on the way forward, history would take the\ndecisions. The issue he raises for us all is whether we,\nthe United Nations membership, can rise to the\nchallenge and take the steps necessary for the\nOrganization to fulfil its aims in today\u2019s world.\nAustralia strongly supported last year the\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of a High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and we\nstand ready to contribute to ambitious outcomes. I want\nto return to the work of the Panel later in this address.\nThere would be few nations in the room\nuntouched by terrorism. As the cowardly attacks in\nBeslan and at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta\nillustrate, terrorism will not simply fade away. In\nresponse, we, the international community, cannot\nallow security threats to fester. What is required is new\nthinking, practical action, and cooperation between\nGovernments. Obviously, the United Nations has a\nprimary role to play. But Governments and regional\norganizations must also ensure that their resources and\ninfrastructure can respond to the current environment.\nThis is a responsibility Australia has taken very\nseriously. On terrorism, we have fully supported the\nwork of the United Nations, ensuring Jema\u2019ah\nIslamiyah was listed as a terrorist organization under\nthe Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) sanctions\nregime and promoting compliance with the United\nNations terrorist asset freezing regime.\nWe have committed energy and resources to\nbuilding counter-terrorism cooperation in our own\nregion, both bilaterally and through organizations such\nas the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the\nRegional Forum of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations. We are also committed to building\nunderstanding as part of a comprehensive approach.\nThis is evident in the messages we convey to our\nregional partners and to Australians \u2014 namely, that our\nefforts to stop a minority of extremist Muslim terrorists\nis not a war on Islam; that Muslims are as much the\nvictims of terrorist attacks and must defend\nthemselves; and that we must all work to defeat\nterrorism together.\nOur cooperation with regional partners has\ndelivered results, but as the recent bombing in Jakarta\nillustrates, terrorism in our own region is not yet\ndefeated. While Australia\u2019s embassy in Jakarta may\nhave been the target of the latest attack, it was as much\nan assault on Indonesia as on Australia, and we are\nparticularly saddened by the loss of innocent\nIndonesian lives. Indonesia and Australia are\ndetermined to catch the perpetrators and see justice\ndone, for the bonds between us cannot be split by\nterrorists, but only strengthened.\nAustralia\u2019s commitment to a stable and secure\nregion is particularly reflected in our efforts in the\nPacific. Since 11 September 2001, we have come to\nappreciate more acutely the dangers weak and failing\nStates can pose to security. Of course, not all such\n21\n\nStates are home to terrorists, but where instability and\nvulnerabilities exist, so, too, do opportunities for crime\nand the potential for human suffering.\nWhen our Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer,\naddressed this forum last year, he noted Australia was\ndeveloping regional approaches to confront the dangers\nof State failure and that with our Pacific Islands Forum\npartners we were restoring hope to the people of\nSolomon Islands. In just one year, the Regional\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands has made\nexcellent progress in restoring stability and law and\nconsolidating Government finances, and is now\nmoving into long-term governance reform.\nAustralia is also working with other States in our\nregion, notably Papua New Guinea and Nauru, to\naddress economic management and governance issues.\nRegional cooperation is being strengthened through the\nPacific Plan, an initiative of the recent Pacific Islands\nForum meeting in Apia, which seeks to enhance\ncollaboration in areas of governance. I am delighted to\nsee among us today the Secretary-General of the\nPacific Islands Forum and welcome him to this Hall.\nWe would encourage the High-level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change to outline ambitious\nproposals for effective collective action to address\nfailed and failing States, including more explicit\nprovision for action by regional and other plurilateral\narrangements, as set out in Chapter VIII of the Charter.\nIraq is at a critical moment in its political\nevolution. A small minority is bent on destruction and\nmurder and wants to deny the Iraqi people their\nopportunity to express their political will through\nelections. This minority also attacks those who are\nworking to rebuild Iraq\u2019s economy and improve Iraqi\nlives. Increasingly, Iraqis themselves will be\nresponsible for doing that work, but success will\ndepend on the resolute support of the international\ncommunity.\nWe cannot allow terrorists to disrupt the\ndemocratic process in Iraq. Prime Minister Alawi has\nemphasized his Government\u2019s determination to hold\nelections in January 2005 and the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General in Iraq has\ntold the Security Council that maintaining the election\nschedule is his greatest priority. While the difficult\nsecurity conditions in Iraq cannot be denied, it is\nimperative that the United Nations fulfil its role under\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004) and work with\nIraqis to complete arrangements for the elections on\ntime.\nThe size of the United Nations presence in Iraq\nmust be commensurate with the importance and\nurgency of its task. For its part, Australia remains\ncommitted to assisting Iraq transform itself. To this\nend, we have committed more than $125 million, much\nof it directed through United Nations agencies.\nThe situation in Darfur is a humanitarian disaster.\nAustralia is committed to supporting urgent\ninternational efforts to end this horrific crisis. We have\nalready committed $20 million in emergency assistance\nfor the people of Darfur. We welcome the adoption of\nSecurity Council resolution 1564 (2004) and applaud\nthe African Union for agreeing to lead a mission to\nDarfur. Let me make this very clear: we stand ready to\noffer assistance to this mission. The situation in Darfur\nhighlights the need for the international community to\ndevelop a better framework for responding to\nhumanitarian crises, and we hope the High-level Panel\non Threats, Challenges and Change will come up with\nclear and workable recommendations on humanitarian\nintervention.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\n(WMDs) is another urgent concern. Unless we act\nfirmly and with unity, terrorist groups could one day\nacquire WMDs with disastrous consequences. As a\nthreat to international security, the issue of WMD\nproliferation falls squarely within the Security\nCouncil\u2019s mandate. We welcome the adoption of\nresolution 1540 (2004) as a demonstration of the\nCouncil\u2019s willingness to tackle WMD proliferation,\nincluding the risk of WMD terrorism. We hope that\nwith the adoption of this resolution, the Council will\ntake a firmer and more active stance on WMD issues.\nAs part of our commitment to combating the risk\nof nuclear terrorism, Australia will host an Asia-Pacific\nministerial conference in November on nuclear\nsafeguards and security. In addition, in the First\nCommittee this year, we, along with Turkey and\nArgentina, will introduce a draft resolution on the\nprevention of the illicit transfer and unauthorized\naccess to, and use of, man-portable air defence systems\n(MANPADS). We hope for a consensus adoption of\nthis draft resolution, which encourages States to take\nconcrete steps to prevent MANPADS from falling into\nthe hands of non-State end-users.\n22\n\nAllow me to return to the subject of the High-\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. During\nthis address, I have referred several times to\nit. Australia welcomes the direction of panel\ndiscussions \u2014 as far as we understand them \u2014 with\nrespect to both doctrinal and institutional reform. We\nhave contributed actively to the Panel\u2019s work and we\nencourage the Panel, in its remaining deliberations, to\nwork towards ambitious recommendations on its entire\nprogramme of work, including Security Council\nreform, addressing threats from WMDs and terrorism,\nhumanitarian intervention and effective collective\naction.\nOn the issue of structural reform, we note here\nthat Australia has advocated expanding the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council to make it more\ncompatible with geographical realities, through the\naddition of Japan, India, Brazil, an African country and\nIndonesia. Whatever the final shape of the Panel\u2019s\nreport, one thing is clear: high-level political\ncommitment will be crucial to bringing bold reform\nrecommendations to fruition. We would encourage all\nMember States to give the Secretary-General their full\nsupport in considering the Panel\u2019s recommendations.\nOne opportunity to do this will be the 2005\nUnited Nations summit of heads of State or\nGovernment. The summit provides an excellent forum,\nnot only to review implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, but also to endorse a reformed\nUnited Nations that is better equipped to deal with the\nchallenges it faces.\nAustralia has long advocated the need for United\nNations reform. Back in 2000 in this forum, the Prime\nMinister warned that,\n\u201cIn the absence of change and adaptation, the\nOrganization will wither as the nations of the\nworld bypass it in favour of ... mechanisms that\nare more relevant to their needs\u201d (A/55/PV.20,\np. 25).\nOf course, this warning was before 11 September\n2001, before coalition action in Afghanistan and Iraq\nand before the terrorist bombings in Bali, Jakarta,\nMadrid, Istanbul and many other locations. If the need for\nreform was pressing then, it is critical now. The High-\nlevel Panel provides the best prospect for repositioning\nthe United Nations system to meet contemporary\nchallenges. This is an opportunity we cannot waste if the\nUnited Nations \u2014 our Organization \u2014 is to retain a\nsubstantial role in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity in the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to\naddress the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly\nof the United Nations on behalf of the European Union\n(EU).\nWith its 25 member States, the European Union\nrepresents 13 per cent of the United Nations\nmembership and accounts for almost 30 percent of the\nworld\u2019s economy. Our contributions to the United\nNations go further; EU member States pay more than\n36 per cent of the United Nations regular budget and\nabout half of all voluntary contributions to the United\nNations Funds and Programmes. They contribute more\nthan 50,000 troops to United Nations-led and United\nNations-authorized international peace missions.\nWe in the EU are proud of our contribution to the\nUnited Nations and to international cooperation. But\nwe are not complacent. We understand that our security\nand prosperity are inextricably linked to the fate of\nothers, and we know that we cannot isolate ourselves\nfrom cross-border threats and challenges. We realize\nthat climate change does not respect nationality,\nethnicity or religion, that HIV/AIDS knows no borders\nand that terrorists kill indiscriminately. No nation can\nrespond to these threats in isolation; the only way\nforward is through collective action.\nIn a world of global threats, global markets and\nglobal media, our security and prosperity depend more\n28\n\nand more on an effective multilateral system. The\nsearch for a strong, rule-based international society is\nmore imperative than ever.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s call to work\nharder to strengthen the rule of law for all. His agenda\nis our agenda. That is why reform of the United\nNations, with a view to making it stronger, more\neffective and more efficient, is a high priority for the\nEuropean Union. The Union remains committed to\nmultilateralism and a rule-based international order,\nwith the United Nations at its core. What gives great\nstrength to the United Nations is its legitimacy. It has\nno substitute in the international community. It is\nunique. But the Organization must adapt to changing\ncircumstances. The reform efforts that have already\nbeen set in motion by the Secretary-General must be\nintensified and deepened with a view to making the\nUnited Nations stronger, more effective and more\nefficient.\nThe EU looks forward to the report of the High-\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and to\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s recommendations that will be\nsubmitted to the General Assembly. Next year, the\nGeneral Assembly will meet at the highest level to\nreview progress in honouring all of the commitments\nof the United Nations Millennium Declaration. The\nreview must be comprehensive, balanced and effective.\nThe summit must deal with the major, interlinked,\nconcerns of peace, security, poverty and sustainable\ndevelopment. The recommendations in the report of the\nWorld Commission on the Social Dimension of\nGlobalization are an important contribution to the\nreview.\nWe have committed ourselves to combating\npoverty and promoting sustainable development. The\nMillennium Development Goals must be achieved.\nUrgent action is called for. Both developing and\ndeveloped countries must put in place a range of\nmeasures, as agreed at the Monterrey Conference on\nFinancing for Development including: good\ngovernance; expansion of trade opportunities, in\nparticular for developing countries; and an increase in\nofficial development assistance. The European Union\nis committed to those objectives. It is very much on\ntrack for increasing its official development assistance\n(ODA) to 0.39 per cent of gross national product\n(GNP) in 2006 as part of a longer-term effort to raise\nits ODA contributions to 0.7 per cent of GNP.\nCombating HIV/AIDS must be an integral part of\nour global campaign against poverty. As one of the\nmost devastating pandemics in human history,\nHIV/AIDS is literally a disease of mass destruction: a\ndisease which strikes 10 people every minute. In Africa\nespecially, AIDS is tearing the fabric of society apart.\nFighting that disaster is a priority for us all.\nPrevention of HIV/AIDS is inextricably linked to\nsexual and reproductive health and rights. We wish to\nreaffirm our commitment to the agenda of the\nInternational Conference on Population and\nDevelopment and will do so again at the tenth\nanniversary commemoration on 14 October.\nReproductive health and rights are an essential part of\ndevelopment.\nOne of the greatest threats to international peace\nand security today is the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and their means of delivery. The\ninternational community must address that challenge\neffectively. The EU adopted a comprehensive and\ncoherent strategy against the proliferation of those\nweapons last December, covering a wide spectrum of\nmeasures. The EU is guided by the conviction that a\nmultilateral approach to security is the best way to\nmaintain international order. That is why we are firmly\ncommitted to uphold, implement and strengthen\nmultilateral disarmament and non-proliferation treaties\nand agreements. The multilateral treaty system\nprovides the legal and normative basis for all non-\nproliferation efforts.\nInternational treaty regimes and export control\narrangements are in place to prevent the spread of\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery\nsystems. Those instruments, however, have not\nsucceeded in putting a complete stop to proliferation.\nAdditional measures are necessary, in particular to\ncombat the risk of terrorist organizations gaining\naccess to those weapons and delivery systems. In that\nregard, the EU welcomes the adoption of Security\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004), which is fully in line\nwith the EU strategy.\nWith others, the European Union will also\nexplore the possibility of establishing a close\nrelationship between the United Nations and the Hague\nInternational Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile\nProliferation.\nTerrorism is another threat that can be dealt with\nonly by effective multilateralism and close\n29\n\ninternational cooperation. Terrorists\u2019 capacity to strike\nis still very substantial, as shown by the heinous\nattacks in several countries over the past year. I wish to\nreiterate that the European Union utterly condemns all\nterrorist acts, irrespective of their alleged motivations,\nand to express our profound solidarity with the victims\nof such acts.\nThe European Union welcomes the development\nof the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, which\nwill strengthen the ability of the United Nations to\noversee implementation of anti-terrorism resolutions\nand conventions. Obviously, the United Nations can do\nits work well only if Member States honour their\ncommitments and assume their responsibilities.\nEquipping the United Nations to deal with terrorism\nalso demands readiness to act in situations in which\nStates cannot or do not wish to implement their\ninternational obligations in the fight against terrorism.\nThis brings me to the issue of human rights \u2014\nanother common concern. Human rights lie at the core\nof the work of the United Nations. The European\nUnion fully agrees with Secretary-General Annan\u2019s\nstatement that terrorism must not be used as an excuse\nto trample on human rights. States must ensure that any\nmeasures taken to combat terrorism comply with their\nobligations under international law, in particular\ninternational human rights, refugee and humanitarian\nlaw. We must protect the universal values and\nfundamental freedoms whose enjoyment is seriously\nimpaired by acts of terrorism.\nThe European Union is a committed supporter of\ninitiatives to improve the implementation of human\nrights obligations worldwide and at country level. The\nEuropean Union recognizes the responsibility of the\ninternational community to protect mankind from\ngenocide, war crimes and grave and massive violations\nof human rights. The European Union welcomes the\nintroduction of a human rights-based approach in the\nwork of all United Nations agencies and programmes.\nThat will ensure that United Nations assistance\nactivities contribute to achieving such rights for\neveryone everywhere. Our own initiatives in that area\noften complement and strengthen those initiated within\nthe United Nations framework. We especially welcome\nthe close cooperation between the European Union and\nthe United Nations special mechanism in respect of\nchildren in armed conflict and human rights defenders.\nThe valuable work being done by the United\nNations, particularly by the Special Rapporteur on\ntorture, in pursuit of the prevention and eradication of\nall forms of torture, is strongly recommended and\nsupported by the EU. The European Union would also\nlike to take this opportunity to reaffirm its opposition\nto the death penalty.\nThe European Union stresses the importance of\nthe International Criminal Court in putting an end to\nimpunity and strengthening the rule of law throughout\nthe world. It will pursue its efforts to ensure the widest\npossible ratification of, and accession to, the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\nThe world needs a United Nations that can\nintervene decisively to prevent, limit and put an end to\nmilitary conflicts. An estimated 40 per cent of\ncountries emerging from civil wars relapse into conflict\nwithin five years. The lesson \u2014 familiar but often\nforgotten \u2014 is that the United Nations system must be\nbetter attuned to how such conflicts can be prevented\nand peace preserved. No matter how difficult,\npreventing conflict and preserving a precarious peace\nis less costly than intervening in a full-blown conflict.\nThe European Union is aware of its responsibility\nin that area and is increasing its capabilities to maintain\nits already significant contribution to conflict\nprevention, international crisis management and\npeacekeeping operations. It will also continue to assist\nother regional organizations to enhance their own crisis\nmanagement capabilities. The United Nations must\nintensify its cooperation with those organizations, in\npart with a view to enhancing their capacity for crisis\nmanagement, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the\nCharter. To that end, the European Union is working\nwith the United Nations Secretariat to implement the\nJoint Declaration on United Nations-EU Cooperation\nin Crisis Management of September 2003.\nSeveral regional issues warrant special attention.\nThe Middle East peace process must be put back on\ntrack. That means that the entire international\ncommunity must back the road map \u2014 the only road to\nan agreed negotiated two-State solution. The European\nUnion and its Quartet partners will remain engaged in\nthe search for a settlement. The European Union thinks\nthat the Assembly can make an important contribution\nto that objective by focusing on substantive issues in\nthe peace process and adopting a pragmatic and\nconstructive approach towards this problem.\n30\n\nThe Security Council\u2019s unanimous adoption of\nresolution 1546 (2004) marks the restoration of\nsovereignty to Iraq. The European Union\nwholeheartedly supports the political process and the\nnew Iraqi Interim Government and calls on all Member\nStates to do the same. It gives its full backing to the\nholding of democratic elections in January 2005. It is\ncommitted to unwavering support of the pivotal United\nNations role in that country. The Iraqi people have\nsuffered so much and deserve the chance to have a\nbetter life. Let us offer them that chance.\nIn a similar vein, the process of securing stability,\nreconstruction and democratization in Afghanistan\nmust remain an international priority. The Afghans are\ndesperate for peace. They demand a say in their\ncountry\u2019s future. Over 10 million Afghans, more than\n40 per cent of them women, have registered to vote in\nthe presidential elections on 9 October. There can be\nno better sign of their enthusiasm for democracy. The\nEuropean Union will continue its political and financial\nassistance to Afghanistan and its people.\nDevelopments in Africa are cause for both\noptimism and concern. Increasingly, Africans are\ntaking responsibility for solving the problems of their\ncontinent. The progress of the African Union in\nestablishing its architecture for peace and security is a\ncase in point. The European Union will use its African\nPeace Facility to help the African Union build capacity\nto engage in peace support and peacekeeping\noperations.\nThe European Union will closely cooperate with\nthe African Union, the United Nations, the Arab\nLeague and the United States with a view to\nharmonizing international efforts to contain and\nresolve the conflict in Darfur. It will continue to\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations, in particular\nby the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.\nThe European Union expresses its concern over\nthe recent increase in tensions in the Great Lakes\nregion and calls on all countries in the region to adhere\nto the Declaration of Principles on Good-Neighbourly\nRelations and Cooperation. It remains our conviction\nthat the resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes\nregion requires a regional approach. In the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, the European Union supports a\nmore focused and robust mandate of the United\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUC) and related\nincreased capabilities. It is actively examining different\noptions for continued support to United Nations efforts\nto strengthen MONUC.\nAlso, the European Union remains deeply\nconcerned about the situation in Zimbabwe and urges\nthat the Government of Zimbabwe establish the\nconditions for and hold free and fair elections in line\nwith the Southern African Development Community\u2019s\n(SADC) August 2004 electoral guidelines.\nMany courageous men and women are trying to\nmake a difference under the blue flag of the United\nNations. Last year\u2019s bombing in Baghdad was a tragic\ndemonstration of the fact that the work of the United\nNations is often dangerous. The European Union\nsupports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to improve the\nsafety and security of United Nations staff. We are\nkeen to discuss his proposals. Through our policies,\nactions, and resources, we, the Member States, bear the\nresponsibility of making it possible for the United\nNations to go where it should.\nThe European Union itself is an example of\nmultilateralism at work. Conflicting interests and\ndiverging views still exist within the European Union,\nas they do everywhere. But conflicts are resolved\nwithin the framework of common institutions and\nbinding rules. Multilateralism works. A rule-based\ninternational order is possible. And necessary. The\nEuropean Union will strive to achieve that goal\neverywhere."

        "file_text": "As the\nhead of Lebanon's delegation to the General Assembly,\nI am pleased to congratulate Mr. Ping on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. I wish him success in his presidency. I also\nwant to acclaim the special relationship that my\ncountry has with his and to express our gratitude for\nthe support which his country, Gabon, gives to our\nlarge Lebanese community working there and enjoying\nits hospitality.\nI also wish to thank his predecessor, Mr. Julian\nHunte, for his effective leadership as President of the\nAssembly at the fifty-eighth session.\nSecretary-General Annan has earned our respect\nand appreciation for the efforts he has made to further\nthe United Nations goal of working for a just, secure\nand peaceful world.\nIn past years, we in Lebanon used to come to this\nforum seeking United Nations help. The United\nNations has always come to our support, adopting\nresolutions affirming Lebanon\u00eds independence,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We must express\nour gratitude to the United Nations for dispatching the\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, stationed on\nour frontiers with Israel, and for the continuing and\neffective aid we get from the Organization\u00eds\nspecialized agencies.\nToday, we come to this forum with a different\nobjective. Our country is in good shape. It has regained\nits position in the region. We have moved from\ndestruction to construction, from rule by the militias to\nthe rule of law, from anarchy to stability and security,\nand from division to unity. In the 1970s and 1980s,\n\u00ecLebanonization\u00ee became a bad word. It stood for\nanarchy and infighting. Now, however,\n\u00ecLebanonization\u00ee has regained its true, original\nmeaning as a term standing for democracy, freedom,\npluralism and recognition of the other.\nEarly this month, the Security Council adopted its\nresolution 1559 (2004), concerning Lebanon. The\nresolution has two dimensions, one regional, the other\ninternal. As for the regional dimension, the resolution\ncalls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces still in\nLebanon. There are Israeli forces occupying part of\nLebanon: the Sheba\u00eda farms and the surrounding area.\nTogether with the rest of the Assembly, we call for the\nimmediate withdrawal of those forces. From this\nrostrum, we also call upon Israel to halt its daily\nviolations of our airspace.\nThere are also Syrian forces in Lebanon. Those\nforces are on our territory at the request of the\nLebanese Government and in accordance with\nagreements signed by the two parties. Lebanon will\naccept the presence of those troops as long as the\nsecurity situation in the region merits it. It is Lebanon\u00eds\npolicy that not a single non-Lebanese soldier should\nremain on its soil. Our disagreement with the United\nNations concerning the withdrawal of Syrian forces\nlies in the timing of the withdrawal; it is not a\ndisagreement on the principle of withdrawal. The\ntiming is under continuous discussion between the\nLebanese and Syrian Governments; it will depend on\ntheir assessment of the security situation in the region.\nIt is also the policy of Lebanon to support the national\nresistance movement, which played an important role\nin forcing Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.\nAs for the Council's resolution's internal\ndimension - relating to the amendment of our\nConstitution - we consider it an unacceptable\nintervention in our internal affairs. Our Constitution,\nwhich was promulgated in 1926, may be the oldest\n34\n\ndemocratic constitution in the entire Middle East.\nSuccessive Lebanese Parliaments have amended it\nmany times, always in accordance with its own\namendment mechanisms and by absolute majorities.\nLebanon is a civilized democratic country. It\nabides by international law and reveres the moral\nprinciples and values on which it is based. My country\nwas a founding Member of the United Nations in 1945.\nIt played a leading role in the formulation of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. And,\nfrom this rostrum, Lebanon has exposed and opposed\nall destructive and disruptive ideologies and\nmovements that we felt impeded the course of\ncivilization and the future of humanity.\nToday, we stand together with the United Nations\nin opposing international terrorism in all its forms.\nLebanon has witnessed the horrors of terrorism on its\nsoil; it has witnessed innocent people being kidnapped,\ntortured and killed. It knows what terrorism is all\nabout, and, as a result of first-hand knowledge, it\ncondemns it in the strongest terms. We also condemn\nthose who wilfully confuse terrorism with the struggle\nfor national liberation and independence. There are\nthose who exploit the universal revulsion against\nterrorism to smear national liberation movements by\nbranding them as terrorist. National liberation is a right\nand an honour; terrorism is a crime and cowardice.\nLebanon has recovered its stability and freedom.\nWe are not here to ask anything specific for ourselves.\nWe do, however, ask that the United Nations devote\nmore attention to our region. The region is in turmoil,\nand it looks to the United Nations to help establish\npeace. The Organization has been granted legitimacy\nby all nations in its quest to ensure peace and stability.\nWe ask the following of the United Nations. First,\nthe Organization should increase its efforts to solve the\nMiddle East problem. It should do so by implementing\nits resolutions concerning Israel's withdrawal from the\nterritories it occupied in 1967, by giving the\nPalestinians an independent sovereign State and by\nensuring the return of Palestinian refugees to their\nhomeland. The more the Middle East conflict is\nallowed to fester, the more difficult it will be to resolve\nand the more danger and war there will be in the\nregion.\nSecondly, the United Nations should assume\ngreater responsibility in resolving the violent conflict\nin Iraq and in restoring peace, stability and unity to the\nIraqis. The Iraqis have suffered greatly, and they\ndeserve strong and continuing support from the United\nNations so that they can build a free, just and\ndemocratic order.\nThirdly, the Organization should help the Middle\nEast region to achieve a new stable order based on just\nand equitable solutions and on the right to self-\ndetermination, since that region is the birthplace of the\nthree monotheistic religions. The United Nations\nshould also put an end to the arms race and to the\nwaste of capabilities and rid the region of weapons of\nmass destruction.\nFourthly, the United Nations should encourage\nthe establishment of civil organizations as a necessary\nfirst step in the process of reform and democratization.\nIt is difficult to build an accountable democratic\nsystem without diverse and pluralistic civil institutions.\nDemocracy is based on political parties, trade unions,\ncivil institutions, humanitarian organizations and\nassociations of all kinds, which are the foundations of\nreform and democracy.\nLebanon has a clear vision about the future of the\nregion and of its civilization. It wants to play a decisive\nrole in that future, as it did in forging an Eastern\ncivilization in the region, based on the most profound\nprinciples of Christianity and Islam.\nLebanon is an international country, bigger than\nits size and population, due to its emigrants, who\ninhabit every nook and cranny of the world. Wherever\nthey may be, the Lebanese are emissaries of innovation\nand production. Some countries may take pride in\nexporting weapons and in deploying armies, but\nLebanon, since the dawn of history, has prided itself on\nexporting its precious young people, who, in all\ncontinents, assume the highest posts in universities,\nresearch centres, industries and businesses.\nLebanon supports the United Nations because of\nits universal views on humanity and its future. In the\npast, my country may have suffered precisely because\nof its universalism, its openness and its freedom.\nBecause Lebanon has given much, Lebanon deserves\nmuch.\nFinally, I wish the General Assembly and its\nMain Committees every success in addressing the\nmany important items on the agenda. Lebanon will\nparticipate actively in all these proceedings, in any way\nthat will help to attain the objectives of the United\nNations and advance the universal cause of freedom\nand peace."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me first of all to congratulate you\nmost warmly on your election to the important post of\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession and to wish you success in your very complex\ntask. I also wish to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte.\nIn our troubled times, humankind is placing its\nmost cherished hopes on the United Nations. Here at\nthe rostrum of this Organization, I would like to\nexpress our deep satisfaction with the resolve with\nwhich the present session of the Assembly has\nembarked on a policy that is a quest for effective\nsolutions to the key problems now facing the\ninternational community.\nAfter 11 September, the highest priority\nunquestionably has been given to fighting international\nterrorism, which has now acquired the nature of a\ndirect war. This is an evil challenge to humankind. We\nsincerely grieve for the innocent victims of terrorist\nacts, wherever they may occur. Any victim evokes\nsympathy, but the massacre of children in Beslan is\nhideously evil. The time has come for terrorists to be\ncalled to account for their criminal acts.\nThe \u201cterrorist international\u201d must be faced with a\nunited anti-terrorist front on all continents, regions and\ncountries. It is therein that I see the key to victory.\nThe tone was set for this session by the statement\nmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. With his\ncustomary perspicacity, he emphasized that the highest\nvalue is that of the supremacy of law in domestic and\nforeign affairs. Genuine interest in organizing\ncollective action to address new challenges and threats\nwas a leitmotif of the statements made from this\nrostrum by United States President George Bush, the\nheads of several States, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, and other high-\nranking representatives. Those statements were\nevidence of the growing confidence in our\nOrganization and, I believe, represent a long-awaited\nrebuff to those who wish us ill and to sow doubts\nregarding the United Nations ability to resolve today\u2019s\npressing problems.\nA special feature of our forum today is the fact\nthat, along with other extremely important objectives,\nit must serve as a preparatory stage for the sixtieth\n2\n\nanniversary session of the General Assembly. The\ninternational community has the right to expect that\nnext year\u2019s session will prove to be an historic event\nand establish new landmarks for United Nations\nactivity. Recalling the ideals endorsed by the founders\nof the United Nations, and on the basis of\ncontemporary requirements, I would propose that the\nanniversary session be called a summit of peace and\neconomic and social progress.\nTurning now to the United Nations role in the life\nof my country, I should like to convey to the\nOrganization and its specialized agencies our sincere\ngratitude for their support of our national efforts in all\nareas of State-building. My people will forever recall\nthe decision taken at the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly in support of the 2,200th\nanniversary of Kyrgyz statehood.\nOne axiom of Kyrgyz foreign policy is that small\ncountries must have big friends. For us, the United\nNations has always been such a tried and trusted\nfriend. That is most appropriate for the development of\nour Republic on its path to democracy. It is well known\nthat the electoral process is considered to be a litmus\ntest for the level of democracy achieved in any given\ncountry. This year, with direct assistance from\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, the implementation of a\nUnited Nations project in Kyrgyzstan has initiated\nimprovements to the national electoral system with a\nview to ensuring that it meets international standards.\nThat is particularly important given the election\ncampaign now beginning to organs of power at every\nlevel in the Republic. In that context, United States\nPresident George Bush\u2019s proposal that a fund for\ndemocracy be established within the United Nations is\nindeed a good one. Such a fund would substantially\nenhance the United Nations potential in that area.\nI should now like to turn to another problem. Two\nyears ago, under United Nations auspices, the Global\nMountain Summit was convened in our capital,\nBishkek. In that context, too, we are most grateful for\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s assistance. The Bishkek Global\nMountain Platform was drafted at the Summit, defining\nkey objectives for the sustainable development of\nmountain countries. That important document was\nsubmitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession.\nAt this session, I wish also to draw the\ninternational community\u2019s attention to the needs of the\nleast developed mountain countries. The time has come\nto propose, on behalf of interested countries, the\nadoption at this session of a special resolution\nrecommending forgiveness of the foreign debt of the\nleast developed mountain countries. That would serve\nas a powerful stimulus to their comprehensive\ndevelopment and to overcoming poverty and would\nfully jibe with the objectives proclaimed in the\nMillennium Declaration. A draft resolution on that\nsubject will be submitted to the General Assembly by\nthe delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic and other\ndelegations.\nIn considering future prospects, I believe that the\ninterests of all groups of countries are most fully\nreflected in the decisions of the Millennium Summit. I\nam gratified that a thorough and scrupulous analysis of\nthe results of five years of implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration is being planned as a major\nelement on the agenda of the sixtieth anniversary\nsession of the General Assembly. I consider the war on\npoverty to be of great importance in that context. The\nlink between poverty and international terrorism is\nindisputable. Those phenomena are organically\nintertwined. Unless we can overcome poverty and the\nmass despair and sense of hopelessness it entails, in\nparticular among young people, our hopes for\nuprooting international terrorism may indeed prove\nfutile.\nIn seeking to eradicate poverty, Kyrgyzstan is\nrelying above all on its own potential. We are most\ngrateful in that respect for the assistance of the United\nNations and the international community, expressed,\ninter alia, in the Monterrey Consensus. In that\nconnection, we are hoping for increased assistance\nthrough the United States Millennium Challenge\nAccount. In general, assistance for the development of\npoor countries could be considerably enhanced. I\nbelieve that this problem will also be duly reflected in\nthe work of the present and anniversary sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nEarlier, I linked the eradication of poverty and the\nfight against international terrorism. Within the range\nof interlinked measures, however, a policy to eradicate\ninternational terrorism through the vigorous application\nof collective force is of unique significance. Within the\nframework of the anti-terrorist Coalition now active\nunder United States auspices, Kyrgyzstan is making an\nimportant contribution to suppressing the ever-active\nhotbed of terrorism in Afghanistan. I am convinced\n3\n\nthat the October elections in that country will be a very\nimportant factor in its democratic reorganization and\nhave a positive impact on the situation in the region as\na whole.\nIn order to enhance its contribution to the\ninternational community\u2019s war on international\nterrorism, Kyrgyzstan has allowed the deployment on\nits territory \u2014 within limited parameters, I would\nemphasize \u2014 of armed Russian and United States\ncontingents. We are convinced that, in so doing, we are\nstrengthening the interaction of those great Powers in\ntoday\u2019s war on a common enemy. Our Kyrgyz land will\ncontinue to be a place for the great Powers to cooperate\nand to pool their efforts, rather than to compete.\nWe support international action to eradicate the\nterrorist threat in Iraq. That has become the principal\nobstacle to the development of democracy and to\nensuring peace in that country. We know from our own\nexperience that this is a long and thorny path, but one\nthat Iraq will have to take. The foundation for the\ninternational community\u2019s actions must be the\nprinciple that, in assisting Afghanistan and Iraq in\ncombating terrorism, establishing peace and building\ndemocracy, we are assisting ourselves.\nI believe that there is a need here to unmask any\nattempt to provide scholarly justification of any sort\nfor international terrorism. I am referring here in\nparticular to the concept of the clash of civilizations,\nwhich cannot be thought of as an innocent theoretical\nexercise.\nIn that light, this summer, along the shores of our\n\u201cblue pearl\u201d, Lake Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan and the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization organized a conference entitled \u201cEurasia\nin the twenty-first century: Dialogue of cultures or a\nconflict of civilizations?\u201d The idea of a conflict of\ncivilizations was firmly condemned at the conference.\nFor my part, I believe that the term \u201cconflict of\ncivilizations\u201d should be erased from the global political\nlexicon as unfounded theoretically and harmful in\npractice. I note with satisfaction that, in his statement\nat this session, President Bush rejected the concept of a\nconflict of civilizations. The future belongs to the\ndialogue of cultures and civilizations.\nIn conclusion, I wish to address the issue of\nUnited Nations reform. Kyrgyzstan supports proposals\naimed at bringing the Organization ever more closely\nin line with the realities of the twenty-first century,\nparticularly with respect to the role of the Security\nCouncil. In that regard, I believe that the United\nNations at its anniversary session can and must decide\nto include Germany and Japan among the permanent\nmembers of the Council. We also support the\nexpansion of the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories of Council membership on the basis of the\nprinciple of equal geographic distribution.\nThe enhancement of the United Nations\npeacekeeping potential is another positive concept.\nKyrgyzstan will continue to respond positively to\nrequests for its personnel in efforts to attain those\ngoals.\nLastly, Kyrgyzstan and other countries of Central\nAsia, in cooperation with Russia and China, intend to\ncontinue to support the international community\u2019s\nefforts to counter international terrorism and to meet\nother global challenges and threats through active\nregional measures. Evidence of our resolve is the\ngrowing role of the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates and the Collective Security Organization.\nFrom this high rostrum, I reaffirm that\nKyrgyzstan, in a spirit of unwavering dedication to the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations, will\ncontinue to be a reliable link in the international\ncommunity\u2019s efforts to ensure peace, security and\nprosperity for all peoples of this planet."

        "file_text": "I would like to join\nothers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\nelection to direct the affairs of the General\nAssembly \u2014 this great parliament of nations \u2014 at its\nfifty-ninth session. Let me also take this opportunity to\npay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Julian Hunte, especially for the momentum he gave\nto the ongoing process of the revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nOnce again, in his annual report on the work of\nthe Organization and in his forthright statement to the\nAssembly last week, the Secretary-General set the tone\nof the annual general debate. My delegation commends\nhim for his tenacity and courage under extreme\npolitical circumstances and shares his overall\nassessment of the current international situation and\nthe role of the United Nations.\n20\n\nJust a little more than three weeks ago, on the\ninitiative of the member States of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, the Assembly reaffirmed the central role of\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security and the promotion of international\ncooperation. It was, indeed, a reaffirmation that this\nOrganization was founded on international cooperation\nand that its efficacy is rooted in international\ncooperation. My delegation therefore urges all Member\nStates to adhere to the principle of cooperation.\nSierra Leone believes, and will continue to\nbelieve in the United Nations. After all, we are part of\nthe United Nations, like each and every State\nrepresented in the General Assembly. Of course there\nare some difficulties, but we strongly believe that,\ngiven adequate resources and cooperative support in a\ntimely manner and given the necessary moral and\npolitical support, the United Nations can deliver, as it\nhas done admirably in Sierra Leone.\nIn that connection, allow me to express our\nsincere appreciation to all the countries that have\ncontributed to the United Nations Mission in Sierra\nLeone (UNAMSIL). Our thanks also go out to the staff\nof all the agencies and programmes of the United\nNations family and the non-governmental\norganizations that have worked in partnership with the\nUnited Nations, the Government and civil society to\nrestore peace and stability in our country and, most\nrecently, to conduct local government elections.\nA theme that has reverberated within the Hall in\nthe past week, and in other international forums, is the\nobservance of the rule of law. The Secretary-General\u2019s\nanalysis of its significance needs no embellishment.\nThe causes and character of the conflict in Sierra\nLeone, perhaps more than in any other country in the\nworld in recent times, tell us that nearly everything\ncrumbles when the rule of law collapses and that,\ntherefore, it should be made the pillar of post-conflict\nreconstruction, national recovery, governance and\nadministration of justice and the cornerstone of lasting\npeace.\nWhile the Government of Sierra Leone is\nstruggling, albeit with limited resources, to reform its\nown administration of justice, it is also concerned\nabout the financial situation of the Special Court,\nestablished in the country to address impunity. The\nefficacy, and indeed the credibility of the Court, could\nbe questioned unless urgent measures are taken to\naddress its budgetary problems. I should therefore like\nto take this opportunity to appeal for continued\nvoluntary contributions, as well as the requested\nsubventions from the regular budget of the United\nNations for the Special Court.\nAs President Kabbah said at the formal opening\nof the courthouse last March, it is\n\u201ca Special Court for Sierra Leone, a symbol of\nthe rule of law and an essential element in the\npursuit of peace, justice and national\nreconciliation for the people of Sierra Leone. It is\nalso a Special Court for the international\ncommunity, a symbol of the rule of international\nlaw.\u201d\nThere is no guarantee that the victims of\nviolations of international humanitarian and human\nrights law during the civil war in Sierra Leone will\nreceive reparation for those heinous crimes. So the\nleast we can do for them now is to ensure that justice is\ndone. We can do so by reducing the financial burden of\nthe Special Court and by demonstrating that we are\nindeed serious about respect for the rule of law.\nThe United Nations was formed over 50 years\nago as a response to the peace and security needs of the\nera of its birth. Since then, the world has experienced,\nand continues to experience, fundamental changes, to\nwhich the United Nations should adapt. That is why\nSierra Leoneans continue to follow with profound\ninterest the consultative processes for the revitalization\nof the General Assembly and reforms in the Security\nCouncil in order to reflect the reality of the\ncontemporary world. My delegation wishes to urge the\nPresident to sustain the momentum in the processes\ngenerated by the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe menace of terrorism and local conflicts\ncontinues to impede peace, stability and development\nin many parts of the world. Innocent victims aside,\nconflicts have reversed the development gains of poor\ncountries, and even reduced them to the status of\ndonor-dependants. While deploring all acts of\nterrorism, it is important to recognize that poor\ncountries, particularly those emerging from conflict,\nhave weak capacity to fight terrorism. If global action\nis what is needed to fight terrorism, and my delegation\nbelieves that this should be the case, efforts should be\nmade to enhance the capacity of poor countries to play\ntheir own role in that battle.\n21\n\nAfter about 11 years of a violent and destructive\ncivil conflict, Sierra Leone is now in the delicate post-\nconflict phase. It is in that phase that the root causes of\nthe conflict should be addressed and the foundation for\npermanent peace, stability and sustainable development\nshould be laid. In short, that is the phase in which the\ngains of the peace effort should be maximized, using a\nsynergetic approach that incorporates development and\nother strands of generators of peace into peacekeeping.\nBut this approach needs resources and planning beyond\nthe traditional peacekeeping strategies that involve\npulling out when the guns fall silent.\nIt is in that regard that my delegation is soliciting\ncontinued and enhanced support for post-conflict\nSierra Leone. An important component of this appeal is\nthat development and financial institutions should\nunderstand the multifaceted demands and delicate\ncharacter of post-conflict situations and treat them as\nspecial cases. That means that those institutions should\nrevisit their rigid and standard prescriptions, with the\npurpose of making them flexible and responsive to the\nspecial requirements of post-conflict situations.\nTen days ago, the Security Council extended the\nmandate of UNAMSIL to June 2005. The Government\nof Sierra Leone has endorsed the Secretary-General\u2019s\nassessment and recommendations regarding the\nbenchmarks for the residual presence of UNAMSIL in\nthe country. We note in particular that, over the next\nseveral months, the Security Council will review the\nresidual functions against the capacity of the Sierra\nLeone armed forces and police to maintain security and\nstability effectively throughout the country. We hope\nthat the review will also take into consideration the\nsecurity situation in the subregion.\nI would like to reassure the international\ncommunity through the Assembly that we do not\nexpect UNAMSIL to remain in Sierra Leone\nindefinitely. The Government of Sierra Leone is\ndetermined to ensure a smooth and seamless transition\nfrom UNAMSIL to the Republic of Sierra Leone\nArmed Forces and the police throughout the country.\nThe restructured army and the police have already\ndemonstrated through training, discipline and\nperformance that they are nearly ready to assume full\nresponsibility for the security and safety of the people\nof Sierra Leone. But training is only a part of the total\npicture of readiness. For effective operational\nreadiness, both the army and the police need logistical\nsupport and equipment. Accordingly, my delegation\nwishes to appeal to friendly nations for assistance to\nequip our security forces to enable them to function\neffectively. Meanwhile, for obvious reasons, the\nGovernment and people of Sierra Leone are\nencouraged by the prospects for consolidating the\ndeployment of the United Nations peacekeeping\nmission throughout neighbouring Liberia.\nRecent dialogue between, and among, the leaders\nof the Mano River Union also augur well for peace and\nstability in our subregion. We need the continued\nsupport of the international community in resuscitating\nthe objectives and programmes of the Mano River\nUnion, because, if fully functional, it can complement\nthe efforts of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations in\nthe subregion. In that connection, I would like to\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for\nhis encouragement of the rejuvenation process of the\nUnion.\nThe United Nations has already identified many\nof the root causes of armed conflict within States. With\nthe assistance of the international community, efforts\nare being made to address those root causes. The\nobjective is to prevent the recurrence of armed\nconflicts. My delegation believes that equal attention\nshould also be paid to the root causes of armed conflict\nacross States, including the senseless acts of\ninternational terrorism that are being perpetrated in\nmany parts of the world. While prompt, effective and\ndecisive measures are absolutely necessary to deal with\nthe phenomenon, it is about time that we try to identify\nand address the root causes of such ignoble acts.\nNew challenges are emerging and new threats are\nbeing hatched in various corners of our world with\nunprecedented frequency. However, we must not forget\nthe old, unresolved challenges and threats to human\nsafety and security. Without prejudging the outcome of\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, Sierra Leone hopes that the\nPanel\u2019s report will help to throw some light on the\nprobable link between what could be described as old\nand still existing threats and those now being\ncharacterized as new threats and challenges. Perhaps,\nas President Kabbah suggested at the Millennium\nSummit four years ago, the old and still existing\nchallenges are taking on a new form and new\ndimensions. What we are experiencing is, perhaps, the\ntransmutation of threats and challenges.\n22\n\nIn speaking of old challenges and threats, the\nquestion of Palestine comes to mind. It has been on our\nagenda for far too long. We know that that is a complex\nissue. However, the longer it remains unresolved, the\ngreater the risk of unending cycles of violence. Sierra\nLeone firmly believes that an equitable solution, in\nparticular the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State side by side with Israel within secure\nborders, would be a giant step towards peace and\nsecurity, not only in the Middle East but also in the rest\nof our troubled and unsafe world.\nStill in the area of existing threats to international\npeace and security, my delegation is disturbed by the\ntragic humanitarian situation in the Darfur region of\nthe Sudan. We applaud the response of the African\nUnion to the crisis and urge all stakeholders to do\nwhatever is necessary to speedily resolve the conflict.\nBut let me emphasize that the African Union would\nlike to do more \u2014 and would do more if it had the\nresources. Accordingly, I would like to make an open\nappeal, on behalf of the African Union Commission,\nfor financial and material support for the African\nUnion to enable it to deal with the situation.\nThe Government and the people of Sierra Leone\nknow from experience that ceasefire, disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration are essential\ncomponents of peace. But we are still faced with the\ndaunting task of consolidating the peace, because peace\ngoes far beyond the process of the disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. The\nconsolidation of peace \u2014 real peace \u2014 means\nimprovements in the lives and livelihoods of all our\npeople. It means jobs, food, education, health care,\nadequate housing and other social services. As the\nSecretary-General observed in his most recent report\non the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone,\nconsiderable progress has been made towards\neconomic and social recovery. However, in order to\nsustain the process of consolidating peace and to\nfacilitate the smooth transition from recovery to\nsustainable development, Sierra Leone needs continued\nsupport, particularly for vulnerable areas of the\ncountry.\nWe look forward to the 2005 comprehensive\nreview of the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals \u2014 a review that will coincide with\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. We in\nSierra Leone will also be reviewing the state of our\nfood security goal of ensuring that by the end of 2007,\nno Sierra Leonean will go to bed hungry. Our food\nsecurity goal must be seen in the context of one of the\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals,\nnamely, the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger.\nGiven the grave consequences of extreme poverty and\nstarvation, those are realistic goals. They represent the\nminimum standard necessary to save lives. They are\nattainable.\nWe know that it is our responsibility to do more\nfor ourselves. We also know the urgency of addressing\nthe democratic deficit in international economic and\nfinancial decision-making. In our interdependent and\nincreasingly globalizing world, economic and social\ninequities within countries are a reflection of unfair\nrules, unfair trade practices and an uneven playing\nfield in international transactions. The Director-\nGeneral of the International Labour Organization, Juan\nSomavia, was correct when he told the recent African\nUnion summit in Ouagadougou that good national\ngovernance will not succeed unless we have good\nglobal governance.\nConsumers need to share, in a more equitable\nmanner with producers in the developing world, the\nbenefits derived from their abundant natural and\nhuman resources. That means, among other things, fair\nprices and debt relief, all of which should have a\npositive impact on our capacity to reduce poverty\nwithin our respective developing countries."

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that I\nbring warm greetings from the Government and people\nof Kiribati on whose behalf I have the honour to\naddress the Assembly today.\nBefore I begin, I would like to extend our\ncongratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his election to the\npresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. We have every confidence in his able\nleadership to guide the work of the Assembly and to\ndeliver conclusive outcomes. He has our full support\nand cooperation in carrying out his work. I wish also to\nthank the President\u2019s predecessor for the excellent\nwork he has done in steering the work of the Assembly\nduring the past year. My congratulations also go to the\nSecretary-General for his sterling leadership of our\nOrganization during these trying times and for rising\ncommendably to the challenge.\nWe gather again this year amidst the reality of\ndaunting challenges that continue to confront us as\nindividual nations and as a global community. The\nongoing conflicts in Iraq and other parts of the world,\nthe scourge of terrorism and the existence of nuclear\narsenals, accelerated environmental degradation and\nthe threat of global warming and sea-level rise, hunger\nand poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other non-\ncommunicable diseases, the marginalization of the\nleast developed countries within the global economy\nand underdevelopment, all continue to pose major\nchallenges that our Organization must address today.\nThose challenges cast a dark shadow over the\ncommitments made by world leaders at the Millennium\nSummit held here in New York four years ago,\npledging to work collectively to maintain peace and\nsecurity, to eliminate poverty and to promote\ndevelopment for the benefit of all mankind in the new\nmillennium.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nand the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\ncontinue to threaten international security. We must be\nunified in our approach and address those challenges\neffectively by strengthening multilateral disarmament\nand non-proliferation treaties and agreements and\nthrough closer regional and international cooperation.\nKiribati supports all non-proliferation efforts and in\nthat respect is party to, among others, the Treaty on the\n2\n\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the\nChemical Weapons Convention.\nWe commend and support the work of the\ninternational community and efforts taken at the\nnational, regional and international levels to respond to\nthe challenges of terrorism, recognizing the need for\ninternational solidarity in addressing that increasing\nglobal threat.\nKiribati is committed to the global fight against\nterrorism. Terrorism knows no boundaries and we\ncannot claim immunity from it. Indeed, as a small\nisland developing State we have very little capacity to\ndevelop any effective countermeasures and are\ntherefore especially vulnerable to terrorism.\nWe acknowledge the importance of complying\nwith United Nations resolutions and international\nsecurity arrangements that have been adopted in the\nfight against terrorism. While we cannot afford to be\ncomplacent in our efforts in that regard, it must be\nrecognized that the requirements for compliance with\nthose resolutions and arrangements do pose enormous\nchallenges for countries such as Kiribati. Our limited\nresources and technical capacity are already committed\nto providing for the basic and essential social and\neconomic needs of our rapidly growing population,\nthus placing severe constraints on our ability to make\nprogress in compliance. I would like to note, however,\nthat, with technical assistance from our development\npartners, we have made progress in enacting important\nlegislation relating to terrorism and transnational\ncrime. We expect to make further progress on\ncompliance with the counter-terrorism requirements\nshortly.\nThe progress made so far has revolved primarily\naround the introduction of legislation. We recognize\nthat this is just the beginning of the process. The\nimplementation and enforcement of the legislation\nenacted will pose an immense challenge. In this\nrespect, we will continue to count on the assistance and\nsupport of the international community.\nWe note with deep regret and concern the loss of\nlife and devastation to property caused by the recent\nseries of hurricanes affecting the Caribbean and the\nAtlantic coast of the United States. We offer our deep\nsympathy to those affected by those natural disasters.\nThe adverse impact of climate change and sea-\nlevel rise is, indeed, a critical security issue for the\nglobal community in this new millennium, especially\nfor low-lying island States like Kiribati. That issue\nmust take centre stage with other international security\nissues. We urge the international community to agree\non a unified global response in order to better protect\nthe environment, in the same way that the international\ncommunity is being encouraged to respond to terrorism\nand other threats to global security. Our inability as a\nglobal community to agree on a unified stand on\nclimate change and sea-level rise is very disappointing\nindeed, and we deplore the notion that economic\ngrowth must take precedence over environmental\nissues at any cost. Our very existence as a State \u2014\nindeed, the existence all States similar to Kiribati \u2014 is\nat stake if such thinking continues to prevail.\nI would like at this juncture to express our\ngratitude to the many countries that have ratified the\nKyoto Protocol and to appeal to those that have not to\ndo so as a matter of urgency. We have demonstrated\nremarkable solidarity in the fight against global\nterrorism. Can we not demonstrate the same solidarity\nin the fight against climate change and sea-level rise?\nRegional cooperation has been a very effective\nmechanism in addressing the many challenges faced by\ncountries in our region. Regional cooperation has\nenabled many Pacific countries to meet some of the\ncounter-terrorism requirements. Regional cooperation\nhas also enabled us to effectively address emerging\nissues confronting our region; the outstanding success\nof the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands\nis a clear demonstration of that.\nWe in the Pacific are confident of our ability to\nsteer a course for the future. We have approved work to\ncommence on a Pacific plan that will promote\ncollective action in the areas of security, good\ngovernance, economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment. We envisage that the Pacific plan will\nresult in the delivery of tangible benefits to our\nrespective peoples and communities.\nWe recognize the need for, and welcome,\nstrengthened cooperation and the development of\ncloser linkages and partnerships between the United\nNations and its specialized agencies and other\norganizations, including the Pacific Islands Forum.\nSuch linkages and partnerships can only result in the\nmore effective, coordinated and harmonized delivery of\nassistance to member countries.\nMaking progress with regard to the development\naspirations of our peoples is a high \u2014 if not the\nhighest \u2014 priority for many of us who are here today.\nOur national policy objective is to achieve the\n3\n\nequitable distribution of development benefits to all\nour peoples, based on the principles of good\ngovernance. We are committed to the Millennium\nDeclaration and are on track in our national efforts to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nThe Goals have been integrated and\nmainstreamed into our national development strategy.\nWe are committed to pursuing those goals as the basis\nof sustainable development. In this connection, I would\nlike to express our appreciation to all our development\npartners, who, over the years, have contributed\nmeaningfully to the realization of our development\naspirations.\nWhile we are grateful for the assistance extended\nby our development partners, there is scope for us to\nachieve more for our peoples \u2014 and to do so without\ndevelopment assistance. Kiribati has a large exclusive\neconomic zone that has an abundant fisheries resource.\nThose resources are presently being harvested by\nvessels from distant-water fishing nations under license\narrangements. However, the return from these licensing\narrangements is negligible, at only around 5 per cent of\nthe landed value of the catch.\nNaturally, we would like to see greater returns\nfrom that resource. Our ability to achieve sustainable\neconomic development depends on it. Accordingly, we\nurge the flag States of those fishing interests to\nencourage their industries to explore the mutual\nbenefits to be gained from collaboration with resource\nowners in establishing on-shore facilities that will add\nvalue to the commodity. We believe that such a model\nwill also result in easing the pressure on fish stocks\nand ensure conservation of the resource for the\nsustainable benefit of mankind.\nThe entry into force in June this year of the\nWestern and Central Pacific Tuna Convention\nrepresents a major development in the management of\nthe western and central Pacific tuna fishery.\nIn this age of rapid globalization, advances in\ninformation technology and trade liberalization, it is\nregrettable that, while some are reaping the full\nbenefits of those advances and developments,\nsignificantly more remain on the fringes. The reality is\nthat a large proportion of the world\u2019s population, most\nof whom live in developing countries, continue to live\nin poverty and are marginalized in trading\narrangements and market access opportunities. The\npromise of globalization and open trading as a positive\nforce for economic growth, and social progress\ncontinues to elude the many. Much work needs to be\ndone to ensure that the many also enjoy the benefits of\nglobalization.\nKiribati supports the findings of the report of the\nWorld Commission on the Social Dimension of\nGlobalization. We urge that the findings of the report\nbe taken into consideration and incorporated into the\nwork of the Assembly, especially for the 2005 high-\nlevel review of the outcome of the Millennium\nSummit.\nWe welcome the United Nations support for the\nconvening, early next year in Mauritius, of the\nInternational Meeting for the 10-Year Review of the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Like\nother small island developing States, we attach great\nimportance to that review. With the continued support\nand commitment of our development partners to the\nprocess, we can be assured of important outcomes that\nwill go a long way in making a real difference to the\nquality of life for our peoples.\nWe share the concerns of the international\ncommunity about the spread of HIV/AIDS and its\ndevastating impact as both a health crisis and a\ndevelopment concern. We welcome the recent\ndevelopments in the search for affordable drugs for\nHIV/AIDS victims in developing countries. We\nencourage greater collaboration on HIV/AIDS research\nand the mobilization of resources for prevention\nactivities and for better medical care for affected\npatients.\nWe believe in the continuing relevance and\nimportance of the role of the United Nations and its\nability to respond to the challenges of our\ncontemporary world. In this regard, Kiribati welcomes\nand fully supports the efforts to reform this\nOrganization to enable it to better respond to the\nchallenges of this era.\nGiven the crucial role of the Security Council in\nthe promotion of international peace and security and\nthe importance we attach to that issue, we see the\nnecessity for Security Council reform, including the\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent\nmembership of the Council. Expansion is required to\nbetter reflect the realities of our world today. We note\nthat some countries, including Japan, have consistently\ncommitted substantial resources towards the\nmaintenance of global peace and security, and we\nbelieve that they should be accorded permanent\nmembership on the Security Council.\n4\n\nWe attach great importance to our membership in\nthis noble Organization, and we reaffirm our\ncommitment to upholding the noble values and\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. The Charter epitomizes our hope for\nachieving justice and equality and the safeguarding and\npromotion of fundamental human rights of all peoples.\nWithin that context, we believe that the exclusionary\nprinciples applied to Taiwan in its bid for United\nNations membership go against the very values and\nobjectives of the Charter that we all strive to uphold. In\nthis era of tension and conflict we should discard the\npresent exclusionary practices and adopt a more\nembracing environment where all countries willing and\nable to contribute to the international community\u2019s\nefforts to promote world peace and stability are\nwelcomed as equal partners. Taiwan has made and\ncontinues to make notable contributions to the\ndevelopment of many developing countries and has the\ncapacity to contribute constructively to the good work\nof the United Nations. It is therefore regrettable that\nthe desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to again\nbecome a part of that global community of nations\ncontinues to be rejected.\nThe challenges that confront us at this point in\ntime are indeed daunting, but they are not\ninsurmountable. With renewed commitments and with\na common resolve to work in close cooperation and in\nsupport of each other, we can succeed in creating a\nmore secure, a more prosperous and a more just world\nfor all in this millennium."

        "file_text": "I am\noverwhelmed with a great sense of joy at seeing\nMr. Ping preside over the General Assembly at this\nfifty-ninth session. My first words are thus to convey\nto him, on behalf of my Government and on my own\nbehalf, the most heartfelt congratulations upon his\nelection. Our satisfaction springs from the great esteem\nin which the Angolan people hold your country and\nfrom the strong ties of friendship and fraternity that\nunite us.\nI would also like to congratulate your predecessor\nfor the dynamic manner in which he carried out his\nmandate.\n53\n\nAt a time when the world is confronting the\nhorrors of violence, poverty and hunger, the members\nof the Assembly once again have the difficult\nresponsibility of assessing the implementation of their\ndecisions and of seeking new solutions to problems\nthat affect millions of human beings \u2014 solutions that\nwill require a mechanism for international cooperation.\nThe United Nations must remain the pivotal\ninstrument for States in dealing with new international\nchallenges to peace and security, such as terrorism;\nhunger; poverty; violations of human rights that\ncontinue to deprive millions of human beings of their\nfundamental freedoms; the degradation of the\nenvironment; organized transnational crime, including\ndrug trafficking; and HIV/AIDS.\nThe recent difficulties that the United Nations has\nconfronted in dealing with situations that have\nseriously affected international security have exposed\nthe limitations of its structure and its operation. The\nUnited Nations system must be urgently reformed and\nadapted to the demands and challenges of the current\nsituation, which is characterized by globalization.\nThe main organs of the United Nations lack the\nbroad democratic character that they need in order to\nexpress the will of the majority of the Members of the\nOrganization. Both categories of membership of the\nSecurity Council should be expanded \u2014 on the basis of\nequitable geographical representation \u2014 so as to\nreflect the new international order.\nIn the past 50 years, humanity has made\nimportant advances in the areas of science and\ntechnology, economic development, medicine and\nother fields, which have resulted in improved living\nconditions and in an increase in the life expectancy of\nvast segments of the world\u2019s population, as well as in\nthe growth of the world\u2019s material and even spiritual\nwealth.\nHowever, while some countries and continents\nhave shared in those gains, others continue to be\nmarginalized \u2014 overwhelmed by economic setbacks\nthat force a significant part of their population to live\nbelow the poverty line.\nThe aspirations of such people to a world of\nsocial justice and the full exercise of their economic\nand social rights, including the right to development,\ncontinue to be unfulfilled. In fact, the ranks of the poor\nhave not stopped growing: since 1990, the number of\npoor people has been growing in sub-Saharan Africa,\nSouthern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIn the recent summit on hunger and poverty,\npromoted by the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva,\nworld leaders highlighted the dramatic situation of\nbillions of human beings living mainly in developing\ncountries who are suffering from hunger, malnutrition\nand diseases that are easily preventable.\nThis is a reprehensible picture, and we must\ntherefore make the eradication of hunger and poverty a\npriority in our national policies and on the\nOrganization\u2019s agenda. This dramatic situation could\nrapidly be reversed by a greater commitment on the\npart of the Governments of developing countries and a\nstronger political will on the part of the richest\ncountries.\nFurthermore, restrictions on international free\ntrade have contributed to a deterioration in the living\nconditions of people in countries subjected to\nrestrictive economic measures, as is the case in Cuba.\nWe believe that such measures constitute an assault on\nmoral and humanitarian principles.\nIn spite of the efforts made by developing nations\nto improve their economic performance and the\nwell-being of their populations, the practical results do\nnot measure up to the needs of the development\nprocess. This is partly the result of the imposition on\ndeveloping countries of policies that do not take their\nrealities into account.\nSome institutions and rich countries are\npressuring poor countries to follow the steps taken by\nindustrialized countries during their economic\ndevelopment, alleging that developing countries will\ndevelop faster because of the benefits resulting from\nthe implementation of policies that have in the past\nyielded positive results.\nSuch guidelines do not come close to meeting the\ndevelopment needs of poor countries. They fail to\nplace an emphasis on training institutions at the local\nand national level; those institutions should, indeed,\nserve as levers for development.\nWealthy nations have a moral responsibility to\nfoster a spirit of partnership, not of inequality and\ndependence, so as to contribute to the development of\nthe less affluent countries and to the establishment of\ninstitutions capable of sustaining their integration into\nthe global economy.\n54\n\nThe existing economic disparities between the\nwealthy countries of the North and the developing\ncountries of the South is not the result of choice on the\npart of the latter. The enrichment of the industrialized\nworld has been achieved at the expense of the\nimpoverishment of the Third World through the\nrampant exploitation of its natural resources and\nworkforce and the imposition of a system of\noccupation and dominance.\nToday, our countries and peoples are still\nsuffering as a result of those policies of exploitation\nand subjugation, which in some cases have been\nworsened by internal conflicts that came about after the\nend of the period of foreign dominance.\nIt appears to us at times that the international\nfinancial institutions and the rich countries deliberately\nminimize those facts. From our point of view, the\nextensive hesitation with respect to financial assistance\nto developing countries is unjustified. Furthermore,\nsome of the imposed preconditions seem to be a\nresponse more to political interests rather than to the\nrequirements of sustainable economic development.\nWe had until recently called on this body and on\nthe international community to support the restoration\nof peace in Angola. That long-sought peace has finally\narrived and it has proved to be irreversible.\nThe success of the peace process ushered in a\nnew phase: the laying of the political groundwork for\nthe construction of a new society, one based on the rule\nof law, tolerance, a market economy, and the existence\nof a vibrant civil society. In addition to that political\nprocess, my Government is engaged in economic\nreform, which is a contributing factor to economic and\nsocial stability. Were it not for the tremendous,\nsimultaneous challenges that we have had to face, that\nprocess could have been faster.\nSo far, the Angolan Government has been\ntackling alone the task of national reconstruction. That\ntask involves the rehabilitation of social and productive\ninfrastructures, which were almost totally destroyed by\nthe armed conflict; the social reintegration of nearly\n100,000 former combatants and their families; the\nresettlement of more than 4 million internally displaced\npersons and more than 400,000 refugees; and a far-\nreaching effort to reduce the poverty that afflicts most\nof the population. This very difficult task can be\nsuccessful only with the full participation of the\ninternational community.\nThe reservations expressed by certain\ninternational donors in terms of providing assistance to\nAngola \u2014 overlooking the fact that the internal\nconflict was quite lengthy and destructive, that it\nabsorbed a large part of the country\u2019s financial, human\nand materials resources, and that it disrupted the\ncountry \u2014 can be justified only by a lack of political\nwill.\nThe reconstruction of Angola urgently requires\npartnerships and substantial support comparable to the\nassistance given to other countries in post-conflict\nsituations.\nAs a country that is rejoicing in the peace and\nfreedom for which it fought for 40 years, Angola is\nconcerned with the instability in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, a country that shares an\nextensive land border with Angola, and with which we\nhave fraternal ties. We were particularly shocked by\nthe massacres of civilians in Gatumba. The\nperpetrators of that heinous act, who provoked a new\nescalation of violence in order to make the peace\nprocess unworkable, must be held judicially\naccountable. That act makes clear, inter alia, that,\ndespite the significant efforts made in the context of\nthe peace process in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, the situation is still quite fragile.\nThe international community, particularly the\nSecurity Council and the African Union, must devote\nspecial and ongoing attention to this issue in order to\navoid a collapse of the process.\nIn that context, subregional organizations, the\ncountries of the region and other bodies involved in the\npursuit of lasting peace in that country must cooperate,\nwith a view to encouraging the Congolese parties to\nmeet their commitments under the transitional process.\nIt is crucial that all the countries neighbouring the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo reiterate their\ncommitment to continue to respect the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the country and not to interfere\nin its internal affairs.\nThe Transitional Government of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo needs the support of the\ninternational community. My Government is willing, to\nthe extent of its ability, to supply the necessary\nassistance in the process of the consolidation of peace\nand stability in that country.\n55\n\nThe crisis in Darfur is a thorn in the international\njuridical conscience. Angola supports the decision of\nthe Secretary-General to authorize an investigation. We\nhope that the authorities of the Sudan will fully\ncooperate with the African Union and the Security\nCouncil in their efforts to help bring peace to the\npeople of that region. We believe that there now exists\na solid basis for resolving that conflict.\nHaving in the past been a victim of terrorism,\nAngola cannot be indifferent to acts of terrorism,\nwherever they may happen. The acts of terrorism we\nhave witnessed in recent times, and the vile and cruel\nform they have taken, should not discourage the efforts\nthat the international community has been making to\nroot out their perpetrators, but should instead increase\nits determination to isolate terrorist groups and stymie\ntheir efforts.\nWe believe, however, that we should reflect\nfurther on ways to prevent and combat terrorism. Have\nthe methods used to date been effective in eradicating\nterrorism? Is the current system of collective security\ncapable of coping with the aggressiveness of the\nterrorists? Would responses to terrorism based on the\nmultilateral efforts of the United Nations be less\neffective?"

        "file_text": "This year\u2019s general debate\nunfolds against an international backdrop in which\nterrorist acts of great ferocity have become all too\ncommon. The latest, heinous form of terrorism is\nhostage-taking, which has caused deep sorrow to many\nof our nations. Again and again, the international\ncommunity has been caught off guard, unable to\nrespond quickly or effectively. New humanitarian\ncatastrophes have afflicted some of the world\u2019s poorest\npeoples. Difficult stabilization processes are still under\nway in many regions where the international community\nis implementing United Nations resolutions.\nSome areas of the world have seen economic and\nsocial progress. Yet we cannot ignore the fact that\nentire regions \u2014 especially in Africa \u2014 are crippled\nby poverty, malnutrition, disease and illiteracy. That is\nwhy Italy takes a leading role in combating those ills in\nmultilateral forums and through bilateral means.\nOur peoples demand security. We must join\nforces to strengthen international cooperation and to\nconfront the common threat of terrorist organizations.\nThe false prophets of terror are able to spread their\nmessage of death as a result of ignorance among\ncultures. To counter their distortions, we should\nmobilize people\u2019s consciences and strengthen dialogue\namong civilizations with different histories but shared\nvalues and a common belief in human dignity.\nPeace and development \u2014 the agenda of security\nand human promotion \u2014 are related goals that require\na coordinated approach carried out through multilateral\ninstitutions and in a spirit of equal partnership with\ndeveloping countries. In that regard, I would like to\nstress the fundamental importance of a major event that\nwill take place in 2005. That initiative will be a unique\nopportunity for a comprehensive review of progress\ntowards the attainment of the Millennium Development\nGoals.\nIn our globalized, interdependent world,\ninternational organizations are expected to provide\nleadership not only through abstract formulations of\ngeneral principles, but also through effective, shared\ninitiatives supported by broad consensus. Our priority\nis to strengthen the multilateral system and to\nreinvigorate the role of the United Nations. That is the\nresponsibility that the Secretary-General set out for us\n27\n\nat the last session of the General Assembly. There are\ntwo conditions for success: a sounder understanding of\nthe threats we face and a broad consensus on the\npolicies aimed at confronting them. Effective\nmultilateralism depends much more on political will\nand shared goals than on structures and procedures.\nThe multilateral system \u2014 which demands\nresponsibility and commitment \u2014 is judged by the\nresults it enables us to achieve. That is why the whole\ninternational community must be involved, starting\nwith the States that command greater resources and\ncapabilities. Multilateral decisions can be difficult, but\nthat is no excuse for inaction.\nThe starting point for United Nations reform is a\nreview of the Organization\u2019s policies. Italy welcomes\nthe reform of United Nations peacekeeping and peace-\nbuilding, which we \u2014 as the sixth largest contributor to\nthe United Nations budget and one of the top contributors\nof troops to peacekeeping operations over the past 10\nyears \u2014 support. Strengthening that critical sector will\nhelp to prevent the recurrence of conflicts, to consolidate\nthe gains of peace, to re-establish the rule of law and to\nguarantee freedom for all. Italy will also continue to\nsupport the growing financial, operational and training\ndemands of new missions, particularly in Africa \u2014\nhere, I am also thinking about the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development \u2014 and elsewhere.\nCrisis management is a United Nations priority\nthat demands greater coordination of its components\nand a stronger commitment on the part of Member\nStates to protect human beings and to uphold their\ndignity. We thus look forward to the report of the Panel\nof Eminent Personalities appointed by the Secretary-\nGeneral. The membership will have to examine it and\ndiscuss its recommendations thoroughly and openly.\nA firm agreement on the policies of the United\nNations must be upheld by institutions that enjoy the\nconsensus and participation of the membership. We are\nencouraged by the results achieved so far with regard\nto improving the functioning of the General Assembly.\nOn Security Council reform, we have not yet\nbeen able to find an agreement that reconciles the\nvarious approaches on the table. That should not deter us\nfrom seeking solutions that are not divisive. Any decision\nimposed upon Member States would seriously undermine\nthe credibility of the Council and the legitimacy of its\naction. Confronted with global challenges of great\nmagnitude, the international community cannot afford\nprofound divisions within its ranks.\nItaly is in favour of a Security Council reform\ninspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness,\neffectiveness, democratic participation and geographic\nrepresentation, starting with the developing countries.\nWe are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue\nsuch a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats.\nSince States would occupy those seats on the basis of\nperiodic elections, they would be accountable to the\ngeneral membership.\nSome Member States, however, have advocated\nthe addition of new permanent seats \u2014 for themselves.\nWe do not believe the Council\u2019s difficulties can be\nresolved through new permanent, irrevocable\nappointments and national mandates. Such a move\nwould sow division, frustration, and perhaps\ndisengagement, among the membership. Important\nareas of the world would be left without representation.\nFor one, there would be no seat at the Council table for\nthe Arab and Islamic world. Can the international\ncommunity really afford this at a time when we are\ntrying to broaden the dialogue among different faiths\nand cultures?\nOn the other hand, if a broad consensus emerges\nwith full respect for the sovereign equality of all\nMember States, we are willing to contemplate more\nfrequent rotation or longer terms for countries that\nmake a greater contribution to the objectives of the\nUnited Nations. Should reflections of the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change be driven by\nsuch a bold and innovative approach, we would\nstrongly support their endeavour. I am convinced that\nmany other countries would also be ready to accept it.\nIn addition, a closer relationship should be built\nbetween elected members and their regional groups.\nThat would enhance the accountability of elected\nmembers and would make the Council more\nrepresentative and its deliberations more legitimate.\nAlready in San Francisco in 1945 the founding\nfathers recognized the importance of regional\norganizations, whose relations with the United Nations\nare governed by Chapter VIII of the Charter, and\nwhose role has grown steadily in the years that\nfollowed. Increasingly, States belonging to the same\nregion have felt a sense of common responsibility for\ncrises affecting them all. Moreover, regional\n28\n\narrangements provide small to mid-size States with a\ngreater say in the decisions of international forums.\nMore should be done to express those realities at\nthe United Nations and in the Security Council. As a\nfounding member of the European Union, the\ndepositary of its treaties and the host for the solemn\nsignature of the new European Constitution, Italy\nbelieves that today\u2019s 25-member European Union has a\nfundamental contribution to make to the objectives of\nthe United Nations. We have always worked to allow\nthe European Union to speak with a single, more\ninfluential, voice. We realize, of course, that we are\ndealing with a gradual process. Nevertheless, we must\nstay the course and not jeopardize the achievement of\nour goal in the interests of all Europeans.\nLet me conclude with a final, strong appeal to\nStates Members. Let us join forces, abandon national\nambitions and seek the least divisive ways to enhance\nmultilateralism. That is the only way the international\ncommunity can meet the global challenges of the new\nmillennium. In deciding between the satisfaction of the\nfew and the inclusion of the many, the wrong choice is\na luxury that the United Nations \u2014 at the very heart of\nthe international system \u2014 can ill afford to make."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the United Arab\nEmirates, it gives me great pleasure to begin my\nstatement by congratulating you, Sir, and your friendly\ncountry, the Gabonese Republic, on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-ninth session of this Assembly.\nGiven your political skills and experience, we are\nconfident that you will competently and successfully\nlead our deliberations on pressing global and regional\nissues. We wish you every success in your endeavours.\nOn this occasion, I wish to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for his wise and\nskilful management of the activities of the previous\nsession. It also gives me pleasure to reiterate our\nappreciation and gratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for his\nconsistent efforts to strengthen the leading role of the\nUnited Nations, especially in resolving the political\nconflicts and economic crises that continue to plague\nour world.\nNotwithstanding the achievements of the last\ncentury and their positive impact on the principles of\nliberalization, globalization and freedom, recent\nevents, especially during the last few years, have\nincluded, violations of human rights, the outbreak of\nterrorist attacks and the eruption of violence and\nconflicts. These events have, to a great extent, limited\npeoples\u2019 ability to reap the benefits of most of these\nachievements. Instead of directing efforts towards\nsolving the problems related to poverty, the spread of\nepidemics, improving sustainable economic,\nenvironmental and social development mechanisms\nand strengthening international relations \u2014 as outlined\nin the Millennium Declaration \u2014 the world had to\ndevote a great part of its efforts to further exploring\ncoordinated measures for combating these grave\nthreats, which have shaken the underpinnings of\ninternational peace and security.\nPrevious experience has shown that regional and\ninternational multilateral initiatives built on principles\nof partnership, justice, transparency and equality\namong peoples and States can address and contain\nglobal challenges. Therefore, we are convinced that\ncarrying out the reform needed in the existing\nstructures of international relations, especially in the\nUnited Nations system, has become an important\npriority so that its principal organs \u2014 the Security\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Economic and\nSocial Council \u2014 can revitalize their activities and\nfulfil their responsibilities in terms of maintaining\ninternational peace and security.\nCommitment by all countries and governments to\ndischarge their responsibilities in accordance with the\nprinciples of international law is a key condition for\nenforcing the rule of law and avoiding potential\neconomic, environmental and security problems.\nTherefore, the United Arab Emirates, as a Member of\nthe United Nations, is committed to meet its\nobligations, especially those related to promoting\nfriendly relations with neighbouring countries,\ncooperation in the security and economic fields and\nrespect for the sovereignty, national unity and\nterritorial integrity and the right to self-determination\nof all countries.\nProceeding from its belief in the value of\ndialogue, peaceful negotiations and legal arbitration in\nsettling conflicts and disputes among countries, the\nUnited Arab Emirates has pursued a firm and peaceful\npolicy regarding the question of the occupation by the\nIslamic Republic of Iran of our three islands: Greater\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abou Moussa. The\ninternational community is now aware of the legal,\nhistorical and political grounds of this case, as well as\nall the initiatives, contacts and constant efforts by my\ncountry at various levels to find a peaceful solution to\nthis question.\nThe United Arab Emirates is perplexed at the\nposition of Iran and its constant rejection of all\npeaceful initiatives and endeavours by the member\nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council to find a\npeaceful solution to this important issue. Therefore, the\nUnited Arab Emirates calls upon the international\ncommunity to urge Iran either to clarify its intentions\ntowards the United Arab Emirates by entering\nunconditionally into serious bilateral negotiations\nwhich ensure restoration of the three occupied islands,\ntheir continental shelves and regional airspace and\ntheir economic zones to the full sovereignty and\nterritorial unity of the United Arab Emirates, or to\naccept referral of this case to the International Court of\nJustice for arbitration.\n44\n\nThe regrettable developments taking place on the\nsecurity front in the Arabian Gulf region have created\nserious challenges to the international community due\nto the sensitive nature of this region and the emergence\nof new forms of threats, which include terrorist acts,\nkidnappings and arbitrary killing of hundreds of\ninnocent people in various areas in Iraq and other\ncountries. In this context, the United Arab Emirates\nexpresses its strong condemnation of all acts of\nviolence in Iraq, which if not contained will lead to an\nescalation of tension and instability in the entire\nregion, as well as the world. We also express our\nsupport to the legitimate endeavours of the Iraqi people\nand their interim Government to complete\narrangements for a peaceful transition of authority as\nsoon as possible, to exercise their inalienable right to\ndecide their political future and internal affairs, control\ntheir natural resources, rebuild their national\ninstitutions and maintain security on their borders.\nWe also attach great importance to supporting\ninternational and regional efforts to help the Iraqi\npeople to rehabilitate their destroyed institutions, and\nto the unity and solidarity of the Iraqi people especially\nduring this critical stage, in order to enable them to\nstart a new phase in which security, stability, good-\nneighbourly relations and cooperation with all\ncountries of the world prevail.\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its strong\ncondemnation of all acts of terrorism in the Gulf\nregion, especially in the fraternal Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia and other areas where a number of residential\nareas were targets of horrific terrorist attacks. The\nUnited Arab Emirates declares its full support for the\ncontinuing efforts and measures taken by these\ncountries to combat those inadmissible acts, including\nthose by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia to defeat those criminal terrorist attempts inside\nSaudi territory.\nThe United Arab Emirates believes that\nsettlement of the Middle East question cannot be\nachieved with the position of a de facto situation of\noccupation, settlement, and siege of the Palestinian\npeople, who are now facing the worst humanitarian\ncrisis in their history because of the acts of arbitrary\nkilling, destruction, starvation and unjustified mass\ndetentions by the Israeli authorities. The United Arab\nEmirates affirms that continuation of the Israeli\naggression will inevitably lead to more violence and\ndeterioration in the security situation.\nWe therefore recall the historical, political and\nlegal responsibility of the United Nations and the\nQuartet, which is now responsible for finding a\nsettlement of the Palestinian question through obliging\nIsrael, the occupying Power, to unconditionally comply\nwith the terms of the road map and other relevant\ninternational resolutions, especially those issued by the\nInternational Court of Justice and the General\nAssembly that call for dismantling the racist separation\nwall in the West Bank, as it is considered illegal and\nnull and void.\nWe also affirm that establishment of a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region\ndepends on the ability of the international community\nto end Israel\u2019s intransigence, on revitalization of the\npeace process and on full Israeli withdrawal from all\nPalestinian and other Arab territories occupied since\n1967, including East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan and\nthe Shab\u2019a farms. It depends also on the establishment\nof a Palestinian State with its capital at Al-Quds al-\nSharif, pursuant to the relevant international\nresolutions and the fundamentals of the existing Arab\npeace initiative, which is based on the principle of land\nfor peace. In that context, we also affirm the\nimportance of respecting the wishes of the Lebanese\npeople and of not interfering in its internal affairs.\nAttaining and maintaining balance in the security\nsituation in the Middle East and the Gulf region is\ntoday a matter of high priority. It requires a\ncomprehensive, non-discriminatory, confidence-\nbuilding policy that will lead to the elimination of all\nexisting arsenals of weapons of mass destruction as\npart of an international process of non-proliferation.\nHere, we look forward to the outcome of the recent\nvisit of the Director General of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to a number of\ncountries in the region, which was aimed at convincing\ntheir Governments to relinquish the nuclear arsenals\nthat pose a threat to neighbouring countries.\nIn that connection, we renew our appeal to the\ninternational community to take all necessary measures\nto compel the Israeli Government to accede to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) and to subject all its nuclear facilities to the\nIAEA international safeguards system, so that a zone\nfree of weapons of mass destruction can be established\nin the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East regions.\n45\n\nReports of the Secretary-General on the world\neconomic and social situation reveal that almost a\nbillion people lack food, drinking water, job\nopportunities, housing and educational, health and\nsocial services. The United Arab Emirates has a good\nrecord of providing development and relief assistance\nto many countries, and we believe that the international\ncommunity should address those challenges as its\ncommon responsibility, requiring complete fulfilment\nof the commitments and pledges made by developed\nnations at United Nations conferences and summits on\nsustainable development and on financing for\ndevelopment. Those pledges relate to increasing\nassistance to developing countries, rescheduling\nforeign debt, easing restrictions on foreign trade,\nincreasing foreign investment and providing access to\nmodern technologies for peaceful purposes. That would\nenable developing countries to share equally in the\nbenefits of globalization.\nFurther, we welcome current efforts to set up a\nglobal fund to end poverty by 2015. Here, we affirm\nthat there must be progress in negotiations on North-\nSouth cooperation and on coordination among regional\nand international organizations if we are to put an end\nto the negative effects of repeated financial and\neconomic crises and ensure steady assistance flows and\nthe stability of commodity markets. Policies and\nchoices to liberalize world trade and the world\neconomy must be reviewed from a development\nperspective, taking into account the concerns and needs\nof small countries and developing countries, and their\nright to attain development and participate in the\ninternational decision-making process. This would\nenable their economies to avoid stagnation and\nmarginalization, and would ensure the implementation\nof national programmes to diversify national\nproduction, develop human resources and reduce levels\nof unemployment, poverty and disease.\nWe hope that our deliberations at this session will\nhave a positive outcome that will enhance our\nperception of our common causes and buttress our joint\nefforts to create a prosperous world based on the rule\nof law and justice, a world in which tolerance, well-\nbeing and progress prevail."

        "file_text": "I wish I could begin\nthis address on a more optimistic note, but since we\nlast convened at the General Assembly one year ago,\nmany dramatic and disconcerting events have occurred\non the world stage. I refer in particular to the\nindiscriminate and brutal terrorist attacks on civilians\nall over the world: in Russia, Spain, Iraq, Israel, Saudi\nArabia, Indonesia and many other countries. I refer to\nthe targeting of children and their parents at schools,\non buses and on aeroplanes. I refer to the almost daily\nbomb blasts on busy city streets, in marketplaces and\nin residential apartment buildings. I refer to the sadistic\npride and relish with which terrorists have been filming\nthe shooting, throat-slashing and decapitation of their\nvictims.\nThe purposeful torture and killing of civilians is\none of the basest forms of human barbarity. It is a\ncrime against humanity, along with ethnic cleansing\nand genocide. Unfortunately, terrorism is not\ndisappearing from the news headlines of the twenty-\nfirst century. Instead, it is becoming the principal\nmethod of warfare used by disaffected groups seeking\nto achieve their political ends and to blackmail national\nGovernments. Nothing can justify the use of such\nmeans. Any seemingly noble ends can only be\ndiscredited by using terrorism to further them.\nFrequently, countries facing terrorist attacks have\nbeen using vastly superior military capabilities to strike\nhard at real or perceived terrorist targets. Too often,\nhowever, those strikes have had an undesirable side\neffect of their own: the further wounding and killing of\ncivilians and the additional destruction of property.\nSuch strikes have done nothing to diminish the deep-\nseated feelings of resentment of disaffected\npopulations. The events of the past few years, and\nindeed of the past few decades, point to the stark and\nsobering reality that the military option alone has not\nbeen effective in rooting out terrorism and that\nterrorism has not been an effective means for achieving\npolitical aspirations and goals.\nSuch never-ending cycles of killing and mounting\nmutual hostility will cease once and for all only when\nthe parties involved forsake the use of violence. In the\nMiddle East, Latvia views the road map for peace as\nthe only feasible means of obtaining a cessation of\nhostilities between Israelis and Palestinians. My\ncountry encourages the interested parties to do their\nutmost to de-escalate tensions and resume the peace\nprocess.\nIn Iraq, the United States-led coalition forces\nhave handed over power to an interim Government, but\nsecurity problems are hampering the reconstruction of\nthe country and threaten the viability of free and fair\nelections this coming January. The transition in Iraq\nwill require continued international assistance, and I\nencourage the United Nations to assume an active role\nin that regard.\nAfghanistan is due to experience its first ever\nelections next month. Latvia hopes that the historic\nevent will not be derailed by violent attempts to disrupt\nthe democratic process in that country. Latvia is ready\nto continue supporting international efforts to provide\npeace and security in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\nTen years after the human catastrophe in Rwanda,\nwe are again confronted with the systematic rape,\ntorture and killing of civilians, in the Darfur region of\nthe Sudan. Those crimes have occurred on such a wide\nscale that they might be classifiable as ethnic cleansing\nand genocide. Latvia welcomes the mediation efforts of\nthe African Union and encourages all parties involved\nto ensure that no further harm comes to the civilians of\nthe region. My country supports Security Council\nresolution 1564 (2004) of 18 September, which urges\nthe Sudanese Government to act decisively to stop the\nviolence.\nThe United Nations faces the prospect of\nestablishing a new peacekeeping mission in Sudan, in\naddition to the 17 field operations already on the\nground. During the past few months alone, two new\nMissions were established, in Burundi and Haiti, while\na third was expanded in C\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire. The United\nNations peacekeeping budget for next year may nearly\ndouble as a result.\nLatvia is deeply committed to the United Nations\nand to effective multilateralism as a central element of\nUnited Nations activities. Latvia believes that the\nUnited Nations must maintain its crucial role in the\nmediation of international disputes and that Member\n24\n\nStates must summon the collective political will to\nsupport the United Nations as a truly credible force for\npeace.\nThe Security Council has been the principal\nforum in which the countries of the world deliberate\ntogether on matters of peace and security. Latvia\nbelieves that the Open-ended Working Group on\nSecurity Council Reform must continue its activities\nand come forth with proposals on how to make the\nCouncil more representative of today\u00eds political and\neconomic realities, how to provide the Council with\ngreater legitimacy and how to render it more effective.\nA serious debate should be continued regarding the\nenlargement of the number of permanent and non-\npermanent members of the Security Council. Countries\nsuch as Japan or Germany can and should play an\nincreasingly stronger role in this framework in view of\ntheir substantial contribution to United Nations\nactivities and commitments.\nProposals for enhancing coordination between the\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\nand the Security Council have made little progress.\nOverlapping mandates and the duplication of efforts\ncontinue to reduce the efficiency of the United Nations.\nThe economic and social programmes of the United\nNations need to be reformed, as well. For example,\nwhy are the issues of the Economic and Social Council\nreviewed four times a year, when twice a year might be\nsufficient? Combined with the restructuring of the\nEconomic and Social Council's functional\ncommissions, such a reduction of redundancy in the\nreview process could free up vital financial and human\nresources for important economic and social\ndevelopment programmes in the developing countries\nthat need them most.\nLatvia recognizes the important role of the United\nNations and other international organizations in\npromoting worldwide development and reducing\npoverty. Having regained its independence only 13\nyears ago, Latvia is gradually completing the transition\nfrom a receiving to a donor country. We are grateful for\nthe valuable assistance that the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) has provided to our\ncountry since 1993, and we are pleased that UNDP has\nextended its mandate until the end of 2005. Although\nthe amount that Latvia is contributing to worldwide\ndevelopment assistance is not very large at the\nmoment, we are committed to allocating no less than\none third of 1 per cent of our gross national product to\ndevelopment assistance by 2006, as required of all the\nEuropean Union's member States.\nLatvia\u00eds priority areas for development\ncooperation centre around the promotion of democratic\nand civil societies, economic development,\nenvironmental protection and other issues in the\ncountries neighbouring the European Union,\nparticularly Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia,\nUkraine and Uzbekistan, to name some of the countries\nto which Latvia has already provided bilateral technical\nassistance.\nLatvia is eager to reduce the divides between the\ndeveloped and the developing world. The industrial\nsociety into which we were born has been\ncharacterized by the heavy machinery and tools that\nhave marked human progress over the last two\ncenturies. Now this society is evolving into an\ninformation and knowledge society, with innovation as\nan important engine of growth. Latvia has been\nactively involved in the United Nations World Summit\non the Information Society (WSIS) and considers it an\nhonor to chair the Preparatory Committee of the\nsecond phase of the Summit, which will take place in\nTunis in November 2005. The WSIS process should be\nan integral part of the international community\u2019s efforts\nto eradicate poverty as outlined in the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, which will be reviewed\nperiodically until 2015.\nAlthough the delegations here today come from\nmany different backgrounds, practice different faiths\nand speak different languages, all of us in this room\nshare the same desire to make our world a better,\ncleaner, more peaceful and more prosperous place to\nlive in. We share a world view on what it means to be a\nhuman and on the inherent value of each human life.\nThe more we strive to enshrine such values as\ntolerance, compassion and mutual respect, the more\nhuman and the more humane our societies will become."

        "file_text": "First\nof all, on behalf of the members of my delegation and\non my own behalf, I would like to congratulate you,\nSir, upon your election to the presidency of our\nAssembly. Your election is a great tribute to both our\nsubregion in Central Africa and to your country, the\nGabonese Republic. It is also a sign of recognition of\nyour abilities as a statesman and a guarantee of our\nwork\u2019s success. My thanks and my congratulations also\ngo to your predecessor and his team for their\ndedication and the enthusiasm with which they did a\ngreat deal of work \u2014 which was much appreciated by\nall \u2014 in a particularly tense environment marked by\nanimated debates about the Iraqi crisis.\nFinally, I would like to pay a particular well-\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, our brother Kofi Annan, whose\ncommitment and unceasing efforts to establish lasting\npeace and sustainable development in the world are\npraiseworthy. He can count on Chad\u2019s support for all of\nthe initiatives that he is still undertaking with courage\nand tenacity, particularly in dealing with the problems\nand conflicts in Africa, initiatives through which he is\nthus contributing to restoring our Organization\u2019s\ncredibility.\nA year ago, when we addressed this Assembly\nand reiterated our commitment to defend the great\ncauses of mankind, we took that opportunity to\ncondemn terrorism and all forms of blind violence and\nintolerance that could lead our world astray. We\nrecalled at the time that our States needed to apply the\nUnited Nations Charter in reacting to terrorist acts \u2014\nor acts considered as terrorist \u2014 that constitute a threat\nto international peace and security. We reiterate those\nappeals, and call again on the sense of responsibility of\nour States to act together to curb by all possible means\nthe major scourges that are such a dangerous threat to\nall mankind, physically as well as socio-economically.\n5\n\nWith respect to combating terrorism, the\nGovernment of Chad, for its part, is actively\ncooperating with the appropriate institutions of the\nUnited Nations, under Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), in order to strengthen its national\ncapacity to prevent and combat this scourge.\nThe past year for Chad, as for many African\ncountries, was a year of serious concerns regarding the\narmed conflicts raging everywhere \u2014 conflicts that\ntook peaceful populations hostage, destabilized our\nStates and continued to jeopardize the joint efforts\nbeing made to establish democratic institutions and\npromote socio-economic progress.\nLet us say, however, that the accomplishments\nunder the agenda that led to the re-election of the\nPresident of Chad, His Excellency Idriss Deby, for a\nsecond term are progressing at a reasonable rate in\nspite of various difficulties. This agenda, which is\nperfectly in line with the Millennium Development\nGoals, seeks to create, through good governance,\nconditions that are conducive to the strengthening of\npeace and stability in the country so that we can\npromote education and health for all social strata,\nemployment \u2014 particularly for the youth and\nwomen \u2014 and true synergy among the different forces\nand competencies arising from the various national\nentities. This must be done so that we can do an\neffective job in combating poverty and the great\npandemics, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. I recall\nhere that this agenda, in which the fight against\nilliteracy and ignorance is written in capital letters, is\nbased on the most important principles: peace, security\nand justice. Without these, it will not be possible to\nbuild a society in which universal values such as\ndemocracy and the respect for human rights are\nensured.\nIn addition, the task of adapting our legislation to\nnational and international realities was imposed on our\nnational representation meeting, which made a\ncommitment on 26 May 2004, to a procedure aimed at\namending some provisions of the Fundamental Law\nadopted by referendum on 31 March 1996. This\nprocedure, which will harmonize the Constitution with\nthe requirements of democracy and fundamental\nfreedoms, is in keeping with the final provisions of the\nConstitution, which itself authorizes the revision.\nIn this context of globalizing economies, in\nwhich the rules of the game are constantly being\nsubverted, in particular by the practice of the largest\nStates of subsidizing their own agricultural products to\nthe detriment of the poorer countries, all efforts to\nresolve these developmental problems have been\ninconclusive. Even a strict application by our States of\nstructural adjustment measures is still seriously\nthreatened by the double weight of foreign debt and the\ncomplexity of social problems. Those issues make it\npractically impossible to take action to stimulate\neconomic growth in the developing countries.\nWith the exception of oil resources, we are\nwitnessing an ongoing decline in export earnings due\nto fluctuating commodity prices on international\nmarkets, and losses, caused principally by the policy of\nproviding subsidies, continue to grow; yet States have\nbeen slow to help the least developed countries by\nmeeting the commitments they made at successive\ndevelopment conferences.\nHere, let me speak of the cotton initiative, whose\npurpose is to obtain compensation for harm caused by\nsubsidies that have been detrimental to the economies\nof cotton-producing African countries. It is\nincreasingly urgent to ensure respect for the laws of\ncompetition, which the States seen as the principal\ninitiators and defenders of free markets now seem to be\ndisregarding.\nAs if that were not enough, in addition to the\ninherent difficulties of the international economic\nenvironment, those very farmers are today confronting\na threat of an entirely different scope: the invasions of\nlocusts. This raises the spectre of famine throughout\nthe Sahelo-Saharan countries. Chad is in a natural\nreproductive zone for locusts and is also considered a\ncorridor for locust swarm migration.\nThe situation is of even greater concern because,\nin addition to the other difficulties, the areas exposed\nto locust invasion are the ones that are protecting the\nSudanese refugees. Our countries have taken the\nappropriate measures, thanks to the assistance of our\npartners; we have thus been able to deal with the\nprogress of the first locust swarms. However, the threat\nhas not disappeared.\nAt the risk of having to manage a humanitarian\ncrisis that could result from the destruction of food\ncrops by the locusts, we must mobilize financial\nresources and the necessary technical and logistical\nmeans while we still have the time, in order to curb the\nscourge. We thank the countries and international\n6\n\norganizations that have helped my country, and I take\nthis opportunity to reiterate my Government\u2019s appeal to\nthe international community for vigorous action\nagainst the threat of locusts. Responses to the appeal\nwill help us set up appropriate structures for preventive\naction.\nWhile speaking of natural disasters, I must\nmention the consequences of tropical depressions that\nare doing a great deal of damage and that have, in the\npast few weeks, claimed thousands of victims among\nthe populations of the Caribbean islands. We express\nour sympathy to those populations, and I would ask the\nwealthy nations to provide the needed assistance to\nhelp them recover from the disaster.\nIn addition to natural disasters, armed conflicts\ntoo play a part in exacerbating the social crises from\nwhich our people are suffering. In 2004, my country\nand the United Nations have engaged in intensive\ndiplomatic activity related, inter alia, to the\nhumanitarian and security situation along the border\nbetween Chad and the Sudan. That situation, which is\nthe result of a conflict between the rebels of Darfur,\nand the central Government in Khartoum, is of serious\nconcern to my Government. The scope of the hostilities\nand the violent excesses perpetrated against civilian\npopulations by the various parties to the conflict, have\nprovoked massive and continuous flows of Sudanese\nrefugees to the eastern and north-eastern regions of\nChad. That flow has consequences for our people and\nfor the environment, whose ecosystems were already in\na precarious state of fragility caused by the aridity of\nthe soil and the climate.\nThe President of the Republic of Chad quickly\nunderstood the consequences of the conflict and made\na commitment to help our brothers in the Sudan find a\npeaceful solution, by offering to mediate between the\nparties. He personally initiated the inter-Sudanese\nnegotiations on the Darfur conflict, with the signature\nof the Abeche Agreement on 3 September 2003. That\nprocess was followed by the 8 April 2004 N\u2019Djamena\nagreement on a humanitarian ceasefire, and the\n25 April agreement on a joint commission; these will\nprovide a framework for negotiations on a final and\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict.\nIn other words, we could not remain indifferent to\nthe tragedy that the people in Darfur were\nexperiencing. It is our duty, more than any other\ncountry, to help our brothers in the Sudan to reconcile.\nWe have spared no effort to help President Omer\nHassan A. Al-Bashir and his Government, while\nrespecting the sovereignty of their country, to resolve\nthe Darfur conflict.\nThus, we took the risk of exposing ourselves to\ncriticism from the rebel movements, which accused us\nof favouritism, as well as the discontent of the Chadian\npeople related to the people of Darfur. This clearly\ncontradicts the widespread disinformation claiming\nthat the Government of Chad might have supported\nsome kind of rebellion against the legitimate\nauthorities of the Sudan, with which our country has\nclose ties of friendship and cooperation in all areas. We\nwill never stop fulfilling our mission to mediate\nalongside the African Union to urge our Sudanese\nbrothers to renounce war once and for all and to\npromote sincere dialogue in order to resolve the\nconflict.\nIn spite of the recent uncertainties due to the\nhardening of positions, we place our hope in the Abuja\ntalks under the auspices of His Excellency President\nOlusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\ncurrent Chairman of the African Union. We believe\nthat the adoption of Security Council resolution 1564\n(2004), whose full implementation by the Government\nof the Sudan is expected in order to facilitate\nconditions conducive to the return of populations to\ntheir homes, will be followed by complementary\nmeasures aimed at convincing the other parties to the\nDarfur crisis to take a constructive approach at the\nnegotiating table. We hope that the international\ncommunity will be firm with all sides in order to\npromote a successful conclusion of the process of a\npolitical settlement of the Darfur crisis.\nThroughout the terrible times the populations\nalong the border of Chad and the Sudan have endured,\ninternational solidarity has been evident. I must\nexpress the appreciation of the Government of the\nRepublic of Chad for the many forms of assistance we\nhave received from the international community, which\nhas allowed us to help the refugees.\nI would also like to call upon States and\norganizations represented here to convey to the\nappropriate authorities in their countries and\norganizations an appeal to continue or renew\nhumanitarian assistance to the refugees, whether from\nsouthern Sudan or southern Central Africa, whom we\nare sheltering in the south of our country.\n7\n\nI would also like to ask the international\ncommunity to help the populations of the host regions\nnot only to provide shelter for the refugees but also to\nmake possible the reconstruction of their\nsocioeconomic structures that have been affected by\nthe unexpected flow of refugees. The flow of refugees\nand their prolonged stay in Chad would \u2014 if we are\nnot careful \u2014 have consequences which might be\ndangerous to the security of my country.\nHaving agreed to abide by the international\ncommitments it has freely entered into, Chad is\nreceiving the refugees and looking out for their safety.\nIn the long term, the international support that my\ncountry enjoys should focus on promoting the\nvoluntary return, within a short and reasonable time, of\nrefugees to their countries of origin. International\nassistance to refugees must therefore be designed and\nconducted so as not to perpetuate the presence of the\nrefugees in Chad.\nWhile we are working together with the\ninternational community to ease the pain of the\nrefugees on our soil, we say frankly that we can in no\nway tolerate Chad being used as a base for subversive\nactions, for acts of terrorism or for the conduct of\nhostile or destabilizing actions against the institutions\nof the refugees\u2019 countries of origin. Thus, the\nGovernment of Chad will act, with all the unambiguity\nreflected in its current position, against refugees who\nbecome involved in such activities.\nThe gravity of the humanitarian and security\nsituation born of the crisis that is raging in Darfur has\nnot deflected my country\u2019s attention from other similar\nconcerns on the continent. We are following attentively\nand with great interest the evolution of other conflicts\nthat are taking place in Africa and in other parts of the\nworld. We are pleased to see the efforts being made\nwithin the African Union and the United Nations to\nfind lasting solutions; we are available to help as best\nwe can. Therefore, the Government of Chad has\ndecided to respond to the needs outlined by the\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations by making\navailable to the United Nations a contingent of 150\nqualified men.\nOn this solemn occasion, how could we fail to\nrecall the unjust and undemocratic situation that\ncharacterizes the structures of our Organization? I\nwould like to say firmly that my country remains\ncommitted to the common African position regarding\nthe restructuring of the United Nations, including the\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council in\norder to ensure equitable representation of all regions.\nAll the initiatives taken by Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan regarding United Nations reform are much\nappreciated by my country, which awaits with interest\nthe outcome of the deliberations under way. The\nobjective is the revitalization of the United Nations.\nAll suggestions should help us to improve the\nperformance of the principal organs and the\nfunctioning of present and future funds and\nprogrammes.\nTo that end, my country would expect account to\nbe taken of the concerns and viewpoints of Member\nStates and groups of States that have been reiterated on\nmany occasions in the Assembly. Chad awaits with\nequal interest the outcome of the study on\nglobalization: the current characteristics and direction\nof globalization by no means enable weaker or\ntransitional economies to benefit fully from the\nopportunities it offers.\nAnother injustice should be pointed out. I must\ndraw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the question of the\nexclusion from our ranks of a large community of the\n23 million men and women of the Republic of China\non Taiwan. Those men and women, who increasingly\nare asserting themselves in international trade and are\ngenerating wealth throughout the world, deserve to be\nfully associated in decision-making on subjects and in\nareas with an impact on their lives and those of all\nhumankind. The United Nations would have everything\nto gain and nothing to lose with their active\nparticipation in debates on the many topics of\ninternational concern. Their contribution would\nundoubtedly enrich the Assembly debates and would\nhelp us build the operational capacity of our world\ninstitutions, funds and programmes.\nThe distressing legacy of armed conflicts\nincludes buried caches of abandoned munitions and\nunexploded ordnance and, in particular, anti-personnel\nmines. Referring to the danger of landmines, the\nSecretary-General has said that these abominable\nweapons, buried by the millions, are not only waiting\nsilently to kill or maim innocent children and women,\nbut their presence \u2014 or even the threat of the presence\nof one single landmine \u2014 can put a stop to crop\ncultivation, deprive an entire village of its livelihood\nand thus place one more obstacle along the difficult\npath to reconstruction and development. Chad is\n8\n\nactively participating in the preparations for the Ottawa\nConvention review conference soon to be held in\nNairobi and will continue to act to eliminate all of\nthese arms so as to attain the objective of an Earth\nwithout mines.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank,\nwithout exception, all the States and all the\nintergovernmental and non-governmental institutions\nthat have helped us establish and implement our\nhumanitarian demining programmes. We ask them for\ntheir continued generosity, and we ask them to extend\ntheir assistance to survivors among the victims of\nlandmines, to help design and implement programmes\nenabling these individuals to be reintegrated socially\nand professionally. I appeal to all United Nations\nMember States to join in this humanitarian undertaking\nby acceding to the Ottawa Convention banning anti-\npersonnel landmines."

        "file_text": "I would like, on behalf of\nmy delegation, to join previous speakers in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. At\nthe same time, I would like to extend our compliments\nto your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, as well as to the\nSecretary-General, for a job well done.\nIf there has been one consistent and predictable\narea of convergence in our debates during General\nAssembly sessions of the past, as well as during the\ncurrent session, it is the compelling need for a peaceful\nand stable world - a world where humankind lives in\nharmony, mutual tolerance and respect for the\ncollective benefit. For if we have peace and stability at\nthe national, regional and international levels,\nhumankind will be able to concentrate on the real\nissues of the development of this, our only world.\nNever before has our world been so insecure or\nfaced such enormous challenges. Sadly, this insecurity\nresults from man\u00eds inhumanity and his insensitivity to\nhuman life. Yet it is also through man's efforts that the\neffects of such challenges can and must be mitigated\nor - better still - defeated.\nIt is common knowledge that the root cause of the\nworld's insecurity today is international terrorism and\narmed conflict. Terrorist actions continue to haunt and\nto shock us. The recent murder of innocent, young,\ndefenceless school children in Beslan, Russia; the\nbombings in Indonesia; and daily killings in Iraq,\nPalestine and Israel, are simply too ghastly to\ncountenance. Equally, the recent massacres of men,\nwomen and children in refugee camps in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the\nSudan are not only dastardly in the extreme, but stand\nin stark contrast to everything that modern civilization,\nhumanity and morality espouse.\nOur world will continue to be insecure for as long\nas terrorists continue to be harboured and financed by\nsome States Members of the United Nations. We must\nrecognize that none of us is immune from terrorism.\nBut a more honest and practical solution would be for\nall States Members of the United Nations to commit\nthemselves not to harbour or finance terrorists and their\norganizations. In that way, terrorists would have no\nsafe haven, thus rendering it possible to chase them\nfrom pillar to post until terrorist organizations are\neliminated from our world.\nWe submit that yet another, equally pragmatic,\nsolution may be found in the answer to the question:\nwhat is it that drives an inherently good human being\nto commit such inhuman and senseless acts of State\nterrorism, organizational terrorism or individual\nterrorism? In short, we must confront the causes of\nterrorism, honestly and without malice to anybody.\nLesotho is deeply concerned by the fact that\narmed conflicts continue to cause suffering and hinder\neconomic growth in Africa and elsewhere. However,\nwe commend the United Nations for all its efforts\naimed at the elimination of human suffering in armed\nconflict situations. When, in July 2003, the Assembly\nadopted its historic resolution 57/337, on the\nprevention of armed conflict, it recognized that\nmultilateral cooperation, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, could be an effective means to prevent\narmed conflict and to address its root causes.\nFurthermore, it acknowledged the responsibility of the\nUnited Nations to stand up to the challenge of\npreventing, rather than just responding to, conflict.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express\nmy delegation\u00eds appreciation to the Secretary-General,\nfor the comprehensive report to be presented at this\nsession on the implementation of that important\nresolution.\nFor years now, the situation in Somalia has posed a\nthreat to international peace and security. The swearing-\nin of Somalia's transitional parliament on 22 August\n2004, in Nairobi, Kenya, paves the way for genuine\nrecovery for Somalia. In that regard, my delegation\ncompliments the Government of Kenya, the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Development, the African\nUnion and all other stakeholders for their efforts to\nbring about normalcy in Somalia. We must not allow\nthe momentum to decrease, or the process to be\nderailed by those who seek to fuel hatred, division and\nthe killing of the people of Somalia, including as a\nresult of the smuggling of arms, which takes place\ndespite the arms embargo.\nThe humanitarian and security crises engulfing\nthe Darfur region in the Sudan are a cause for serious\nconcern to all of us. A lot has been said about that\n12\n\ngrave situation, but not much has been done to contain\nthe humanitarian and political crises.\nHowever, my delegation is hopeful that words\nwill finally translate into action. We had hoped that,\nwith the help of the African Union mediators, the\nrepresentatives of the Government of the Sudan and the\ntwo rebel groups - the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA)\nand the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) - could\nbe persuaded to sign and respect the protocol on\nsecurity. We reiterate our call to all concerned parties\nto enter into negotiations. We wish to remind the\nGovernment of the Sudan that it is its primary\nresponsibility, first and foremost, to protect the civilian\nlife of its nationals.\nThe Great Lakes region remains politically\nvolatile. This situation has been exacerbated by the\nrecent massacre of refugees from the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo at the Gatumba refugee camp in\nwestern Burundi. We hope that the fact that the Forces\nfor National Liberation (FNL) have claimed\nresponsibility for the killings would make\ninvestigations easier.\nThe peace process in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo remains elusive, at a time when we had\nthought that the gains that had been made from the\nCongolese dialogue, in South Africa, could be\nconsolidated. We reiterate the call by the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for renewed commitment by\nthe Transitional Government in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, the Security Council and the\ninternational community to work in full partnership to\nsee the transitional process through to elections\nscheduled for 2005.\nIt is worth mentioning that, at the regional level,\nthe Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) heads of State or Government, at their recent\nsummit in Mauritius, mandated the SADC Organ on\nPolitics, Defence and Security Cooperation actively to\nremain seized of the situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nMy delegation has never condoned the killings of\nIsraelis by the Palestinians or of Palestinians by the\nIsraelis. We have always considered the root causes of\nthe problem in the Middle East, which is the illegal\noccupation of Palestinian lands by Israel. That problem\nhas been exacerbated by the construction by Israel of a\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory.\nThe International Court of Justice, the principal\njudicial organ of the United Nations, on 9 July 2004\nrendered its advisory opinion that such construction\nwas contrary to international law. We therefore appeal\nto Israel to implement the important resolution adopted\nby the General Assembly in view of the Court\u00eds\nadvisory opinion. Moreover, it is our submission that,\nunless and until the issue of the inalienable rights of\nthe Palestinian people is addressed vigorously, urgently\nand truthfully, peace and security will remain elusive\nin the Middle East.\nWe should perhaps recall that, four years ago, we\ngathered in this very Hall with hope for, and\nanticipation of, a better life for all humankind in the\ntwenty-first century, as we adopted the Millennium\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals.\nWe set time-bound and measurable goals for\ncombating, inter alia, poverty, hunger, disease, the\nspread of HIV and AIDS, illiteracy, environmental\ndegradation and discrimination against women.\nNeedless to say, we are today, as we were then,\ncommitted to the achievement of those goals.\nHowever, we did not anticipate that, as we\napproach the comprehensive review in 2005, the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic would have become the greatest\nthreat to life itself, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\nUndoubtedly, the HIV/AIDS pandemic threatens to\nrender futile and irrelevant all our efforts at the\nbetterment of humankind, including the attainment of\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\nAs early as the year 2000, Lesotho had declared\nHIV/AIDS a national disaster, and various measures\nwere being taken at the national level to control and\nmanage the pandemic. We have not been alone in that\nfight, fortunately. It is in that spirit that we wish to\nrecognize and appreciate the dedication of Mr. Stephen\nLewis, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for\nHIV/AIDS in Africa, and of Mr. James Morris, Special\nEnvoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa.\nThrough his advocacy, Mr. Lewis has helped\nLesotho start a robust programme of antiretroviral\ntreatment, while Mr. Morris\u00eds initiatives have ensured\nfood supply for vulnerable and orphaned children.\nInterventions of this nature give credence to the lofty\ndeclarations adopted at various international summits\non the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as they complement and\nstrengthen our own initiatives and limited resources.\nMy delegation reiterates the call for increased\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa\u00eds\n13\n\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the framework for achieving\nthe Millennium Development Goals in Africa. It is yet\nanother mechanism that will enable African countries\nto fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to eradicate poverty\nand to reduce the high unemployment rate.\nIn the same context, the Millennium Challenge\nAccount is indeed a worthy and commendable\ninitiative by the Government of the United States of\nAmerica to launch the least developed countries on the\nroad to sound and sustainable development.\nThe prevailing situations in Western Sahara and\nin Cuba continue to be of major concern. My de1egation\nwill \u00f3 because it must \u00f3 repeat the statement we have\nmade on many previous occasions: that the people of\nWestern Sahara have suffered long enough. We have\ntherefore noted with appreciation the latest\nreaffirmation by the Security Council of its support for\nthe 1991 settlement plan, allowing the nations of\nWestern Sahara to determine the future of the disputed\nterritory in a referendum. We hope that the referendum\nwill be held soon, and urge that this be the case.\nBy the same token, the unilateral economic\nembargo against Cuba is causing untold misery to the\npeople of that country. My delegation believes that,\nwhen two countries are at war with each other, or when\na country has been condemned by the international\ncommunity for gross misconduct, an economic\nembargo could be justifiable. However, we are not\naware that any war has been declared against Cuba, or\nthat the Government of Cuba has compromised or\nbroken international law. We therefore remain in the\ndark as to what might justify the victimization of\nmillions of Cubans by the unilateral economic\nblockade, for we contend that it is the sovereign,\ndemocratic and, indeed, sacred right of the people of\nCuba to determine the system of Government most\nappropriate for their country. Accordingly, we urge that\nnormalcy be restored to Cuba through the removal of\nthe economic blockade.\nThe coming into operation of the International\nCriminal Court signifies, in our view, an end to\nimpunity. We are elated that there now exists an\ninternational body that can take over when national\ncourts are unable or unwilling to try perpetrators of the\nmost egregious violations of human rights. We would\nindeed live in a safer world if State parties to the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court adhered to\nit, and if the Court attained universal jurisdiction. My\ndelegation encourages States that have not yet ratified\nthe Statute to do so as a matter of urgency \u00f3 indeed,\nas a matter of common sense.\nWe are pleased to note that the ICC has\ncommenced investigations in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo and Uganda. We congratulate both these\nsister countries for their cooperation with the ICC.\nIn order for the United Nations family to address\ntoday\u00eds challenges effectively, the Organization must\nbe reformed, with the Security Council being the\ncentral focus of that effort. The Security Council must\nreflect the reality of the international community in the\ntwenty-first century. That must be done against the\nbackground of multilateralism, upon which international\npeace and security is premised. In that regard, allow me\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession, for the hard work and commitment he\ndisplayed as the Chair of the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Reform of the Security Council.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that it is only\nthrough solidarity, unity of purpose and honesty among\nus Member States that the United Nations will defeat in\nour time the greatest challenges ever to face\nhumankind. Otherwise, as Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan stressed in his opening statement, history will\nindeed judge us harshly."

        "file_text": "My delegation congratulates\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency. We\nhave every confidence that the fifty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly will enjoy success under your\nleadership. We would also like to acknowledge the\ngood work of your predecessor, Minister Julian Hunte\nof Saint Lucia, whose efforts led to a new level of\nenthusiasm within the General Assembly. In addition,\nwe recognize the tireless efforts of our Secretary-\nGeneral.\nEvents of the past months impel us to ponder the\nimportance of our Organization in the never-ending\nstruggle to secure a peaceful and dignified future for\nthe world. The United Nations was born to promote\nthose values that would unite humanity \u2014 values of\nfreedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for\npeoples and for nature \u2014 and thus transcend the\ndifferences of the world\u2019s cultures. And so it is these\nUnited Nations large and small come to find, in the\nwords of our Secretary-General, common solutions to\ncommon problems. And so it is that we the Member\nStates must ensure that the United Nations is effective\nfor our ends.\nIn Belize we understand that and remain a\nlegitimate partner in promoting principles such as\npeace, the right to self-determination, social justice,\nrespect for human dignity, the rule of law, the right to\ndevelopment and the protection of our environment.\nWe stand for those principles not just because of\nthe international instruments we signed, but because\nthey represent the best way to end poverty, illiteracy,\nhate and ignorance, to stop the spread of terrorism and\nto bring an end to inequality, oppression, and injustice.\nFor the overwhelming majority in the United\nNations, the solution to many of the world\u2019s problems\ncan be found in the right of every nation to achieve\nmeaningful sustainable development. Accomplishing\nsuch goals is not easy, but neither is it impossible.\nChallenges to development abound \u2014 challenges\nthat make us inherently vulnerable \u2014 and we as small\nStates call on the international community to take into\naccount our vulnerability so as to ensure that policies\nand measures relating to development correspond to\nour social needs.\nAs a member of the Alliance of Small Island\nStates, my country underscores the importance of\naddressing the special needs of such States through the\n18\n\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States. An international meeting, which\nwill conduct a full and comprehensive 10-year review\nof the Barbados Programme of Action, will be held in\nMauritius in January 2005, providing an opportunity\nfor the international community, especially the bilateral\nand multilateral donors, to renew their commitments to\nthe Barbados Programme of Action.\nOf special importance to us all is the issue of\nclimate change, and we must not flinch from taking\neffective measures to address that problem; those who\nseek to block effective solutions are creating conditions\nfor insecurity that would dwarf the threats currently\nposed by terrorism.\nIn that context, we remind Member States of the\nproposals first submitted to the General Assembly in\n1999 to designate the Caribbean Sea as a \u201cspecial area\u201d\nwithin the context of sustainable development. The\nrecent spate of hurricanes that have devastated our\nregion \u2014 especially Grenada and Haiti \u2014 and which\ncall for major efforts from the international community\nto mitigate our losses, reinforce our contention that our\nCaribbean Sea is as fragile as it is vulnerable and as\nfragile as it is valuable to our social and economic\nwell-being, indeed to our very survival.\nWe call upon the Assembly to support us in our\njust efforts to achieve the designation of the Caribbean\nSea as a \u201cspecial area\u201d during this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nIn addition to addressing the special needs of\ndeveloping countries, development policies must,\nabove all, be people centred. Coherent policies,\nsustainable partnerships, sustained support and\nownership are critical factors for development. That\nhas never been as clear as in the case of Haiti. In the\nwords of our Secretary-General,\n\u201cthe international community failed to develop ...\nsustainable partnerships with the Haitian society\nat all levels. The Haitian people were\ninsufficiently involved in the development of\npolicies that could move the country forward. ...\nFinancial aid did not bear fruit to the extent\nexpected because it was at times ill-targeted ...\u201d\n(S/2004/300, para. 6).\nWith the lesson thus learned, we have an opportunity to\ninfluence a positive wave of development for the\npeople of Haiti.\nIn Haiti, we also have a clear example of the\ninextricable linkage between development and security.\nThere, threats and challenges to peace and security\nnecessitate an integrated approach. My country hopes\nthat the Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on\nThreats, Challenges and Change will embrace that\napproach in its findings and recommendations.\nWhile we condemn terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations and have joined international efforts in\nthe fight against terrorism, we are mindful that our\nactions for the preservation of peace and security must\nbe consistent with international law and must be\nrespectful of the human rights and freedoms of all\npeoples without discrimination, foremost among which\nmust be the right to self-determination.\nFor that reason, we shall remain strong\nproponents of the right of the Palestinian people to a\nsecure and viable State. It is also for the same reason\nthat we support the Taiwanese people\u2019s right for\nrepresentation before the United Nations.\nBut what United Nations? Last year our Minister\nof Foreign Affairs confined his remarks to an urgent\ncall for the United Nations to recall and enforce the\nprinciples on which it was founded, basic among which\nis the principle of multilateralism \u2014 the most\nfundamental conviction that led to its creation: that\nStates, on the basis of sovereign equality, conjointly\ntake decisions that secure a peaceful and prosperous\nworld for all.\nTragically, events since then have only\nexacerbated the problem whereby powerful States take\nthe law into their own hands and act in total disregard\nof the principles of the United Nations Charter and\nindeed of international law. If we do not act together to\nreverse that evil trend, we are walking \u2014 nay,\nrunning \u2014 on the road to perdition.\nYes, we support the call of India, Japan, Brazil\nand Germany for a permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil, if there must be permanent seats. And to this\nwe would add the equally legitimate right of African\nand Arab nations to be so represented. But the reforms\nmust go deeper. Why should any one country have a\nveto power? Why should millions of the wretched of\nthe earth be left without an effective voice and be\n19\n\npowerless to change the world to a more just one? And\nwhy do we, who so effectively acted to end apartheid\nin South Africa, tolerate the equally opprobrious\napartheid practised by the State of Israel against\nPalestinians in their own land, murdering and\noppressing them without mercy and with impunity?\nThe year 2004 has been declared the International\nYear to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and\nits Abolition. Slavery was based on an exacerbated\nracism; so let us honour that struggle by implementing\nthe Final Declaration of the World Conference against\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\nIntolerance, held in South Africa in 2001.\nLikewise we continue to support United Nations\nefforts to bring greater visibility to the problems of the\nworld\u2019s indigenous people during the International\nDecade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People. As the\nInternational Decade draws to a close later this year we\ncall for a second decade to continue the work achieved\nduring the first decade and so to carry out and\ncomplete the work that has not yet been completed.\nIn our own community of small States, we face\nthe most serious threat to our peoples\u2019 security, caused\nby the proliferation of small arms and light weapons\nthat claim the lives of so many of our people. These\narms come from countries that must be called upon to\nlive up to their responsibility to cooperate with us to\nstem the flow of these lethal weapons and to enter into\nlegally binding agreements for the effective\nregistration and monitoring of transfers of these\nweapons of widespread destruction. An international\nconvention to achieve this must be put on our agenda\nurgently.\nAnother major issue for our region is the\ncontinued attempt to isolate the sister Caribbean\nRepublic of Cuba and to strengthen an economic\nembargo that has been condemned repeatedly by the\noverwhelming majority of this Assembly. The entire\nCaribbean Community is at one in its resolve to engage\nCuba in a constructive and mutually beneficial\npartnership that brings concrete benefits to all our\npeoples. The Cuban Government has, by its actions,\nmanifested its determination to fight against terrorism\nin all its forms and from every quarter. For us in the\nCaribbean, any call for \u201cregime change\u201d imposed from\noutside violates every principle upon which the United\nNations Organization stands.\nBelize has its own cause to promote. The United\nNations is well aware of the age-old and unfounded\nterritorial claim of Guatemala, and it has clearly and\nunanimously called for respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Belize. We have endeavoured to\nnegotiate a just solution to this claim for decades, and\nin the last four years we have been engaged in a\nprocess under the auspices of the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS), aimed at bringing this\nanachronistic claim to an end. Agreements have been\nmade and broken, in the context of a Guatemala that\nhas proclaimed its desire to find a peaceful solution to\nthe dispute. Still no solution is in sight. The worst\nscenario is for the claim to linger unresolved, thus\naffecting the security and development of our people.\nWe welcome the remarks of President Berger of\nGuatemala before this Assembly on 22 September,\nwhen he advocated a final settlement of the dispute,\nalong with cooperation between our two countries to\nimprove the socio-economic conditions of both our\npeoples. We certainly support this approach and will do\nour part, as we have always done, to achieve those\nnoble goals. But cooperation does not substitute for\nresolution of this age-old threat to the security and\nprosperity of our people. We will, therefore, continue\nto work within the OAS to develop an agreed process\nthat will bring finality to this matter, which will\nundoubtedly redound to the benefit of the peoples of\nboth Belize and Guatemala and contribute to the peace\nand security of the region. In the search for bringing\nthis longstanding dispute to an end, we place high\nhopes on the role of the Group of Friends that has been\nagreed by both parties to reach this objective, and we\nlook forward to its greater input and support to the\nprocess.\nThe challenges we face in the world today are not\nall unique to our generation. Some are the result of our\nrefusal to learn from the mistakes of the past; others\nare entirely of our making. Yet, if we are to look at\nthose values that unite us and we are determined in our\ndesire for good, we will find that working together\nbrings us ever closer to amore just and peaceful world."

        "file_text": "I would like to extend to the\nGeneral Assembly the warm greetings and good wishes\nof the Government and people of the Republic of the\nFiji Islands. I would also like to warmly congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency\nof the fifty-ninth session. I pledge to you our support\nand cooperation. That reflects our respect for your\ncountry, with which we have enjoyed close relations\nthrough our common membership of the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific partnership with the European\nUnion. I also wish to express Fiji\u2019s warm thanks to\nMr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia for his very able\nleadership of the fifty-eighth session. Fiji and other\nsmall island nations of the Pacific region applaud the\nfine example set by the countries of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) in their shared approach to\nmanaging the responsibilities of that high office.\nToday we are confronted by events that cast a\nshadow over humankind and the United Nations vision\nof peace. The humanitarian crisis in Sudan continues. As\nrelief efforts proceed, our thoughts are with the refugees\nof Darfur. We urge the Government of Sudan to do\neverything in its power to bring that tragedy to an end.\nWe think of those whose lives have been\ndevastated by the destructive fury of hurricanes in the\nCaribbean and on the Atlantic coast of the United\nStates. We extend to them our deepest sympathies for\nthe loss of life and property.\nThe perpetrators of the slaughter of innocents in\nRussia gave a new dimension to wickedness. They\ndefeated their own cause through the ruthless and\nindiscriminate shedding of the blood of children.\nNothing can justify what they did. The United Nations\nmust be united against such infamy.\nLet us express our sympathy and solidarity with\nthe ordinary people of Iraq caught in that country\u2019s\nterrible cycle of violence. Let this forum give them our\nfull and unreserved support in the struggle for genuine\ndemocratic Government and the regaining of their\nnational sovereignty. May their hopes for a peaceful\nfuture and lasting stability find fulfilment.\nWe feel for the families of the people killed by\nterrorists outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta. We\n12\n\nwant them to know that their pain is shared in this\nfamily of nations.\nThe plea from Fiji is for United Nations member\ncountries to strengthen their joint resolve to oppose\npolitical terror everywhere. This is a critical time in\nhistory. The United Nations is called upon to mobilize\nall its experience, skills and powers to create concord\namong nations. That was its founding principle. It is\nthe principle that must continue to drive and sustain the\nUnited Nations.\nFiji, as always, is committed to the maintenance\nof peace and security and to a world free of weapons of\nmass destruction and terrorism.\nWe want an end to ozone-depleting pollution and\nthe elimination of other hazards to the environment.\nThe international community must continue to\nfight poverty and disease. HIV/AIDS has become more\nthan a health crisis. For some countries it is now a\nsecurity threat. We in the Pacific have no immunity\nfrom this global epidemic. We would welcome\ncontinued assistance from the Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to supplement our\nregional campaign to contain this scourge.\nThe United Nations must continue to resist\nexternal interference in any form, which undermines\nthe sovereign right of every Member State to determine\nits own destiny. However, where there are internal\ncrises and disorder and the United Nations mandates\nintervention for peace, we are ready to contribute. We\nconsider it an honour to serve the cause of peace under\nthe flag of the United Nations and regional\norganizations like the Pacific Islands Forum. Fiji\u2019s\nsoldiers and police officers have been taking part in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations since 1978.\nThat has cost us 35 precious lives, but we remain\nstrong in our resolve to continue serving where we are\nneeded. Peacekeeping personnel from Fiji are working\nin Liberia, the Sinai, Kosovo, Timor-Leste, the\nSolomon Islands and Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.\nMy Government is now giving careful consideration to\nrequests from the United Nations to assist it with\nsecurity personnel in Iraq.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express to\nthe United Nations and to those countries that have\nassisted Fiji on a bilateral basis our gratitude for their\nhelp in making it possible for us to honour our\ncommitment to international peace and security.\nThrough the Pacific Islands Forum, and with the\nassistance of Australia and New Zealand, we are\ncurrently preparing a Pacific plan to pool resources and\nefforts for the strengthening of collective interests. We\nwill come together to combat the threat of terror and to\nimprove law enforcement and our defences against\nterrorism and transnational crime. There will be a\ncooperative approach to social and economic\ndevelopment, and especially for advancing trade,\ninvestment and tourism. We will stand united to guard our\noceanic heritage, which is a treasure for all humanity.\nOur region has the world\u2019s largest remaining,\nsustainable tuna fishery, which is an essential source of\nfood for the global market. But more than 95 per cent\nof the value of the mid-Pacific Ocean tuna catch goes\nto distant-water fishing nations. We look to the United\nNations and other international organizations to help us\nget a just return from that major natural resource. Fiji\ncommends those countries that have already worked\nwith us to reach that goal. We would like to express\nparticular thanks to the United States for its regional\nfisheries treaty with certain Pacific island nations. Our\nisland countries have now entered a new phase of\ncooperation in the tuna industry through the Western\nand Central Pacific Tuna Convention, which came into\neffect in June this year.\nIn addition to reinforcing regional cooperation,\nFiji and its neighbours are giving special attention to\ntheir relationships with countries in the wider Asia-\nPacific region.\nWe strongly support a role for Japan and India in\nan enlarged and strengthened Security Council. May I\nalso add that Fiji would endorse the inclusion of South\nAfrica and Brazil as permanent members.\nLet me say that we greatly value the assistance of\nAustralia, New Zealand and the United States in\nsecuring our region as a zone of peace.\nIt was heartening to see the two Koreas marching\nand participating under a single banner at the Olympic\nGames in Greece. It is our prayer that that will lead to\nmore substantive progress in the reunification of the\nKorean people.\nWe are glad to see the People\u2019s Republic of China\ngrowing in stature and developing so quickly. Fiji enjoys\nsteadily strengthening relations with China and wants to\nsee those relations expanded further. It is committed to its\ndiplomatic recognition and official relations with the\n13\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. At the same time, Fiji values\nits trade and economic ties with Taiwan. It is our fervent\nhope that their people will resolve their future\npeacefully through dialogue and consensus.\nFor the past 29 years, close to 80 countries of the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP) have been\nthe beneficiaries of a historic development partnership\nwith the European Union. I pay tribute to the leaders of\nEurope and the ACP who pioneered that unique\ninternational North-South arrangement. Generous\nassistance in trade, aid and investment has contributed\nin very significant ways to the livelihood of millions of\npeople from poorer States.\nNow, as we begin negotiations with the European\nUnion for the continuation of those arrangements, we\nare finding to our dismay that the World Trade\nOrganization\u2019s (WTO) insistence on free and open\ntrade will effectively mean for many ACP countries,\nincluding Fiji, a massive loss in export earnings from\nreduced prices. For our sugar industry the direct\nconsequence will inevitably be that the price the cane\nfarmers receive will fall substantially below their\nproduction costs. That is despite the urgent and\ncomprehensive reforms we have embarked upon in our\nsugar industry to make it more productive, efficient\nand competitive.\nThose WTO hurdles are made more difficult by\nthe loss of competitive margins through the withdrawal\nof schemes like the Generalized System of Preferences.\nThe consequence is that many small island developing\nStates, already disadvantaged by their smallness,\ndistance from export markets and regular devastation\nfrom natural disasters, are now faced with serious\nuncertainty over their economic prospects. We\ntherefore welcome the holding by the United Nations\nof a special conference of small island developing\nStates early next year to review the Programme of\nAction for those countries, the Barbados + 10 review. I\nvery much hope that review will lead to new\ninternational commitments of assistance to\ndisadvantaged small island developing States. Those\ncommitments must underpin economic survival and a\nsustainable future, as the world moves inexorably\ntowards a free and open trading system. It is also our\nhope that the Barbados + 10 review will renew the call\nfor those States that have yet to sign or to ratify the\nKyoto Protocol to do so, for the sake of our planet.\nMy Government commends the initiative taken\nby the International Labour Organization in its World\nCommission Report on the Social Dimension of\nGlobalization. It is the international community\u2019s\nresponsibility to ensure that for both developed and\ndeveloping countries, and for big and small countries\nalike, globalization means a fair and equitable spread\nof opportunities \u2014 opportunities manifested in new\ninvestments, more jobs, decent work and improvements\nin education, health and other social amenities.\nFor us in the Pacific, as small island nations,\nthere is another area of increased concern. We take\ngreat pride in our culture, customs and traditions. They\ngive us our identity and oneness as indigenous\ncommunities and as Pacific island peoples. I appeal to\nthe General Assembly to bring before it for adoption at\nthe earliest opportunity the draft declaration on the\nrights of indigenous peoples. I request the Secretary-\nGeneral to expedite that process.\nWhile we acknowledge the importance of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other\ninternational instruments in the promotion of human\nrights, we also recognize that they are primarily\nconcerned with the rights of individuals. Indigenous\nPacific island communities see a United Nations\ndeclaration on the rights of indigenous peoples as\nbeing vitally important for the international recognition\nand acceptance of our right to self-determination and,\nindeed, to our very survival as ethnically and culturally\ndistinct peoples. But that is not to say that we are\nunconcerned about other communities whose members\nare fellow citizens with equal rights and responsibilities.\nMembers of the Assembly are aware that Fiji has\na multiracial society. The ethnic Fijians and Rotumans\nare the indigenous community. Collectively and\ncommunally, they own close to 90 per cent of all land\nin the country. Settlers from India came some 125\nyears ago and now comprise the majority of tenants of\nnative land. Europeans, people of mixed ancestry,\nChinese and other Pacific islanders complete Fiji\u2019s\ncolourful cultural tapestry. We are proud of that\nnational diversity. It gives our country its distinctive\ncharacter and its still unrealized potential.\nAlthough we have learned to co-exist without the\nracial violence and hatred common elsewhere, we are\nstill a country divided, especially in politics. From\nindependence, in 1970, we tried hard to create\nmultiracialism founded on mutual respect, mutual care\n14\n\nand understanding. But, unfortunately, during elections\nthe overwhelming majority of voters still make their\nchoices along ethnic lines. It is not because they are\nagainst candidates from other communities, it is just\nthat they find security and comfort in choosing\nrepresentatives from their own community.\nSince my Government came to office, in 2001,\nwe have been engaged in a new quest for unity. Our\nvision is for a peaceful, unified and prosperous Fiji.\nPolitically, we wish to build on the concept of\nguaranteed representation for our different\ncommunities in Parliament. The challenge now is to\nextend this to representation in Government.\nAs a parliamentary democracy, we are committed\nto Government based on the free will and consent of\nthe people. But, at the same time, we want to ensure\nthat each community has a direct voice in national\ndecision-making. It is that desire for inclusion and\nequity that has led us to adopt measures to close the\nsocial and economic gap between Fijians and the other\ncommunities and between the affluent and the\ndisadvantaged and the poor. Increasingly, we are\nfinding that faith in God is a powerful instrument for\nforming bonds across the racial divide. We may follow\ndifferent beliefs, but a common focus on the divine is\nlighting the way forward.\nWhen I return to Fiji, the country will be getting\nready for eight days of prayer, forgiveness and\nreconciliation. The aim is to bring people together and\nto create a sense of national purpose and patriotism.\nAll the great faiths represented in Fiji will be part of\nthat. Each contains in their teachings the jewels of\ntruth that gleam for all humanity. Each has an\nimportant capacity for peace-making. Each can make a\nvaluable contribution to increasing understanding and\nresolving differences.\nIn those eight days in October, therefore, our\nreligious leaders will join with other citizens of good\nwill in this fresh search for togetherness. The\npromotion of unity has been a pressing national\npriority since my Government came to office, four\nyears ago. We understand that it will not come quickly.\nThe General Assembly will be pleased to hear that our\ncommunities themselves, through their religious and\ncultural organizations, are coming forward to join with\nthe Government in the making of a unified State. The\nclimax of our national week of prayer and forgiveness\nwill be an interfaith service. We recognize that human\neffort alone is not enough for what we want to achieve.\nJust as this great Organization seeks a world of\nharmony bound together by common ideals, we in Fiji\nwant our own United Nations, a united nation where our\ncitizens live together happily and nationhood is fulfilled."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. I assure you of\nTanzania\u2019s support as you discharge your mandate. I\npay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for\nhis able stewardship of the work of the General\nAssembly. I commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, and his staff for their dedicated service and\ntireless efforts during a very difficult time.\nThe Millennium Development Goals represent\nour vision and hope for a new global partnership for\nshared global prosperity and security \u2014 an ideal at the\nvery heart of the United Nations. But we are still far\noff the mark in meeting many of them, especially in\nsub-Saharan Africa. We must further strengthen our\ncommon resolve to act in their resolute pursuit. In this,\nas in other things, actions speak louder than words.\nWe commend Denmark, Luxembourg, the\nNetherlands, Norway and Sweden for consistently\nmeeting the long-established United Nations target of\nallocating at least 0.7 per cent of the national incomes\nof rich countries to development cooperation. Those\ncountries have a broad national consensus on that\nmatter, and their people are not in any way poorer\nbecause of it. We urge the other rich countries to\nproduce timetables to meet that long-overdue target, to\nhave coherent development policies and to earnestly\nand deliberately build and nurture a national\nconsciousness and consensus on the global war on\npoverty. That war should now be a central political\nissue for all countries, rich and poor. Only then will the\npolitical will be generated to do more for the timely\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\nIt is true that money is not a panacea, but the\neighth Millennium Development Goal \u2014 to develop a\nglobal partnership for development \u2014 may actually be\nthe single most important key to unlocking new\ninitiatives and latent capabilities to enable us to attain\nthe Goals. And a genuine partnership implies shared\nrights and responsibilities as well as a shared\n19\n\ncommitment to be evaluated. I commend the\nGovernments of the Netherlands and Denmark for\nconducting, and making public, evaluations of their\nperformance in meeting their commitments under the\neighth Millennium Development Goal.\nOn our part, never before have so many African\nGovernments committed themselves to good\ndemocratic governance, to peer review, to ownership of\nthe development agenda and to the participatory\nprioritization and sequencing of the tasks necessary\nfor the attainment of the Millennium Development\nGoals. We now need an equally unprecedented\ncommitment \u2014 in deeds \u2014 to the global war on\npoverty in all rich countries. African countries doing\ntheir part in the global compact on poverty alleviation\nshould not be constrained by a lack of supportive\nexternal resources. At the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held at Monterrey,\ndeveloped countries pledged to match stronger reform\nefforts in developing countries with increased support.\nTanzania asks that they now show leadership by\ndelivering on their promises.\nWhen both rich and poor countries meet their\nobligations, tangible progress is realized. My country\nis an example. Our Primary Education Development\nProgramme, for instance, has recorded remarkable\nprogress. We now expect to attain the education\nMillennium Development Goal in 2006, nine years\nahead of schedule. Gender parity has been attained, and\nthe net enrolment ratio is already 90.1 per cent. Pass\nrates have doubled over the past four years. That was\nmade possible by an increased budgetary allocation to\nthe sector, by debt relief, by increased aid channelled\nthrough our own budget and by local ownership and\nparticipation. We are grateful for the cooperation we\nhave received from our development partners.\nTogether, we have shown what can be done where there\nis political will.\nYesterday, my colleagues and I launched the\nreport of the World Commission on the Social\nDimension of Globalization, entitled \u201cA fair\nglobalization: Creating opportunities for all\u201d. The\nreport is a contribution by commissioners with varied\nbackgrounds and experiences; it is also a reflection of\nthe views of many ordinary people consulted through\nnational and regional dialogues. It presents one\nimportant consensus: globalization has produced both\nstriking achievements and harmful distortions in global\ngrowth and development. We all agreed that, left\nunchecked, globalization will exacerbate the wealth\ngap within and between nations, thereby planting the\nseeds of social instability and crime on a national and\nglobal scale. But the report also presents the prospect\nof hope. Globalization, when properly governed, can\nbe a force for good \u2014 a catalyst for change and for\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals. I\ncommend the report to the Assembly.\nResponses to the challenges of globalization must\nbegin at home. Good governance, prudent monetary\nand fiscal policies, macroeconomic stability, peace and\nsecurity, the protection of property rights, setting\npriorities for poverty reduction and the creation of a\nconducive environment for investment and trade, both\nbetween Africans themselves and between Africa and\nthe rest of the world \u2014 all those are things that we in\nAfrica have agreed to address.\nBut I must stress one conditionality: no solutions\nto Africa\u2019s problems can be sustainable unless they are\ngenuinely embraced and owned by Africans\nthemselves. We have shown our new resolve to come\nto terms with our problems and to take the initiative\nand the lead in finding solutions. From our\ndevelopment partners, we ask in return for genuine\nrespect for our ownership and the policy space for local\ninitiative and leadership. We need policy space to deal\nwith problems such as conflict, ethnicity, land and\nagrarian reform and institution-building, and we need\nadequate, consistent and predictable external support to\nimplement the solutions we put forward.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo deserves\nour continued and strong support. Instability in that\ncountry robs the entire region of its potential for shared\nprogress, development and solidarity. The people of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo must continue to\nwalk down the path of peace, reconciliation and unity.\nThey and the Government of President Kabila need and\ndeserve our robust help. We commend President Mbeki\nand the South African Government for their efforts,\nand Tanzania pledges its unwavering support to them.\nIn Burundi, we commend President Museveni of\nUganda and the South African Vice-President,\nMr. Jacob Zuma, for their dedication to helping\nBurundi realize a new political and social dispensation\nof inclusive governance, development and peace. The\nRegional Initiative for Peace in Burundi has made\nstrenuous efforts to accommodate, through\nnegotiations, all the parties in a Government of\n20\n\nnational unity. Sadly, the Parti pour la lib\u00e9ration du\npeuple hutu-Forces nationales de lib\u00e9ration\n(Palipehutu-FNL) has refused to be part of that\nprocess. Its declaration of responsibility for the\nmassacres against innocent and unarmed refugees at\nGatumba was the proverbial last straw for us in the\nregion, so we took a stand and declared the FNL a\nterrorist group. We appeal for the Assembly\u2019s support\nin treating it as such.\nThe first international conference on the Great\nLakes region, which Tanzania will host in November\n2004, will review aspects concerning peace and\nsecurity, governance and democracy, economic\ndevelopment and regional integration, as well as\nhumanitarian and social issues in the region.\nUltimately, we hope to adopt a comprehensive security,\nstability and development pact for the Great Lakes\nregion. I thank the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes\nregion for supporting the preparatory process and\nappeal to the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to render their support to that process.\nThe humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is harrowing\nand demands urgent remedy. A humanitarian ceasefire\nagreement must be promulgated, presaging the\nevolution of a democratic and political culture. We\ncommend and support the effort by His Excellency\nOlusegun Obasanjo, President of Nigeria and African\nUnion Chair, and President Idriss Deby of Chad. We\nask for the practical, urgent and increased support of\nthe United Nations and the international community as\na whole for the initiatives of the African Union in\naddressing this tragedy.\nThe question of Western Sahara has dragged on\nfor too long. We fully support the right to self-\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara. It is the\nduty of this body to help them realize it. We support\nthe United Nations peace plan and call on all sides to\ncooperate fully in its speedy implementation.\nWhen the Middle East road map was put forward\nin 2003, we supported it, believing that it addressed\ncomprehensively the issue of the establishment of a\nviable Palestinian State living with the State of Israel,\nwith recognized and secure borders between them. It is\nregrettable that the road map has been put aside. In our\nview, the road map remains the most reasonable, viable\nand sustainable way of resolving this long-standing\nconflict. We condemn the cycle of violence and\nkillings and the use of excessive force. We urge that\nthe implementation of the road map be brought back on\ntrack.\nWe are living with the spectre of international\nterrorism: the most vicious and pernicious among\ninternational crimes. The people of Tanzania will never\nforget the terrorist attack directed at the American\nEmbassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998, which killed or\nwounded innocent Tanzanians. There should never be\nany doubt about our unflinching resolve to cooperate\nwith others in combating terrorism in all its forms.\nTanzania is a faithful and active Member of the\nUnited Nations, and we reaffirm our readiness to work\nwith our fellow Members in addressing global concerns\nin furtherance of the ideals of the Assembly and the\nCharter of the United Nations. It is, therefore, with\ndeep humility and gratitude that the United Republic of\nTanzania has secured the endorsement of the African\nUnion to seek a non-permanent seat in the Security\nCouncil. Our candidature will be placed before the\nAssembly for election later during this session, and we\nappeal for the full support of our candidature.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to ravage\nmany of our countries. As public awareness grows and\ntechnology improves, so do our chances of protecting\nthe most basic human right, the right to life. That right\ncan be enjoyed by our people if current and future\nadvances in science and technology are extended to the\nmany poor who are infected with HIV/AIDS.\nPreventive care, access to affordable drugs and the\nhealth delivery infrastructure in developing countries\nall need to be widened and strengthened. On this front,\ntoo, we need help.\nDemocratic governance is a universal norm,\nwhich has to be reflected also in the United Nations\nsystem. What is desirable for our individual countries\nmust also be true for the United Nations. Recent\ndevelopments in the reform agenda of the Organization\nmust therefore be expedited. Our hope is that the report\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange will bring forth recommendations for a firm\njump forward in the reconfiguration of the reform\nprocess.\nThe Security Council must be representative of\ntoday\u2019s wider membership of the United Nations and\nreflective of the current geopolitical and economic\nstructure of the world. There are countries in Asia,\nAfrica and Latin America that deserve permanent seats\nbecause of their major contribution to the sustainability\n21\n\nof the Organization and to global peace, security and\ndevelopment. The time to bring them in has come.\nMembers of the United Nations must uphold\nsteadfastly, in word and deed, the ideals of its Charter\nfor peace with justice and for security with\ndevelopment for all. These common aspirations are the\nfoundation of international law, of international order\nand of international cooperation. They also invest with\ncredible legitimacy our collective pursuit of the\nhappiness of humanity and the renewal of humanity\u2019s\nenvironment. Working together, we can ascend to the\nheights to which we aspire. Only then shall we leave to\ncoming generations a deserved legacy of a common\nfuture for all mankind."

We acknowledge that you are also\nfrom our Forum of Small States group and therefore\nshare our common problems and challenges. Please\nconvey my delegation\u2019s commendation to your\npredecessor, the Honourable Julian Hunte, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Saint Lucia, for his strong\nleadership of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession.\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his staff for\nthe good work they continue to do for our global\ncommunity.\nWe currently live in a changing world, one which\npast generations would even be amazed at. One of the\ngreatest achievements of the United Nations system is\nthe process of decolonization which has seen more than\n70 countries, including my own, take their rightful\nplace in this Assembly. The process will not be\ncomplete, however, until the remaining 16 Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories, including New Caledonia and\nTokelau, have exercised their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination.\nThe world continues to witness great leaps in\ntechnology, but at the same time we have also seen an\nincrease in some global dilemmas \u2014 poverty and\nhunger, the ravages of HIV/AIDS, wars, conflicts and\nterrorism, among others.\nEach of our countries face numerous challenges\nin this changing world and many of them are common\nto all of us, regardless of our size, location and status\nas developed or developing countries. Under the\ncircumstances, and more than ever before, we need to\nwork together as a community of nations to help each\nother address those challenges. Nowhere is that more\nevident than in the domain of international peace and\nsecurity. A terrorist act committed in one State today\nalso affects others elsewhere in the global community.\nWe condemn the recent tragedy in Beslan, Russia,\nthe bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and\nthe ongoing terrorist acts in the Middle East, Iraq, and\nother parts of the world. We also condemn the recent\n22\n\ntragedy in Darfur, the Sudan, and commend Canada\nand Japan for their generous assistance.\nIn circumstances like the foregoing, those most\naffected are innocent civilians, especially women and\nchildren. We therefore support the Secretary-General\u2019s\nefforts to rally the international community to\nsubscribe to the treaties on the protection of civilians.\nIn many cases, terrorists also take the lives of\nUnited Nations and other humanitarian workers who\nare doing unselfish and dedicated work under difficult\ncircumstances to serve our common humanity. In that\nregard, we urge all Member States to support the\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains\nintractable, requiring constant and deliberate attention\nby the United Nations, especially by the Security\nCouncil. Our own experience in the Bougainville\nconflict has taught us that there can be peace if all\nparties really desire it and are willing to resolve their\ndifferences. We therefore urge all parties to the conflict\nin the Middle East \u2014 including Israel and Palestine, as\nwell as the major players, particularly the Quartet \u2014 to\nformulate a peace plan that is mutually acceptable to\nall.\nPapua New Guinea concurs with Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan\u2019s recent statement to the\nAssembly at its 3rd meeting, which highlighted how\nimportant it is for the rule of law to prevail if we are to\nachieve peace and security in the world.\nLike many other Member States, Papua New\nGuinea has acceded to the various counter-terrorism\ntreaties, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001). We believe that the reporting obligations under\nthe provisions of those treaties should be streamlined\nto include regional reports, which would solve many\ncapacity issues for small nations with limited\nresources. Because many of our regional legal, military\nand law enforcement agencies meet regularly, those\nmeetings could provide the opportunity to compile\nregional reports on our fight against international\nterrorism. We believe that there is every desire to fulfil\ntreaty obligations; but if some of the more onerous\ntasks can be lightened for the small countries through\nregional reports, bodies like the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee, the Security Council, the General\nAssembly and other related agencies could be better\nserved.\nThe small States are doing their best to fulfil their\nobligations. Like many other Members States, we take\nseriously our responsibilities and obligations to fight\nthe scourge of international terrorism and related issues\nincluding the trafficking of people.\nThe Pacific region advocates that the United\nNations continue to closely and seriously study the\nnotion of collective security along with collective\naction, ideas upon which many of our actions to bring\nstability to our region continue to be based.\nWe are custodians of the biggest ocean and its\nresources. Papua New Guinea, in particular, is\nendowed with 5 to 7 per cent of the world\u2019s\nbiodiversity. We therefore share a common\nresponsibility to ensure the protection and conservation\nof those resources which are of vital importance to\nhumanity.\nWe encourage sustainable logging practices in\norder to avoid the denuding of our vast rainforest\nresources. We condemn destructive fishing methods\nand urge all Member States to adhere to sustainable\nmanagement and conservation regimes in order to meet\nfuture demands.\nAt the Pacific Islands Forum, our leaders recently\nadopted a new vision for the Pacific region in the form\nof the Pacific Plan, which embraces four key areas:\neconomic growth, sustainable development, security\nand good governance.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum will be engaging with\nthe European Union and other development partners to\nadvance the interests of the region, especially those of\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\nI share the view enunciated by other speakers that\nthere can be no security without development, and that\nequally, there can be no development without peace\nand security. As important links, both need to be\naddressed simultaneously if we want peace and\nsustainable development to prevail.\nWe are pleased to see regional solidarity and\nassistance in conflict situations bear good results in\nBougainville and in our neighbour, the Solomon\nIslands. We also note that other regional actions taken\nby our leaders, such as the establishment of the Pacific\nTransnational Crime Coordination Centre in Fiji,\nenhance law enforcement and intelligence sharing in\nthe region.\nConcerning good governance, our leaders\nencouraged Pacific Member Governments to sign and\n23\n\nratify the United Nations Convention against\nCorruption in accordance with the spirit of the\nBiketawa Declaration.\nOver the past several years, Papua New Guinea\nhas been the beneficiary of regional and international\nassistance in the rebuilding and return to normalcy of\nthe island of Bougainville, after a decade-long conflict.\nWe thank the members of the Security Council, both\npast and present, for their goodwill, patience and\nunderstanding in what has been an extremely painful\nexperience for us. We have appreciated the support and\ncounsel of each member of the Council throughout that\nimportant process. The conflict has greatly affected our\nnation and we have learned many lessons. We are re-\nestablishing the rule of law in a profound and thorough\nconstitutional process which will result in a\ndemocratically elected autonomous government for the\npeople of Bougainville. While we are close to\nachieving that, we are equally mindful that each step\ntaken now to finalize and consolidate the Bougainville\nconstitution is critically important for the autonomous\ngovernment of Bougainville to be sustained\nsuccessfully.\nWe continue to receive valuable support and\nassistance for the peace process from the Secretary-\nGeneral as well as from our Pacific neighbours:\nAustralia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and the\nSolomon Islands. Rebuilding and restoration of\nservices in Bougainville has been greatly assisted by\nour development partners, including the United\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, the European Union, Australia, New\nZealand and Japan, among others. We thank them all\nand look forward to their continued support and\ncooperation.\nWe continue to be concerned about the security\nand vulnerability of many of our small island States.\nAs noted and endorsed by Pacific leaders at the recent\nPacific Islands Forum Summit in Samoa, the\nforthcoming International Meeting on the 10-year\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action, to be\nheld in Mauritius in 2005, will provide an opportunity\nto discuss with our development partners the many\nissues which confront small island States, including\nthose in our subregion.\nDevelopment of women and children through\nsports must have a special place in our quest to\nimprove the socio-economic well-being of our people.\nWe are also working hard to implement the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and the outcomes of the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to have\ndevastating consequences in many developing\ncountries. Our leaders in the Pacific region have\nendorsed a regional strategy for HIV/AIDS noting the\nneed to address the issue urgently.\nSmall arms and light weapons will always\nthreaten the stability of many small States. Therefore,\nwe look forward to the continuing work towards a\nUnited-Nations-supported action plan for dealing with\nsmall arms.\nClimate change is a threat to all humankind and\ntherefore deserves the attention of the international\ncommunity, which must work together to address it.\nWe are appreciative of the position of the United\nKingdom as underlined by Prime Minister, The Right\nHonourable Tony Blair, in a recent statement\nhighlighting the threat of sea level rise and related\nissues. I am aware that there are scientific studies\nbeing carried out, but the real issue is that the effects of\nclimate change and global warming are being felt daily\nby many island States. We in Papua New Guinea are no\nmore immune to climate change and sea level rise than\nare many other small island States. The island\ncommunities in Papua New Guinea, like those of our\nneighbouring countries in the Pacific, are being\naffected adversely by sea level rise. We empathize with\nour colleagues from many other island States which\ncontinually suffer from the effects of the problem. Our\nplight is further compounded by natural disasters,\nincluding the ravages of hurricanes, cyclones,\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods and tsunamis.\nIn that context, our sympathies go to the peoples\nand the Governments of the Caribbean region,\nespecially those of Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, the\nBahamas and the Dominican Republic, among others,\nas well as to the inhabitants of cities and towns of the\nsouthern states of the United States of America, which\nhave been devastated by the recent hurricanes.\nAs a global community we must pool our\nresources and consider ways of mitigating the adverse\neffects of climate change in order to help those States\nwhich are vulnerable. We applaud the intention of the\nRussian Federation to consider becoming a party to the\nKyoto Protocol and urge others to recognize their\nresponsibility to the global community by doing the\nsame.\n24\n\nWe look forward to the final report of the High-\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\nappointed by the Secretary-General, which will form\nthe basis for high-level discussions on United Nations\nreforms, including the expansion and composition of\nthe Security Council. We believe Council membership\nshould be expanded in both the permanent and the non-\npermanent categories to take into account the lack of\nsufficient representation of developing countries in the\nAsia-Pacific, African and Latin American regions. We\nalso believe that Japan and Germany should be\nseriously considered for permanent membership, with\nequal privileges and obligations. Consideration may be\ngiven to other countries with appropriate qualifications\nand integrity, particularly from the developing world.\nWe also commend the indications from the Panel\nthat the definition of \u201chard\u201d versus \u201csoft\u201d threats is no\nlonger relevant. That will allow a proper and objective\ndiscussion to be held, given that the resonance of\nperceived threats can be viewed differently depending\non where the threat is.\nThat said, Papua New Guinea believes that\nreform of the United Nations system should be\ncomprehensive and that the General Assembly should\nregain its pre-eminent role as the principal organ of the\nUnited Nations. That will enable all Member States,\nlarge and small, to engage more meaningfully in\naddressing all challenges in an effective way in order\nto help the United Nations fulfil its role in the pursuit\nof a peaceful, just and prosperous world. That is the\npurpose for which the United Nations was established.\nAs we move towards next year\u2019s review of the\nMillennium Development Goals and the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, we should all look\nat the dire needs of the majority of humanity. My\ndelegation believes that the Millennium Development\nGoals provide the blueprint for achieving those\nobjectives.\nFinally, let me conclude by reaffirming Papua\nNew Guinea\u2019s support for the one-China policy, which\nprovides the sound basis for our bilateral relations with\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China."

        "file_text": "In\nthe middle of the nineteenth century railroads were\nbuilt all over the world. Steel at that time was not of\nsuch good quality and for that reason wheels\nsometimes broke, causing accidents and derailments.\nTo avoid those accidents, at every station stop there\nwas a brakeman who walked the length of the tracks,\nhammer in hand, hammering on the wheels so that any\nof the wheels that sounded broken could be changed.\nYears passed and the quality of steel improved, but the\nbrakemen kept hammering on the wheels, heedless of\nthe fact that it was no longer necessary.\nThe world changes, and that means that we, too,\nneed to change in order to adapt to new circumstances.\nSomething similar is happening in the United Nations.\nThe Security Council, designed after the Second World\nWar to maintain peace in the post-war world, is not the\nSecurity Council that the new century of information\ntechnology and globalization needs. We must reinvent\nthe United Nations.\n4\n\nLet us begin by making the reform of the United\nNations, on which we have already agreed, effective.\nWe have to broaden participation in the Security\nCouncil to include other countries, both as permanent\nmembers \u2014 which at the very least should include\nGermany and Japan \u2014 and as non-permanent\nmembers, in order to allow for more equitable and\ndemocratic representation.\nOur Organization needs to adapt to the new\nchallenges and realities of the present. Development,\nfor example, needs a new approach. What concerns us\nmost is to ensure that populations and individuals\nparticipate more actively in the decisions shaping their\nown future. As I said three days ago, in the \u201cAction\nAgainst Hunger and Poverty\u201d meeting of world\nleaders, development is a responsibility of States, but it\nis also the primary responsibility of the individual.\nI find the words of Nobel Laureate Jos\u00e9\nSaramago are appropriate here when he writes:\n\u201cAs vehemently as we claim our rights, let us\nalso lay claim to responsibility for our duties.\nPerhaps then the world will become a bit better.\u201d\nSo it was a wise thing that our American\nDeclaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, signed in\nBogot\u00e1 in 1948, established that equal to, and as a\ncounterpart to rights, there are also individual\nresponsibilities.\nThat includes instilling in the conscience of\ncitizens a culture of responsibility. Next to the right to\nreceive a State-sponsored education stands the civil\nresponsibility to make the most effective use of that\neducation and to obtain at least a primary education.\nNext to the right of children to have a father and a\nmother stands the duty of parents to care for, help,\nfeed, educate and shelter their young children.\nChildren, for their part, have the responsibility always\nto honour their parents, help them, feed them and give\nthem shelter when they are in need. Next to the right to\nemployment stands the duty to provide efficient\nservice. Everyone has the responsibility to work, each\naccording to his ability and possibilities, in order to\nobtain the resources for survival, thus achieving\npersonal progress and social development.\nAlong with the right to health goes the\nresponsibility to contribute to a healthy and clean\nenvironment. With the right to enjoy the benefits of\nprogress goes the responsibility to contribute to\ndevelopment. With the right to the freedom of\nexpression goes the responsibility of tolerating\ndiffering opinions. In short, every right has a\ncorresponding duty or responsibility.\nWith the fall of the Berlin wall, the age in which\nthe State was expected to be responsible for everything\ncame to a close. Today, we must all participate together\nin the search for new paths for our individual\ndevelopment and for that of our countries and of all\nhumanity.\nThe passing of time motivates us to renew our\nbasic principles. I therefore propose that we once again\nadopt an ethic of development based principally on\nindividual responsibility as well as on the\nresponsibility of nations.\nThe well-being and the development of nations\nare the result of individual well-being and the\ndevelopment of the people that make up that society.\nSocial well-being should not be measured by how\nmany people are assisted by social programmes\nfinanced from national budgets but by how many\npeople leave those programmes because they have\nbecome able to manage on their own.\nIn his book, Underdevelopment is a State of\nMind, Lawrence Harrison defines a negative attitude as\na barrier to development and a positive attitude \u2014\nbased on the belief in one\u2019s own ability to improve\noneself through individual effort \u2014 as a driving force\nof development.\nIn order to bolster all the elements I have cited, it\nis essential that the right to accede to public office\nshould be accompanied by the responsibility to carry\nout one\u2019s duties honestly. At the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly, several heads of State have\nemphasized the need to fight corruption. It is a\nresponsibility that has rightly been gaining ground.\nIn Nicaragua, we have undertaken the arduous\nfight against corruption. First, corrupt bureaucrats have\nbeen brought to trial and sentenced, just as is\nhappening in other Latin American countries.\nSecondly, we have brought before the National\nAssembly a body of legislation to strengthen our fight\nagainst corruption.\nThirdly, we have established a programme for\nintegrity and transparency that prevents corrupt\npractices in the executive branch and which provides a\nmodel for the other branches of Government in\n5\n\nundertaking reform and increasing transparency. For\nexample, we have published on the Internet, for\neveryone to see \u2014 for the countries extending\nassistance, international organizations and the\nmedia \u2014 both the Republic\u2019s national budget and the\ndetails of external assistance.\nFourthly, we have undertaken to fight the culture\nof corruption, including by teaching values and\npromoting the idea of the individual as the maker of his\nor her own destiny.\nWe must work for a United Nations that reaffirms\nits credibility and authority by taking the appropriate\neffective collective action. Nicaragua recognizes the\nimportance of the proposals various countries have\nsubmitted to this forum, in particular Spain\u2019s proposal\nto reduce external debt in exchange for initiatives for\nsocial development, particularly in the area of primary\neducation, and the United States proposal to create a\nfund for democracy. Nicaragua views with approval\nthat such a democracy fund would be partially\nallocated to training and support for auditing and\njudicial entities, given that corruption is the greatest\nfoe of democracy. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nsaid yesterday, \u201cThey notice when we use words to\nmask inaction\u201d. Nicaragua\u2019s energy and determination\nare devoted to those efforts.\nRecent world events have demonstrated once\nagain the evil nature of terrorism and how it breaks\ndown the values of humanity and civilization. I\nreiterate my most sincere condolences to all those\ncountries and individuals around the world that have\nsuffered the effects of terrorism.\nI underline that we deplore, to cite only the most\nrecent acts, those who caused the loss of the precious\nlives of innocent children in the Russian Federation.\nWe also repudiate the attack against the Australian\nEmbassy in Jakarta.\nThe best way to defeat terrorism is to remain\nfaithful to our values of freedom, dignity and justice.\nTerrorism rejects those values.\nNicaragua aspires to be elected as a non-\npermanent member of the Security Council for 2006\nand 2007. Nicaragua, a founding country of the\nOrganization, has known and suffered the horrors of\nwar and has undertaken the democratization of our\nnation. It is by virtue of the valuable school of our\nrecent history that we can participate in the Security\nCouncil. As I stated in this forum last year, whoever\nknows the horrors of war can contribute more\neffectively to preventing it.\nI cannot fail to refer to the question of Taiwan\u2019s\nrepresentation in the United Nations. That country,\nwith 23 million inhabitants, has a democratic\nGovernment and maintains diplomatic, trade and\ncooperative relations with many Member States of the\nOrganization. However, paradoxically, it lacks\nmembership. That exclusion is inexcusable.\nAt the beginning of this session, we heard the sad\nmessages from Haiti and the Dominican Republic,\nwhich have suffered the devastating effects of nature. I\nconvey our solidarity, encouragement and hope to\nthose countries and to the victims of natural disasters\nin the United States, Grenada, Jamaica, Panama, the\nBahamas, Cuba, Grand Cayman and other islands of\nthe Caribbean.\nThis afternoon, I began my address by speaking\nof the responsibilities of citizens. That is the way for\nour peoples to attain their hopes, expectations and\ndreams.\nMay God bless the United Nations and may God\nalways bless Nicaragua."

        "file_text": "Let me begin\nby congratulating you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. I am convinced that your work in that\nimportant post will ensure further progress towards the\nattainment of our common goals. I wish you the\ngreatest of success and pledge the full support of our\ndelegation. I should also like to take this opportunity to\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Saint Lucia, for his excellent work\nand, above all, for his personal contribution to the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\nThis is the first time that the Slovak Republic has\nparticipated in the general debate of the General\nAssembly as a member of the European Union (EU).\nSlovakia fully endorses the position set out earlier by\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the\nNetherlands on behalf of the EU. I am convinced that\nthe enlarged EU will further strengthen its constructive\npartnership with the United Nations.\nThe international community is now facing\nchallenges and threats that were unknown when the\nCharter of the United Nations was drafted. The\nmultilateral mechanisms set out in the previous century\nhave proved to be less than adequate. Recent global\nevents \u00f3 accompanied by an increase in new and\npotentially more dangerous and destructive threats -\nhave clearly demonstrated that no country can cope\nwith security issues single-handedly, let alone tackle\nthem over the long term. There is now a greater need\nthan ever before for international solidarity, together\nwith a sense of responsibility on the part of all United\n17\n\nNations Member States for consolidating peace and\nstability.\nThe Slovak Republic is convinced that a\nmultilateral approach is the best response to emerging\nthreats, and that the role of the United Nations in\nmaintaining global security is irreplaceable. In\naddition, we agree with the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, that the United Nations can maintain\nsuch a status only if it is able to carry out its basic\nfunctions effectively, embark upon internal reform and\nadapt to current conditions. To that end, the only way\nforward involves strengthening the authority of United\nNations institutions by making their work and\ndecision-making mechanisms more efficient. That is\nwhy we have welcomed the establishment of the High-\nLevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Its\nwork will undoubtedly rank among the most important\ncontributions made towards reform in the history of the\nUnited Nations. We believe that that team of eminent\npersonalities will provide a realistic definition of how\nthe United Nations can contribute to global security\nand development. Slovakia will help to turn those\nobjectives into reality.\nWe perceive the issue of reforming the Security\nCouncil in the same light. Reform should involve not\nonly enlarging the Security Council, but also making\nits working methods and the implementation of its\ndecisions more efficient. The Slovak Republic\ncontinues to support the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil with both permanent and non-permanent\nmembers, with the aim of ensuring a balanced regional\ndistribution of seats, including greater representation\nfor the Eastern European region.\nIn addition, I am confident that this session of the\nGeneral Assembly will help to build a global security\nsystem by strengthening and consolidating the anti-\nterrorism coalition under the auspices of the United\nNations, along with the Counter-Terrorism Committee\nof the Security Council.\nContinuing terrorist attacks are leading to\nsignificant changes in the area of global security.\nTerrorists do not shy away from perpetrating the\ncruellest and most bestial of acts; nor \u00f3 as the recent\nevents in Beslan have shown \u00f3 do they hesitate to take\nthe lives of innocent children. Terrorism poses a threat\nto everyone; no one can be neutral or indifferent. It is\nnecessary that we be resolute and jointly mobilize our\nefforts in combating it.\nThe Governments of Member States must fight\nmore effectively against this inhuman phenomenon\nthrough mutual support, the implementation of\ninternational law and improved cooperation between\ninternational and regional organizations. The 12 United\nNations anti-terrorism conventions and protocols are of\nthe utmost importance in the fight against terrorism,\nand the Organization must continue to play a key role\nin bolstering legal instruments in that battle. The\nSlovak Republic supports the prompt approval of a\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism as a\nwhole, along with a convention aimed at averting acts\nof nuclear terrorism.\nMaintaining international peace and security has\nalways been one of the Slovakia\u00eds main priorities. We\nhave long contributed military units, observers and\nequipment to United Nations peacekeeping missions.\nSince our accession to the United Nations, in January\n1993, we have participated in 14 Organization-led\nmissions, ranging from military observer missions to\nhumanitarian and demining operations to peacekeeping\nduties.\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, the Slovak\nRepublic has dedicated itself both militarily and\npolitically to the peace process in the Balkans.\nNonetheless, Slovakia has never abandoned its efforts\nto help bring reconciliation and humanitarian aid to\nother parts of the world. We have gained respect for\nour participation in United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions in Africa and the Middle East.\nSlovakia also contributes to the training of\npeacekeeping forces. In line with General Assembly\nresolutions, the Slovak Government sponsored a\nUnited Nations seminar held in the Slovak Republic\nlast May, which was attended by a wide range of\ndelegates from more than 70 Member States. The\nseminar discussed the conclusions of the Brahimi\nreport (A/55/305), which highlighted the importance of\nstandardized training for United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions.\nIn recent years, the number of attacks on United\nNations personnel has increased alarmingly. Slovakia\nis a signatory to the Convention on the Safety of\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel and appeals\nto all those countries that have not yet done so to\nendorse that important international legal instrument,\n18\n\nwhich guarantees the protection of United Nations\nstaff.\nStabilizing the Western Balkans is a global\npriority and has a direct effect on the stability of\nEurope. For that reason, it is also one of Slovakia\u00eds\nforeign policy priorities. We have fully supported the\nactivities of the United Nations to date in using its\nauthority effectively to help resolve the conflicts in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in the Serbian-Montenegrin\nprovince of Kosovo and in the former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia. Slovakia\u00eds proactive approach\nin that regard was demonstrated by the political stance\nit adopted towards the resolution of those conflicts, as\nwell as its participation in peacekeeping missions: the\nStabilization Force for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\nKosovo Force for the Province of Kosovo.\nWe believe that resolving the situation in the\nprovince of Kosovo is a prerequisite for the\nstabilization of the Western Balkans as a whole.\nKosovo still represents a potential source of regional\ninstability. That is why we attach great importance to\nnext year\u00eds evaluation to be carried out as part of the\nKosovo Standards Implementation Plan. A favourable\nresult in that evaluation could launch a process under\nwhich the future status of the Serbian-Montenegrin\nprovince would be defined by the United Nations. We\nperceive the United Nations activities, including the\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\nKosovo, as being of great importance in the search for\na solution that is acceptable to all parties concerned, in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999).\nThe Slovak Republic welcomed the transfer of\npower to a temporary, sovereign and independent\nGovernment in Iraq at the end of June. The Interim\nCouncil, which was recently established by the\nNational Conference, represents a significant step\nforward in preparing for the elections to be held in\nJanuary 2005.\nI call upon the Assembly to join us in our\nabsolute condemnation of all acts of violence\ncommitted in Iraq aimed at spreading chaos and\ninstability, whether by means of assassinations, the\ntaking of hostages or the intimidation of civilians and\npublic figures.\nWe welcome the determination of the Secretary-\nGeneral to continue providing humanitarian aid and\nsupport for the political process in Iraq. We believe\nthat the United Nations must play a leading role in\nsupporting the Iraqi people and the Government in\ntheir efforts to rebuild their society.\nImproving the security situation in Iraq is an\nessential condition for building long-term stability,\ndemocracy, peace and prosperity in the country. A\nSlovak unit specialized in locating and destroying\nlandmines, weapons and ammunition is currently\nengaged in a humanitarian mission there. In addition,\nSlovakia has stepped up its participation by joining a\nprogramme for training Iraqi police officers.\nThe Slovak Republic supports and appreciates the\nefforts of the international community to establish\nsecurity and stability in Afghanistan. The International\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF) is playing a vital\nrole, demonstrating how essential international\ncooperation can be. The most pressing issues we\ncurrently face with regard to creating stability in\nAfghanistan are, first, the forthcoming elections and,\nsecondly, laying down the foundations of democracy.\nIn addition to those political processes, establishing\nfavourable conditions for economic development is\nalso essential for Afghanistan\u00eds long-term stability. The\nSlovak Republic is contributing to such efforts through\nits participation in ISAF and its planned involvement\nin provincial reconstruction teams.\nThe Middle East peace process must continue in\naccordance with the road map set out by the Quartet\nand endorsed by the Security Council, which envisages\nthe establishment of two separate Israeli and\nPalestinian States in 2005. Both sides should fulfil\ntheir obligations stemming from that plan and previous\nUnited Nations resolutions. They should also rely upon\nthe international Quartet for help and good counsel\nwhen taking those steps.\nAs we are convinced that international peace,\nsecurity and development are closely linked, official\ndevelopment assistance and cooperation with\ndeveloping and transition countries are becoming an\nintegral part of Slovakia\u00eds foreign policy. Slovakia\u00eds\nEuropean Union membership and its growing\neconomic potential provide both an opportunity and the\nobligation to cooperate in the field of development.\nThis year, the Slovak Government has allocated $25\nmillion for development assistance. In 2005, that figure\nis set to rise to almost $30 million. As a new donor\ncountry, Slovakia must work to further improve and\nformalize its mechanisms for providing official\n19\n\ndevelopment assistance. It is doing so with the support\nof the European Commission and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme.\nSevere humanitarian crises also pose a threat to\npeace and security in the modern world. Such crises are\nnot necessarily the result of armed conflicts alone, but\nthey sometimes have the potential to cause such\nconflicts. The international community has the means\nto intervene in humanitarian crises. With respect to the\ncurrent humanitarian and security crisis in the\nSudanese region of Darfur, I am convinced that the\ninternational community, in cooperation with the\nSudanese Government, will find a solution to the\nsituation through economic and financial assistance.\nThe Slovak Republic has provided humanitarian aid to\nthat region and supports the continuation of peaceful\nnegotiations towards resolving the humanitarian and\nsecurity crisis there.\nThe Slovak Republic is fully aware of the\nenormity of the tasks facing the United Nations in the\nfield of ensuring global peace and security. In that\nregard, I would like to highlight that Slovakia is a\ncandidate for a seat as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council for the term 2006-2007 in the\nelections to be held at the next session of the General\nAssembly, in the fall of 2005. I can assure the\nAssembly that in every respect, the Slovak Republic is\nready to take on the responsibilities arising from\nmembership in that key organ of the United Nations.\nAs my country\u00eds Head of State, I feel it is important to\nmake this personal pledge before the highly esteemed\nsession of the General Assembly. We want to use our\nmembership of the Security Council to intensify\ncooperation with Member States in all regions and to\nbe a dependable partner when seeking consensus in the\nresolution of complicated global policy issues.\nIn conclusion, allow me to wish this year\u00eds\nsession of the General Assembly the greatest of\nsuccess. May it reach conclusions that promote\ncooperation among Member States, international and\nregional organizations, and non-governmental\norganizations and associations \u00f3 based, above all,\nupon the principle of multilateralism."

The Government\nof Georgia reaffirms its strong support for the\nimportant work carried out around the world by this\ngreat institution and to all who serve it.\nThe beginning of the new millennium marks a\ngreat opportunity for the global community of nations\nthat make up the United Nations - a community\nwhose collective responsibility is to help strengthen\nthose institutions that promote and protect the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations, so that we can more effectively tackle the\nchallenges and the issues facing the world today and so\nthat together we can enhance our shared ability to\npromote peace, alleviate suffering, expand liberty and\nadvance human development with renewed wisdom\nand courage.\nThe belief that we must be able to adapt to great\nchange while remaining faithful to a set of core ideas\nand values is one that has special resonance in Georgia\ntoday, for few countries have witnessed greater\ntransformation in the past year \u00f3 and fewer still have\ndone so with a clearer sense of purpose. In some\nrespects, Georgia's revolution has made our small\nnation - willingly or unwillingly - a test case for the\nmodern challenges of democratic transition and\nperhaps for a revised formula for international relations\nin our increasingly interconnected and complex world.\nNearly a year has passed since our dramatic Rose\nRevolution graced the cover of newspapers and\ntelevision broadcasts around the world. This revolution\nhad at its core one simple demand: the creation of a\nstable, equitable and functional democracy. It gives me\ngreat pride, Mr. President, to inform you that we have\naccomplished that demand in ways that few abroad or\nat home ever imagined possible. And I am enormously\nproud of my people, whose courage, unity and\nsteadfast belief in a better future made our revolution\nand transformation possible. It is because of the\nGeorgian people that our experiment in democracy is a\n12\n\nsuccess, and because of their sacrifice and\ndetermination that we have achieved such impressive\nresults today.\nIn less than a year, we have proven the depth and\nbreadth of our commitment to democracy successfully\nby holding three sets of elections - presidential,\nparliamentary and regional - which were recognized\nby all observers as free and fair expressions of the\npublic will.\nWe have proven that we can take care of people\nsuch as the teachers of my country, who just a few days\nago received as much as 12 years in back pay from our\nGovernment. I was recently told by a local governor of\nhow one such teacher - who had not been paid since\nour independence - had just received her payment for\nall of those years. For all of those years, that brave\nwoman, who sacrificed her health and her livelihood\nfor the education of younger generations while\nsurviving on the meagre income from a small plot of\nland, watched as our corrupt officials - at her expense\nand that of her compatriots - were creating their own\nwealth, constructing huge mansions and filling their\nSwiss bank accounts. Finally she got her money back.\nShe also watched the corrupt officials chased away\nfrom power and held accountable under our legislation.\nNever again will loyal public servants have to\nharvest food from their gardens to make ends meet.\nNever again will they have to face a Government that\ndisrespects their dignity. Protecting people like that\nteacher is the reason why we have confronted\ncorruption in Georgia so vigorously, since corruption\nthreatened the very fabric of our society. By first going\nafter government officials who were corrupt and who\nenjoyed a near-untouchable status, and then seeking to\naddress the institutional aspects - the corruption that\nbasically gave rise to such government officials - we\nhave been able to reinstate the rule of law and create\nlasting change in the system.\nThat is why we conducted a radical downsizing\nof our security services, police and customs by up to 50\nper cent. Instead of poorly paid government\nofficials - civil servants who were not given any real\nsalaries and who were compelled to extort money from\ntheir fellow citizens - we have now introduced new\nsalaries that are sometimes 8 to 10 times greater than\nthose paid previously, as well as new rules of the game.\nWe have introduced new salaries that are\nsometimes eight to 10 times larger than those paid\npreviously, as well as new rules of the game. We have\nintroduced the first-ever civilian leadership in defence,\nsecurity and law-enforcement bodies. We have made\nthese painful choices because we know that, unless we\nchange the system itself, we cannot change the corrupt\nbehaviour of our State officials. It is those officials\nwho are responsible for the corrupt behaviour of\nbusinesses \u00f3 not the businessmen themselves.\nIt is we who are responsible for failing to build a\nbetter future for our citizens. Winning this battle will\nmean that all citizens of my country will finally have a\nchance to live in a normal State - where merit rather\nthan money makes a difference, and where rules and\nlaws firmly and clearly govern people's actions.\nAs I said earlier, in order to make such changes\npermanent and sustainable, we have raised salaries six,\neight or even tenfold for public servants, so that\nincentives are aligned, a fair system can flourish and\npeople can serve the State with dignity and honour.\nThat is why we have created a new tax system\nthat clarifies and simplifies both the payment and the\nadministration of taxes - creating the lowest-tax\nregime and the least complicated tax code in the\nregion, and eliminating institutional sources of\ncheating and corruption.\nTo hesitate or move cautiously at this critical\nstage would mean reneging on the promises we have\nmade and returning to business as usual in this part of\nthe world. Our people will not forgive any hesitation.\nI believe that we cannot refrain from initiating\nreforms and taking radical steps at this time if we truly\nwant to build a better future and forever change the\nrules of the game.\nBut Georgia today is a visibly different State than\nit was one year ago, with fewer games and new rules.\nThat is why those who fled Georgia throughout the past\ndecade - one of decay and crisis - are now starting\nto return to their homeland. They are putting their\nskills, talents, ideas and energy to work for their new\ncountry. There is a great deal of new energy and a new\noptimism, which we are happy to observe.\nThere is a renewed sense of hope and a renewed\nsense of purpose that speaks of unity and the unique\nstrength that comes with it. Georgia's experiment in\ndemocracy is an ongoing success, not simply because I\ndeclare it or wish it, but, rather, because the people of\nGeorgia continue to embrace it. We are a nation that\n13\n\nhas a strong cultural heritage and identity, but that at\nthe same time celebrates and cherishes religious and\nethnic tolerance and religious freedom as part of that\nidentity and that heritage. We are a nation that believes\nin the sanctity of rule of law and a strong judicial\nsystem.\nOne thing is clear: democracy is thriving in our\npart of the world although many people thought it\nwould not be possible. That is because the principles of\ndemocratic governance are reflected in our national\nidentity and universal desire to be free.\nThe creation of a successful State depends on the\nability of its institutions to act maturely and\nresponsibly in the face of shared challenges. In this\nnew millennium, it is clear to all responsible nations\nthat one issue above all others unites us as we seek to\npromote lasting peace, security and prosperity: the\ncommon war on terrorism.\nAs a member of the global coalition that seeks to\neliminate the threat of terrorism, Georgia has made,\nand will continue to make, contributions wherever\npossible and wherever necessary. Our willingness to\nact responsibly and to contribute is evident today in\nKosovo and in Iraq - and soon will be in\nAfghanistan - all places to which we have sent our\nforces to serve alongside others in the pursuit of peace\nand freedom. For terrorism knows no greater enemy\nand no greater force than the one embodied in a free\nsociety.\nToday I am proud to announce Georgia's newest\ncontribution to freedom: our offer to send fresh troops\nto Iraq to serve in the special protection force for the\nUnited Nations Mission in Iraq. In offering our\nservices to the United Nations Mission, we are hopeful\nthat our presence will foster lasting stability, prosperity\nand freedom for the Iraqi people \u00f3 freedom worthy of\nall those who live in the region at large.\nIn the context of our cooperation with\ninternational anti-terrorist efforts, we especially value\nthe work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the\nSecurity Council, and we support the idea of\nstrengthening the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\nSecretariat.\nAt this point, however, one could reasonably ask\nwhy such a small country - one of fewer than\n5 million people - is so out in front in its international\ncommitments to fighting terrorism and in contributing\nto that global cause. The answer is as painful as it is\nsimple. Simply put, Georgia's commitments to fighting\nterrorism reflect our deep understanding of the\ndestruction that it can and has wrought in our own\ncountry and in our immediate neighbourhood. Georgia\nunderstands that we must do all we can to defeat\nterrorism.\nUnfortunately, Georgia today is still dealing with\nthe results of unresolved separatist conflicts in two\nparts of our country \u00f3 Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\nThose conflicts have resulted in loss of life, the\ndestruction of property, and the forced exodus and\nethnic cleansing of 300,000 Georgians, thus creating a\nlarge population of internally displaced persons. Those\nconflicts cannot remain unresolved; we as a country\nwill never get used to the loss of control over that part\nof the territory or to the plight of those who have been\ndeprived of their livelihoods and their basic human\nrights.\nGeorgia's new democracy is committed to\nresolving these conflicts, because no democracy can\nallow black holes to exist on its territory. Indeed, their\nexistence is fundamentally incompatible with progress,\ndevelopment and lasting stability. No democracy can\ntolerate them on its territory.\nToday, we are living in an era where the civilized\nnations of the world are united in a global war on\nterrorism, and, in that world, neither Georgia nor the\nrest of the international community can afford to look\nthe other way. Uncontrolled zones breed crime, drug\ntrafficking, arms trading and, most notably, terrorism.\nThe threats posed by violent separatism affect the\nsecurity not only of Georgia but of the entire Caucasus.\nIn places like Abkhazia, on the shores of the Black\nSea, these lawless zones have the potential to affect\nEuropean security as long as the situation there\nremains unresolved.\nThe lawless territories of Abkhazia and South\nOssetia are safe havens for mini-dictatorships, tightly\ncontrolled by elite groups that seek to profit from the\ncriminal status quo. It causes me pain to say that, in\nthese extremely closed societies \u00f3 by and large cut off\nfrom the rest of the world \u00f3 children grow up with\nguns in their hands instead of books. Their heads are\nfilled with hatred and intolerance, instead of respect for\ndifference and appreciation for cultural diversity.\n14\n\nWe must put an end to this cycle of destruction.\nWe must do more to eliminate the threats to peace and\nsecurity that have for too long retarded our\ndevelopment.\nAs we seek to find lasting solutions to these\n\u00ecfrozen\u00ee conflicts, once again Georgia can be\nconsidered a test case. Our success in that respect\nwould be your success, too. Here, I want to state in the\nclearest of terms that Georgia is fully committed to\nsolving these conflicts through solely peaceful means.\nGeorgia will not and cannot use violence to solve these\nconflicts, because no democracy can go to war against\nits own people.\nWhat all parts of Georgia need today is\ndevelopment, investment, security and lasting\neconomic growth. We will peacefully reincorporate\nSouth Ossetia and Abkhazia, so that all citizens of\nGeorgia can share in the fruits of our success.\nI believe that the most effective mechanism for\nestablishing Georgia\u00eds unity is the creation of a strong\neconomy, where those who are not yet sure if they want\nto remain outside Georgia will be given real incentives\nand chances to benefit from a prosperous, tolerant and\nsuccessful State \u00f3 a place where they and their\nchildren will be able to find jobs, earn stable incomes,\nand have access to new opportunities and investments.\nIn a strengthened economy, all of Georgia's\ninhabitants will know that they live in a State that is\nable to care for and look after them \u00f3 in sickness and\nin health. These are the qualities that an economically\nstrong and democratically vibrant Georgia will\nguarantee all its citizens. We must do everything\npossible to realize that vision if we want to build a\nunited future. As Georgia looks to the future, it does so\nwith a clear and understandable plan. Today, I would\nlike to introduce the idea of a new stage-by-stage\nsettlement plan, designed to speed the resolution of\nthese conflicts.\nStep one is to initiate confidence-building\nmeasures, so that new forms of trust are established\nthat create lasting human bonds between peoples.\nThose measures could include exchanges and links\nbetween various non-governmental organizations \u00f3\nyouth group to youth group, student to student,\njournalist to journalist, athlete to athlete, health-care\nworker to health-care worker, mother to mother \u00f3 so\nthat more citizens and more segments of our society\ncan learn to understand one another and to trust one\nanother.\nBuilding confidence means pursuing joint\neconomic projects that create wealth where today there\nis want and create profits where today there is poverty.\nBuilding confidence means restoring and guaranteeing\nthe right of internally displaced persons to return to\ntheir native homes.\nWe can and must build confidence between\npeoples, as the first precondition for peace. We can and\nmust do more to protect human rights through\ninternational police forces in places like Gali and\nthrough the existing Human Rights Office of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nlocated in Gali.\nTogether, we could move on to step two, which\nwould focus on specific measures aimed at achieving\ndemilitarization and a truly international format for a\npeacekeeping operation in our area, transforming the\ncurrent peacekeeping operation into a broad\ninternational operation, so that the people of those\nregions can live free from fear of uncontrolled militias,\nirregulars and violent gangs, which hold us all hostage\nto the status quo.\nThose steps will require monitoring, verification\nand transparency, so that we can achieve the necessary\nresults.\nThe third stage, step three, envisions a global\nsolution with global guarantees that would lead to the\nestablishment of the fullest and broadest form of\nautonomy \u00f3 one that protects culture and language\nand guarantees self-governance, fiscal control and\nmeaningful representation and power-sharing at the\nnational government level. Most important, it would\nlead to an autonomy that empowers average people, so\nthat isolated elites no longer act as the sole decision\nmakers over people\u00eds future.\nGeorgia greatly appreciates the support rendered\nby the Group of Friends and the Geneva process, as\nwell as the concepts and principles contained within\nthe Boden document, which should be transmitted to\nthe Abkhaz side.\nNow is the time to enhance those commitments;\nnow is the time for the international community to do\nmuch more. Simply put: the international community\ncan no longer afford to look the other way when gross\nviolations of human rights take place in separatist\n15\n\nenclaves, just as they can no longer afford to ignore the\nsecurity risks that emanate from those black holes and\nsmugglers\u00ed safe havens.\nThe relevance of that point was brought to the\nattention of the world after terrorists seized a school of\ninnocent children in Beslan, surprising and shocking\nthe world with their brutality. The people of Georgia\nwere deeply shocked, and we of course condemn that\nbrutal act and express deep sympathy to the families of\nthe victims of that terrible tragedy, which sent\nshockwaves through every Georgian household.\nAs we know, the terrorists that seized the school\nare common enemies of Russia and Georgia alike. We\nhad seen such individuals \u00f3 notorious for their acts of\ndestruction, violence and killing \u00f3 when they\nunleashed the same kind of bloodshed in the name of\nAbkhaz separatism 10 or 11 years ago. Those terrible\nevents prove once again that we cannot afford to ignore\nthe dangerous linkages that exist between the\nseparatism on one side of the Caucasus mountains and\nthe violence on the other side.\nAll separatists sow the seeds of great instability,\nand lawless zones can be sanctuaries for criminals who\nconduct acts of terror. It is our moral obligation to put\nan end to the unilateral practice of reaching out to\nseparatists without the consent or knowledge of the\nauthorities of the central Government in Tbilisi. In\norder to defeat that evil, we must not allow double\nstandards to persist. I believe that we can work\ntogether with other countries in that respect.\nThe time has come for Georgia and Russia to\nenter a new stage of cooperation whose goal is to\ndefeat that common enemy. It is our moral obligation\nand profound responsibility to join forces more\nrobustly in that cause.\nI firmly agree with President Putin that we can\nnever negotiate with terrorists or cut deals with killers.\nBut we may - and we should - work with moderate\nelements who seek peace without violence.\nWe must reach out to every segment of society.\nWe must do away forever with the Basayevs of the\nworld, no matter what side of the border they terrorize,\nand reach out to ordinary, peace-loving people. All\nforms of violent separatism - whether in Tskhinvali,\nGrozny or Sukhumi - represent destabilizing factors\nfor Russia and Georgia alike.\nI am confident that, by working together more\nrobustly, we can make great progress in reducing that\nshared risk. I believe that there are a number of\nconcrete initiatives on which we can embark today that\nwill bring immediate results - initiatives that again\nconfirm Georgia's status as a test case for the\npromotion of a foreign policy that leads us away from\nthe outdated politics of domination, advancing, instead,\nour shared interest and the great potential for regional\ncooperation.\nThat means finally coming to grips with the need\nto close outdated Russian military bases, left over from\nthe past and from a country that no longer exists.\nLet me be clear: while we appreciate any help in\nstrengthening our security structures so as to make us a\nmore responsible contributor to international peace and\nsecurity, Georgia is firm in its position that we will not\nhave any new foreign military bases on our territory.\nToday, Georgia needs bridges, not bases; roads,\nnot rockets. And we need cooperation, not competition,\nwhen it comes to eliminating sources of instability and\nterror.\nThe mechanics of the new relationship with\nRussia means pooling our resources and efforts to\ncreate a joint anti-terrorism centre to counter common\nthreats. It means expanding joint border patrols to the\nentire Russian-Georgian border, so that no area is left\nexposed. Thus the era of zero-sum thinking can be\nreplaced with policies that lead to a win-win situation.\nThat is my fundamental conviction.\nThose efforts will require greater sharing of\ninformation and intelligence, and a greater degree of\ntrust \u00f3 all of which Georgia stands ready to provide.\nWhy? Because such actions serve the cause of peace;\nbecause they are part of what it means to remain a\nresponsible member of the international community of\nnations; and, finally, because we have no reasonable\nalternative: failure is not an option.\nIn order to replace the mistrust and\nmisperceptions that sometimes derail our progress,\nGeorgia today proposes the establishment of new\nbilateral bodies to deal with issues between us and\nRussia, in which bilateral issues and misgivings could\nbe regularly discussed and considered. We should\nbegin considering the establishment of such a body so\nthat our relations never again suffer from\nmisunderstanding or misinterpretation.\n16\n\nWe should, together, consider issues such as the\nprotection of the rights of Russian citizens now living\nin Georgia so that no inhabitant of Georgia ever feels\nforgotten or unprotected. At the same time, of course,\nsuch relations would be based on the principles of\ninternational law and mutual respect for each other\u00eds\nindependence.\nAll this and more is necessary because there is\nnothing more important than serving the cause of\npeace. And I am confident and optimistic that my\ncolleague, President Putin, desires the very same for\nhis people. I believe that Georgia will remain a test\ncase in our part of the world in the near future as we\nbuild democracy and further advance cooperation.\nCooperation among the United States, the\nEuropean Union, Russia and the countries of the\nCaucasus must become the litmus test for this new\nrelationship. Whether it is the fight against terrorism or\nthe development of energy or of transit and trade lines,\nthe region must become a model of cooperation and\nstability that benefits everybody.\nWe are firmly on the path towards integrating into\nregional security structures that serve the stability and\nsecurity of everybody in the region. Georgia is\nbecoming an increasingly functional, performing State,\nafter being a failed State just one year ago. We now\nhave a budget that is three times bigger than it used to\nbe. Our structures are much more efficient than they\nused to be. Our people are more optimistic than they\nused to be. We could be a major part of those\nstructures, and we offer ourselves as a responsible\nmember of the local and international communities. I\nam sure that, by following that path, we can unlock the\ngreat potential of this crucial and great region for\npeace, prosperity and stability - a task I look forward\nto pursuing with all of Georgia's friends and\nneighbours."

        "file_text": "It\nis my great honour to represent the Salvadoran people\nas I address the United Nations, the supreme global\nforum, for the first time.\nI wish to convey my sincerest congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your election to coordinate the work of this\nsession. We also thank Mr. Julian Hunte for his\noutstanding leadership of the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nTo the Secretary-General, we reiterate our\nadmiration and our respect for his leadership in the\nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter at a time when the Organization is\nconfronting growing and complex global challenges\naffecting international peace and security.\nInternal and international conflicts, terrorism and\ntransnational organized crime, the persistence of\nextreme poverty, environmental deterioration and\nunresolved development problems are global in nature\nand require a harmonizing centre that can support the\nefforts of the international community to find shared\nand consensual solutions in order to establish an\ninternational order that responds to the needs and\naspirations of humankind.\nThat integrating centre must be the United\nNations. We therefore support the establishment of the\npanel of eminent persons to make recommendations on\ncollective security and the strengthening of\nmultilateralism in order more effectively to confront\nglobal challenges.\nIrrational and criminal terrorist acts have\nhighlighted the need for us to unite in our efforts and\nour determination, regardless of the differences that\nmay exist among States, to unify our views and adopt\ncollective action to find ways to confront the\nphenomenon and its causes, in the framework of\nrespect for international law.\nThe delegation of El Salvador reaffirms its full\nconviction that global terrorism is not an issue between\ncultures or nations. From that perspective, the\nGovernment of El Salvador has decided to respond to\nthe United Nations appeal by participating in the work\nof reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in Iraq.\nBy its very nature, our presence in Iraq deserves\nan additional explanation. We are not there for military\nreasons. Ours is a considered response to the appeal\nlaunched by this Organization for the international\ncommunity to help in the transition phase leading to\nthe full establishment of authority based on the free\nwill of the Iraqi people, with absolute respect for its\nterritorial integrity, its own culture and its\nunquestionable right to define its own destiny.\nEl Salvador suffered a long internal war and\nsucceeded, with the support of the international\ncommunity and the United Nations, in achieving\nlasting peace. We believe that the time has come to\nmake our testimony and accumulated experience, both\nduring the political negotiations for peace and the\npeace-building phase, available to other peoples.\nEl Salvador reiterates its firm and resolute\nsupport for peace-building and peacekeeping\noperations, above all because we have enjoyed the\nbenefits of such an operation, but also, of course,\nbecause of their positive results in various regions of\n14\n\nthe world. On the basis of that conviction, our country\nhas signed a memorandum of understanding with the\nUnited Nations, the best evidence of El Salvador\u2019s\ncommitment to such activities, which are so necessary\nin today\u2019s complex and unquiet world. We have\npresented a list of resources that are available to the\nworld Organization as a basis for our participation in\nfuture operations, in addition to those in which we are\nalready participating.\nIn that context, in order to demonstrate our spirit\nof cooperation on these issues, I am pleased to\nannounce my Government\u2019s interest in submitting its\ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil so as to make our accumulated experience\navailable to this Organization.\nSince the successful conclusion of our internal\nconflict, El Salvador has focused its attention\nresolutely on human development. The Government I\nlead, by dint of a broad majority vote of the Salvadoran\npeople on 1 June, is one of openness and inclusion,\nwith a vision of national integration and service to the\ninterests and aspirations of our people. Such vital\nquestions as security, employment, the effective\nimprovement of basic services and the productivity of\nour communities and regions are the top priorities of\nour governing programme.\nWe are focusing on transforming national\neducation, on reshaping public health care, on\nsignificantly strengthening the rule of law, on\ncombating crime in all its manifestations and at all\nlevels, on reactivating the economy and on making\nSalvadoran society internationally competitive. Insofar\nas we achieve greater progress domestically, we will be\ncompetitive externally.\nIn addition, however, we are working on a social\nplan geared towards reducing extreme poverty in the\nnext five years. To that end, we are undertaking a tax\nreform that will increase tax collection and reduce\nevasion, allowing us to obtain the additional funds\nnecessary to implementing our social plan. We shall\nlevy a special tax on tobacco, alcohol, weapons and\nammunition in order to promote a special health care\nfund with which we will expand health assistance to\nthe rural areas of our country and undermine the black\nmarket in those goods.\nIn the approximately 100 days that we have been\nin office, we have undertaken important health reforms\nby extending medical coverage to the age of 12 for the\nchildren of workers who contribute to Salvadoran\nsocial security and by granting emergency paediatric\nservices to almost 400,000 boys and girls.\nWe know that no Government effort will be\neffective without the cooperation of all sectors in our\ncountry. We are therefore launching a mechanism of\nunderstanding with all our political and social forces.\nIn that context, we have established an employment\nagreement that seeks solutions, together with private\nenterprise, for strengthening the agriculture,\nconstruction, tourism and micro-, small and medium-\nsized business sectors, with the aim of generating more\njobs.\nOne of the best mechanisms for increasing our\ndevelopment potential is investment in education. In\nthat awareness, we have launched the National\nEducation Plan 2021, which seeks to reinvigorate our\nvision of the future of education through short-,\nmedium- and long-term programmes. We hope that our\nnational effort will also enjoy international\ncooperation. That is why we were pleased by the\ndecision taken by the Government of Spain to provide\nassistance for primary education.\nThe most urgent of the challenges confronting\nSalvadoran society is that of providing security to our\ncitizens. In order to meet that need, we recently\nestablished a rural police force, along with a\nuncompromising plan to eradicate delinquency in\nurban areas overrun by gangs. The plan also offers\nspecial programmes for young people who wish to\nabandon the path of crime.\nEl Salvador unreservedly shares the interests\nexpressed at the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development. We reiterate our dedication to\nseeking alternative ways and means and renewed\ncommitments to making the fight on poverty more\neffective \u2014 an objective that is interlinked with peace\nand security in the modern world.\nIn that vein, we welcome the initiative of Brazil,\nFrance, Chile and Spain confirming the need, in the\nfight against hunger and poverty, for greater and more\neffective efforts to place stability and global security\non a solid foundation. If we all apply our will and\ncommitment, we can develop new programmes and\nidentify innovative public policies that will allow us to\nachieve the Millennium Goals.\n15\n\nThroughout its history, El Salvador has been a\ncountry of emigration. The flow of emigration was\nintensified by the war, and today virtually one third of\nour population lives abroad. Maintaining and\ndeepening links with the country of origin is one of the\nmain policies of our administration. Our national\nreality requires us to integrate the views of Salvadorans\nabroad with local expectations. The economic impact\nof this phenomenon is decisive to our life as a nation,\nbut equally or even more important is the sociological\nand cultural impact of the situation. The phenomenon\nof transculturization experienced by our society is\nchanging El Salvador forever.\nThe contribution of migrants to their countries of\norigin and to their host countries deserves special\nattention from the international community, and\nparticularly from the specialized agencies of the United\nNations system. The transfer of remittances is a key\nelement in the mobilization of resources for the\neradication of poverty and the attainment of the\nMillennium Goals. The reduction of the cost of\nremittances should be a concern of the international\ncommunity. From that standpoint, I am pleased to\nexpress our great interest in participating actively in\nthe high-level dialogue on international migration and\ndevelopment, to be held in 2006.\nWe welcome the United States proposal to create\na fund for democracy. In the same vein, El Salvador\nwelcomes the General Assembly\u2019s proclamation of\n2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. The\nproclamation can promote the strengthening of micro-,\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, which represent a\nbroad spectrum of the social fabric and help sustain\nnational progress.\nIn today\u2019s world, globalization has put us all on\nthe map of international reality. It promotes the\ndynamic of strategic alliances in trade and all other\nfields, and makes it possible to build models for\ndevelopment by comparing them with other\nexperiences. Gradually and in a balanced manner, we\nhave decided to strengthen our links of cooperation\nwith various developed countries. The prevailing\nregionalization makes us all dependent on one another.\nIn the case of countries such as ours, the situation leads\nus to nurture our energies and creativity, open markets,\npromote financial flows, facilitate the transfer of\ntechnology and encourage competitiveness. These are\nmajor opportunities and challenges that we must all\naccept.\nWhile cooperation for development remains\nfundamental, El Salvador reiterates the urgent need for\na system of multilateral trade that is open, fair, rule-\nbased, foreseeable and non-discriminatory, in\naccordance with the objectives of the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nIn a world that is becoming increasingly\nglobalized and therefore increasingly interdependent,\neconomic phenomena affect us all in a chain reaction.\nThe current international energy situation has a\nsignificant impact on the economies of our countries,\nwith a negative effect on the dynamics of growth and\nprogress. Thus, from this United Nations rostrum we\nstrongly urge that we explore, as an organized\ncommunity, not only short-term avenues for\novercoming the crises, but also structural remedies that\ncan help the most vulnerable countries, in particular. It\nis contradictory to talk about combating poverty and\nhunger while the consumer countries are paying such\nhigh prices for petroleum.\nThe complex Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a\nsource of enormous concern to our country, given the\nincessant violence, the lack of control over terrorist\ngroups and the ever-growing difficulty of returning to\ndialogue and political understanding. Our country\nreiterates, as it has done consistently, its support for\nany effort and measure to open space for a negotiated\npolitical solution that takes into account the legitimate\ninterests of the parties directly involved.\nAs for the Republic of China on Taiwan, that is a\ncase which the community of nations must examine in\nthe light of international realities. Resolution 2758\n(XXVI) of 1971 did not resolve the issue of the\nrepresentation of the Taiwanese people in the United\nNations. That nation has developed politically,\neconomically and socially in an independent, free and\ndemocratic way. It has its own institutions and\ncharacteristics, just like any other State of the\ninternational community. However, Taiwan\u2019s situation\nin the international community is exceptional, because\nits absence from this forum is a denial of the exercise\nof the rights that are recognized to other peoples and of\nthe universal and democratic nature of our\nOrganization. Our delegation therefore supports\nconsideration of the exceptional situation of the\npopulation of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its\neventual participation in this forum and other\ninternational organizations.\n16\n\nOur Organization has played, is playing and will\ncontinue to play a decisive role in maintaining the\nworld\u2019s healthy balance. Reality is changing\nconstantly. Many things have been left behind and\nmany things await us. Institutions in all areas and at all\nlevels must evolve with the changing times. In that\nvein, we associate ourselves with those who are\ncommitted to the structural renewal of the United\nNations. We believe that such reform must encompass\nthe highest structures, including the Security Council.\nEvery year, the nations of the world, through their\nrepresentatives, attend this rendezvous with the destiny\nof the world. We have the responsibility to do nothing\nless than to build a better world for current and future\ngenerations. Every word, every gesture and every\ndecision made or reached here must be aimed at that\nlofty purpose. Only if we combine our efforts can a\nnew, safer, fairer, more peaceful and more sharing\nreality emerge. Together with all the nations\nrepresented here, El Salvador takes up the challenge of\njoining in that concert of constructive wills, in the\nconfidence that the god of nations will illuminate and\nencourage us so that we may fulfil his will for peace\nand brotherhood in a world in which no one is left\nbehind."

        "file_text": "I should like, Sir, to\ncongratulate you on your assumption of the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. This\nsession might well prove to be epoch-making in that\nthis body will be called upon to consider and to make\nfar-reaching decisions on what ought to be done to\nrevitalize our Organization and to better align it to fit\ntoday\u00eds imperatives for global security, peace and\ndevelopment. I have no doubt that you will live up to\nour expectations and that, given your wisdom and vast\nexperience, you will guide our deliberations to a\nsuccessful outcome. You may rest assured, Mr. President,\nthat you will receive my delegation\u00eds fullest cooperation.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to your predecessor, the very energetic and\ndynamic outgoing President, Mr. Julian E. Hunte, who\nconducted the business of the fifty-eighth session with\ngusto, dedication and courage, and who helped us to\naddress some difficult issues. My delegation wishes\nhim all the very best in his future endeavours.\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\nexpress my deep appreciation for yet another year of\ndedicated service to the Organization \u00f3 indeed, to\nhumanity at large. Some of the problems that were laid\nbefore him were not easy to resolve but, as expected,\nresolved they were. I hope that his efforts to ensure the\ntriumph of multilateralism, the resolution of disputes\nand the pursuit of meaningful cooperation among\nnations will be further bolstered during the session that\nis just beginning.\nI stand here representing the young people of the\nworld. My statement is very long, and is divided into\ntwo parts: one part will be circulated to\nrepresentatives; I will read out the other part.\nWorld leaders have stood at this rostrum on many\noccasions, addressing the world. We made pledges to\nthe children of the world during the twenty-seventh\nspecial session \u00f3 the children\u00eds summit \u00f3 in 2002.\nDuring that special session, we pledged to create a\nbetter world and an environment conducive to the\nwellbeing of the children of the world. We have also\ncome up with objectives for global development so as\nto make the world a better place for humanity by 2015.\nSo far, there is no indication that those objectives will\nbe achieved in the next 2,000 years.\nWhat are the problems? Since the children\u00eds\nsummit took place, we have seen the condition of the\nworld\u00eds children become more and more desperate.\nChildren are being butchered throughout the world.\nChildren\u00eds rights are being violated. Children are being\nsold into slavery, and they are being terrorized by\nadults \u00f3 we, who are supposed to take care of them.\nWe have seen the economies of small States\ncollapse as a result of rising oil prices. I come from a\nvolatile part of the world, but I do not represent only\nAfrica; I represent the young people of the world, whose\nfuture is very bleak if the status quo is not addressed.\nWhat are the problems of humanity today? They\nare man-made problems, and, because they are man-\nmade, we will be able to resolve them. The solution to\nthose problems lies with us, human beings \u00f3\nirrespective of race, colour, creed or religion.\nThe problem of development can best be\nsummarized thus: as long as there is violence and as long\nas there is no peace or global security, we, the poorer\nparts of humanity, will always become poorer and poorer,\nwhile the richer nations will become richer and richer.\n5\n\nThere cannot be any development without peace\nand stability. There cannot be peace or stability without\ndemocracy, justice and equality. The main problem of\nhumanity today \u00f3 which is creating all our other\nproblems - is a result of four human tendencies:\ngreed, double standards, intolerance and hypocrisy.\nNone of us here can look into the faces of our\nchildren and assure them of a bright future or of their\nsafety. Because of greed, human life has been reduced\nto naught. People want to become rich at the expense\nof human life. Greed can come in many forms. The\ninsatiable appetite for world domination and\nintolerance - those are things that face humanity today.\nOur problem is not a confrontation between Islam\nand other religions. The problem of terrorism is a\nhuman characteristic. No good Muslim would ever\ncommit a terrorist act. But, because the world has\nbecome so bad, lawlessness is rampant, and those who\nwant to take out their frustrations on other human\nbeings can do so in the name of Islam or any other\nreligion.\nI have listened to my colleagues who have spoken\nhere. But, as long as certain issues are not addressed,\nthere will be no peace, and the war against terror will\nbecome an elusive fight that we will always lose.\nSome of us believe that, because we disapproved\nof the war in Iraq in the beginning, it is not our\nbusiness to help solve it now. But let me assure the\nAssembly that the war in Iraq has more far-reaching\nconsequences for humanity \u00f3 and particularly for the\nchildren whom we pledged to support at the World\nSummit for Children - than for anything else. We\nhave seen our economies collapse because of high oil\nprices that rise higher every day. It is our collective\nresponsibility to put an end to the war in Iraq. We have\nseen the rise of global terrorism; the world is a more\ndangerous place today than during the cold war. The\nwar in Iraq \u00f3 regardless of whether or not we\nsupported it \u00f3 is a human tragedy, and it is not in our\ninterests, as the human race, to let that war continue\nbecause we disapprove of what has happened. Two\nwrongs cannot make a right. Even if we believe that\nthe war was wrong, it is the responsibility of the entire\nhuman race to help put an end to the suffering of the\nIraqi people. We have seen children being butchered in\nBeslan, Russia; we have seen Palestinian and Israeli\nchildren being butchered. The problem is not a\nreligious problem but a political one, because we, the\nleaders of the world, want to teach others a lesson by\nmaking them suffer. That is a human tragedy.\nWe cannot be diplomats here if we want to solve\nthe world\u00eds problems. It is amazing that, when certain\nactions that are described as terrorist acts are carried\nout by other parties, they are described as retaliation\nfor something. An unlawful act that destroys human\nlife is a terrorist act, regardless of its objective or the\nrationale behind it.\nIf poverty is not addressed, there will be\ndesperation and hunger. And, if human beings are\ndesperate, they can resort to actions that are horrific to\nthe rest of us. We have seen that some parts of the\nworld are very rich and that other parts - including\nAfrica, where I come from - are becoming poorer and\npoorer. If the world's wealth is not distributed equally,\nthere will be imbalances and inequities, and there will\nbe people who are desperate. If people are desperate,\nthey will do anything to survive.\nHowever, that does not mean that one can justify\nviolence. I do not justify violence in any form, because\nI believe that peace and stability would augur well for\nour children. The fight against terror is global. Let us\nbe mindful of the consequences of allowing terror to be\nseen as a legitimate act.\nWe have seen double standards being applied\nwhen resolutions are adopted for the good of humanity\nby the international community \u00f3 which is represented\nhere \u00f3 and, in some cases, are enforced to the letter,\nwhereas a few States are above international law and\nUnited Nations resolutions.\nThat brings me to the issue of nuclear weapons.\nAs a human being and as a peacemaker, I believe that,\nfollowing the end of the cold war, no nation should\nhave been able to justify the possession of nuclear\nweapons, much less become a new nuclear Power. If\npowerful nations continue to keep their nuclear\nweapons - and there are many double standards in the\nway we deal with one another \u00f3 that will only become\nan enticement for others to opt for nuclear weapons\nbecause they think such weapons will serve as an\ninsurance policy against attacks.\nI know that, during the 1980s, there was a\ncampaign to promote nuclear disarmament. Today, in\nthe new millennium, that campaign should be\nstrengthened through a United Nations resolution\nmaking it illegal for anyone to possess nuclear\n6\n\nweapons. We have seen conflicts simmering that will\nhave drastic consequences for humanity - conflicts\naimed at preventing certain States from acquiring\nnuclear weapons. Now that the Soviet empire no longer\nexists, all nuclear weapons - whether they are\npossessed by the Gambia or by any other country -\nshould be eliminated. Just imagine one bomb killing\nmillions of people. And here we stand, telling everyone\nthat the world will be a better place for mankind. I believe\nin the peaceful resolution of all conflicts. Indeed, as far\nas I know, there is no licensing authority for the\npossession of nuclear weapons; therefore, no one can\ndecide who should and who should not have them.\nWe should take a bold step to ensure that no one\nhas nuclear weapons. In this forum, on behalf of the\nworld\u00eds children, I appeal to those who aspire to\npossess nuclear weapons that that is the wrong path to\ntake. Peace and stability cannot be ensured through the\npossession of nuclear weapons. The strength of a\nnation is not based on its firepower or its nuclear\narsenal, but is determined by its ability to make the\nworld a better place for humanity, including its own\ncitizens. Nuclear weapons are not a solution."

        "file_text": "First of all, Sir, let me\nadd my voice to the congratulations on your election to\nthe high office of President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session and express confidence that,\nunder your leadership, it will be successful and fruitful.\nI would like to begin by supporting the statement\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan concerning the\ncrucial importance of fostering the rule of law, both at\nhome and in the framework of international relations,\n29\n\nfor the solution of the topical issues of the modern\nworld.\nToday, the whole system of international relations\nis under vicious attack. We are witnessing the growing\nreach and brutality of international terrorism and\norganized crime, the alarming degradation of our\nenvironment and the spread of poverty, misery and\ndisease.\nEvery year, we keep repeating that the challenges\nand threats to humanity have become global and that\nthe international community should make joint efforts\nto address these challenges effectively and with\ndetermination. But, with our words still resonating in\nthe air, these problems continue to place a heavy\nburden on human beings.\nFor years, the international community has been\nignoring the most burning problems of social and\neconomic development and has failed to address\npoverty, misery, illiteracy and various forms of\ndiscrimination. As a result, we are faced with an\nunprecedented threat of international terrorism, which\nundermines the pillars of the world economy and\nsecurity. Nevertheless, we have not yet done anything\nmeaningful to get a detailed analysis of the ideology\nbehind international terrorism, its institutional base and\nits sources of financing. In other words, the central\nnature of international terrorism remains terra\nincognita for all of us; we are familiar only with its\nugly manifestations.\nRecent alarming developments in the world,\nespecially the massacre in Beslan, have again\nhighlighted the urgent need to reform the United\nNations. We cannot meet new challenges and address\ntoday\u2019s acute problems if we continue to rely on old\napproaches. The central issue of international security\nis turning the United Nations into an effective tool\ndesigned to strengthen regional and global security\nsystems, the regime of non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and management of globalization\nprocesses.\nAs a matter of principle, we consider it important\nto ensure balance in the functioning of the General\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and\nSocial Council, as envisioned in the Charter of this\nOrganization. We insist on the need to strengthen the\nrole of the General Assembly in the settlement of the\nmost important issues facing humanity today. In our\nview, the international community\u2019s efforts to combat\nterrorism and to settle armed conflicts can be more\neffective only on the basis of such an approach.\nKazakhstan has supported the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s decision to establish a high-level panel on\nUnited Nations reform. We believe that this panel, with\nits broad mandate and wide-ranging powers, should\narrive at an acceptable solution to this present crucial\nissue. Kazakhstan holds the view that, in its current\nform, the Security Council no longer reflects the\nrealities of our world. I share the opinion of the Prime\nMinister of Japan, Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, that the\n\u201cenemy State\u201d clauses in the United Nations Charter\nare obsolete. The Security Council should be\nrevitalized by the addition of new permanent and non-\npermanent members. Asia, Africa and Latin America\nshould have a wider representation in the Security\nCouncil and should be directly involved in the search\nfor solutions to the important problems facing the\ninternational community.\nKazakhstan calls for the establishment of a\ncouncil of regional organizations under the auspices of\nthe United Nations Secretary-General. Close attention\nshould be paid to the proposal to establish an economic\nand social security council. We believe that these\nproposals reflect the need to strengthen global\nmultilateral cooperation.\nOur country continues to believe that the United\nNations is the only genuinely universal international\norganization responsible for the issues of war and\npeace, acting as a guarantor of international law.\nIt is encouraging that the reform of the United\nNations Security Council Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee is gaining momentum. With the current\nescalation of international terrorism, the role of this\nCommittee should become more important; otherwise,\nglobal counter-terrorism efforts to address new\nchallenges and threats will not be so effective, and this\nruns counter to the wishes of the peoples of the world.\nMr. Belkhadem (Algeria),Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nOur country supports the United Nations\npeacekeeping effort and the continued strengthening of\nits capacity in this area. With escalating humanitarian\ncrises and armed conflicts, as effectively demonstrated\nby the developments in Darfur, the United Nations\nshould pay special attention to the possibility of\nbroader participation by authoritative regional and\n30\n\nsubregional organizations in peacekeeping operations,\nwhich would allow a more effective and timely\nresponse to emerging threats.\nYet, one key issue is the prevention of conflicts\nand crises. For this reason, Kazakhstan is a firm\nsupporter of preventive diplomacy and continues to\nbelieve that the establishment of a Central Asian\npreventive diplomacy centre is a timely initiative.\nIn our view, there is an urgent need to coordinate\nthe efforts of the entire international community in the\narea of disarmament and arms control. We call for an\nearly entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty and urge the Governments of those\nStates that have not yet ratified this instrument to\ndisplay political will and genuine commitment to\nnuclear disarmament.\nAs one of the few States that have voluntarily\ngiven up their nuclear weapons, Kazakhstan is\nconcerned by the current status of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. This important treaty has been\nseriously eroded because of destructive actions on the\npart of a number of known States. We should recognize\nthat the non-proliferation regime faces a formidable\nthreat, and there is a real possibility of an uncontrolled\nspread of weapons of mass destruction and, most\nimportant, of terrorists getting hold of them. In view of\nthis, we consider the establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia to be a very\nimportant and timely proposal.\nWe believe that the negotiation process within the\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva should be\nreactivated. In our view, the potential of this important\nforum is far from being tapped to its full extent.\nThe Government of Kazakhstan attaches great\nimportance to the consistent implementation of the\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\nWeapons, as discussed at a regional conference in\nAlmaty in March of 2004.\nFor us, it is very important that the Iraqi issue is\nagain in the political realm of the United Nations.\nEmphasizing the need to ensure the independence,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, Kazakhstan\nwelcomes the transfer of authority and responsibility\nfor the administration of the country to the Interim\nGovernment of Iraq and calls on the Iraqi people to\ncome together in the name of national unity and\nconciliation.\nThe participation of a unit of the armed forces of\nKazakhstan in the multinational force in Iraq is a\ndemonstration of our country\u2019s commitment to the\nimplementation of its obligations towards the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nContinued instability in the Middle East is a\nmatter of grave concern to Kazakhstan. From our point\nof view, the resumption and advancement of the peace\nprocess, on all tracks, and the implementation by all\nparties to the conflict in the Middle East of their\ncommitments, as reflected in the road map and relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, should remain the main\ngoal of all those concerned.\nKazakhstan supports the efforts of the current\nGovernment in Afghanistan to consolidate peace and\nsecurity in the country and address social, economic\nand humanitarian issues. We expect that the\ninternational community, starting with all the\ndeveloped countries, will live up to their commitments\nwith regard to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. As for\nour country, we are ready to contribute to the process,\nwithin our means.\nWe believe that the well-being of the Central\nAsian region is largely dependent on the normalization\nof the situation in Afghanistan. We have every reason\nto be concerned by such problems as the increasing\nspread of drugs, illegal migration and surging religious\nextremism. Together with poverty, ecological\ndegradation and the lack of water resources, these\nphenomena provide a breeding ground for international\nterrorism, which is gaining force in our region.\nIn view of that, Kazakhstan supports the activities\nof the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime in\nCentral Asia, particularly the adoption of a regional\nplan of action to control the illicit spread of drugs in\nthe States neighbouring Afghanistan and the\nestablishment of a security belt around that country.\nWe believe that the deployment in Afghanistan \u2014\nunder the auspices of NATO \u2014 of the International\nSecurity Assistance Force is an important factor in the\nrestoration of peace and security in the country.\nKazakhstan\u2019s initiative regarding the Conference\non Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in\nAsia (CICA) \u2014 already a fact of international life \u2014 is\nan effective tool designed to strengthen confidence and\n31\n\nsecurity in Asia. The first CICA summit, held in June\nof 2002, became a milestone in that process and paved\nthe way for practical efforts to institutionalize the\nConference.\nThe draft catalogue of confidence-building\nmeasures and the draft rules of procedure have already\nbeen agreed and are expected to be adopted at a\nministerial meeting of the CICA countries, scheduled\nto be held in October 2004 in Almaty. The adoption of\nthe catalogue will create a unique document\nencompassing a range of measures in the military,\npolitical, economic, cultural and environmental areas\ndesigned to strengthen security and confidence in Asia.\nAs a newly independent State, Kazakhstan wants\nto contribute to global harmony and stability. The fact\nthat our multi-ethnic State enjoys a large degree of\ninter-confessional and inter-ethnic accord says a lot;\nfirst of all, it is a confirmation that Kazakhstan has\nbecome an integral part of the civilized community. We\ncategorically reject the concept of the clash of\ncivilizations and consider it to be counterproductive\nand harmful, because it serves as a justification for\ninternational conflicts and the barbaric actions of\ninternational terrorists.\nKazakhstan firmly believes that dialogue and\nharmony among civilizations are not only possible but\nalso necessary. For that reason, our head of State\ninitiated a congress of world religions, held in Astana\nin September of 2003. The success of that forum has\nstrengthened our conviction that it is absolutely\nessential to establish a dialogue and ensure peaceful\ncoexistence between religions and civilizations, in the\ninterests of peace and global security.\nKazakhstan reaffirms its strong commitment to\nintegration and multilateral cooperation at the regional\nlevel. This approach, which promotes the sustainable\nsocial and economic development of Kazakhstan, is\nfully within our long-term interests. Such institutions\nas the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the\nEurasian Economic Community, the Organization of\nCentral Asian Cooperation and the Economic\nCooperation Organization play an ever-increasing role\nin the efforts to strengthen security, develop economic\ncooperation and create conditions for the prosperity of\nour large region.\nWe have great expectations regarding integration\nwithin the framework of the single economic space\nmade up of the territories of Belarus, Kazakhstan,\nRussia and Ukraine. Our country also supports the\nstrengthening of the capacity of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS) as a major and influential\ninternational organization. Recently, President\nNursultan Nazarbaev has made concrete proposals\nconcerning the reform of the Commonwealth.\nKazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to the\nimplementation of its obligations towards the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\nand hopes that the upcoming ministerial meeting in\nSofia will develop new approaches to the reform of\nthat organization in order to adapt it to new challenges\nemerging from our region. We also commend the\nresults of the cooperation with NATO within the\nframework of its Partnership for Peace programme and\nconsider the possibility of increasing the level of our\ncooperation with that alliance.\nKazakhstan continues to pay priority attention to\nthe development of its cooperation with Russia, the\nUnited States, China, the countries of Central Asia, the\nEuropean Union and the Asian and Islamic countries.\nWe are now in a position to claim considerable\nprogress in that area, which has allowed us to create\nfavourable external conditions for liberal reforms in\nthe country. Having been given the status of a market\neconomy and enjoying a high rating in the financial\ncommunity, Kazakhstan has been recognized by the\ninternational community as a leader among the post-\nSoviet States in practically all economic indicators,\nincluding direct foreign investments.\nWe welcome the start of a direct dialogue\nbetween the Central Asian States and Japan and\nconsider that form of cooperation to be very\nmeaningful and promising. We also attach great\nimportance to the partnership between our region and\nthe United States in order to create a zone of free trade.\nThe Almaty Programme of Action, adopted by\nthe International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked\nand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries\nand International Financial and Development\nInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, held in\nAugust of 2003 in my country, has provided to the\nlandlocked Central Asian States an important tool for\nthe solution of their trade and transit problems. We\nhope that the needs of inland States will be duly taken\ninto account in trade negotiations in order to provide\nappropriate privileges and preferences to that group of\ncountries.\n32\n\nIt is a well-established fact that the transportation\npolicies of many countries, including Kazakhstan, are\nclosely linked to the delivery of hydrocarbons to world\nmarkets. As a country with the potential to become a\nmajor world exporter of oil and gas, Kazakhstan\nattaches great importance to the determination of the\nlegal status of the Caspian Sea and to the signing of a\nconvention on that issue. An agreement by the littoral\nStates on the use of the Caspian Sea exclusively for\npeaceful purposes has become an important\naccomplishment in the negotiation process. Kazakhstan\nholds the view that it is necessary to continue intensive\nefforts in a five-party format, gradually overcoming\nexisting differences in the search for solutions that\nwould agree with the fundamental principles of\ninternational law and promote the final determination\nof the legal status of the Caspian Sea.\nKazakhstan is gravely concerned by the fate of\nanother sea \u2014 the Aral Sea. The continued degradation\nof the environment of the region seriously affects the\nhealth and livelihood of the population. The situation\nin the Aral Sea region has acquired global dimensions;\nthe salt from its seabed has long been present in the air\nin Europe and Asia, and even over the North Pole. Yet\nthe international community, unfortunately, is not fully\naware of the grave ramifications of this environmental\ndisaster. Technical assistance and financial aid to the\npopulation of that long-suffering region have been\nsporadic. We believe that a special General Assembly\nresolution on the Aral Sea has long been overdue.\nWe also urge the international community to\nreactivate fruitful cooperation in the solution of social\nand economic problems facing the population around\nthe former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. The\npeople of the region were the unwitting victims of\nsome 500 nuclear-weapons tests conducted in the heat\nof the global arms race. We are grateful to the\nGovernments of Japan, the United States and other\ndonor States for the due attention being paid by them\nto this screaming problem, yet we believe that, in this\nparticular case, multilateral cooperation would have\nbeen more effective. The framework for such\ncooperation is already in place in the form of a relevant\nGeneral Assembly resolution, whose potential has not\nbeen used to the full.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that\nKazakhstan will continue to exert every effort to\nstrengthen global and regional stability, fight terrorism\nand meet other challenges that we face today."

        "file_text": "I have the greatest honour to\nspeak on behalf of the people of Tuvalu, who wish me\nfirst of all to convey their warmest greetings to this\nsession of the General Assembly. We also extend our\nsincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\nelection and assure you of our full cooperation.\n18\n\nWe congratulate the outgoing President, Mr.\nJulian Hunte of Saint Lucia, for his excellent\nleadership. Coming from a small island developing State\nourselves, we are proud of the many achievements so\nably accomplished under his presidency.\nWe would also like to extend our warmest\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand his staff for their dedication to the work of the\nUnited Nations. The United Nations, through the\nSecretary-General\u2019s High Representative, participated\nin the Pacific Island Forum Leaders meeting, held in\nSamoa last month, at which a new strategy for regional\ncooperation in the Pacific, the Pacific Plan, was\nconsidered.\nThat is highly commendable. Like all Forum\nmembers, Tuvalu looks forward to United Nations\nsolidarity and support, bilaterally and through the\nPacific Island Forum and other Pacific regional\norganizations, in order to realize that Pacific initiative.\nTuvalu is privileged and proud to be in this most\nindispensable body, the United Nations. Our presence\nhere demonstrates our belief in the noble principles and\ngoals of the United Nations. At the same time,\nhowever, we are constantly reminded of our\nresponsibilities to all Tuvaluans, who every day worry\nabout their future economic, cultural, environmental\nand long-term security and survival on our small,\nisolated and extremely vulnerable islands.\nTuvuluans wonder if the pride of being in the\nUnited Nations is commensurate with the many aspired\nneeds of our people. Is there any real value of being at\nthe United Nations to the villagers and local\ncommunities, who can barely overcome the limitations\nposed by the lack of opportunities, marginalization,\nisolation, economic exclusion and their extreme\nvulnerability?\nIt is our strong belief that to maintain its\nlegitimacy and relevance to all, the United Nations\nneeds to reassess its role and functions in order to\nbetter reflect the reality of today\u2019s world, in line with\nits principle of sovereign, equitable participation and\nrepresentation. We therefore support ongoing reforms\nin the work of the United Nations. In particular, we\nsupport the increase in the number of both permanent\nand non-permanent seats in the Security Council.\nExpansion, in our view, should be considered on the\nbasis of responsible contribution to international\ndevelopment and peace, and in this vein we would\nsupport the allocation of a permanent seat to Japan. We\nalso believe more equitable representation of the\ndeveloping countries in the non-permanent seats of the\nCouncil is vital and long overdue.\nSecurity challenges continue to create worldwide\nhavoc, fear and uncertainty. Terrorist acts, including\nthe unfortunate seizure of a school in Russia, have\nproven the continued existence of forces bent on\nundermining the United Nations founding goals of\nfreedom, peace and security. They have also\nunderscored the urgency with which we, the United\nNations, must collectively combat these forces.\nTuvalu is fully committed to joining the fight\nagainst international terrorism as required by Security\nCouncil resolutions. But we would need to seek the\nassistance of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to help us fulfil those requirements,\nparticularly the reporting requirements of those\nresolutions and of the international anti-terrorism\nconventions.\nTuvalu recognizes the seriousness of the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic in relation to the social and\neconomic development and security of Tuvalu and\nother Pacific island countries. Given our exposure and\nthe level of mobility of our communities, particularly\nour seafarers who serve on merchant ships worldwide,\nthere is an urgent need for assistance from the\ninternational community, such as that provided under\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\nMalaria, in order to combat the threats of the epidemic.\nAs is widely acknowledged, a serious challenge\nto Tuvalu and to all small island developing States is our\nunique vulnerability to external forces. That vulnerability\narises not from our own actions but simply from our\nbeing islands with small economies, our isolation, our\nfragmentation and the fragility of our natural\nenvironments. These factors taken together translate into\nsignificant constraints on development and a severe lack\nof capacity to cope with the many changes taking place\nin the world, especially through globalization.\nYet for us in small island developing States,\nalthough we witness daily the forces of trade,\ncommunications and travel creating a single global\ncommunity, the problems associated with poverty, lack\nof opportunity, marginalization and environmental\ndecline continue to plague our efforts. There is a\ngenuine need for the United Nations and the\ninternational community to better recognize the special\n19\n\nand unique circumstances of small island developing\nStates and their aspirations to participate more\nequitably in a globalized world.\nSustainable development, particularly for the\nmost disadvantaged and vulnerable developing States,\nis most crucial. In June, Tuvalu undertook a\ncomprehensive review of its development priorities and\nadopted a national sustainable development strategy\nthat we call \u201cThe Tuvalu Vision 2015\u201d, premised on\ninternational development agendas, including the\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, and aimed at building Tuvalu\u2019s resilience in\ncoping with the challenges it faces.\nThe promotion of good governance, democratic\nprinciples and respect for the rule of law is strongly\nrecognized as fundamental to the successful\nimplementation of that strategy. We acknowledge with\ngreatest appreciation the generous support of the\nGovernments of Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the\nUnited Kingdom, Italy and the Republic of China on\nTaiwan, the United Nations Department of Economic\nand Social Affairs and the Asian Development Bank in\nthat exercise. We look forward to partnering with them,\nand with others in the international community, in the\nrealization of that strategy.\nAs a poorly resourced small island developing\nState and a least developed country as well, even our best\nefforts to escape the cycle of poverty and marginalization\nare doomed to failure without the meaningful support of\nthe international community, civil society and the\nprivate sector. The Millennium Declaration, the\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation have all provided clear road maps for\npartnerships towards sustainable development. The\nsignposts offered under these road maps will remain\nmere rhetoric unless they translate into real\ndevelopments, responsive to the unique needs of small\nisland developing States such as Tuvalu.\nIt is for these reasons that full and effective\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States is ever so crucial. Tuvalu is very\nencouraged by the progress so far achieved in the\nreview of the Programme.\nHowever, success in the further implementation\nof the Barbados Programme of Action will depend\nentirely on a better appreciation of the unique situation\nof small island developing States such as Tuvalu, easier\naccess to and the provision of adequate financial and\ntechnical resources, development aid and the\ndissemination of appropriate technology, particularly\nfor new and renewable energy and capacity-building.\nIn terms of natural resources, Tuvalu is truly a\nsmall island country in a big ocean. The Pacific Ocean\nsurrounding our islands provides the vital source of our\nlivelihoods and our economic and social development.\nIncreasingly, however, we are concerned with the real\nthreats of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\nand of ocean pollution from waste, particularly from the\ntrans-shipment of highly radioactive and toxic materials\nthrough our region. We seek the understanding of the\ninternational community to help us save our oceans and\nsupport fully the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy\nadopted by our Government leaders in 2002.\nThe overall decline in overseas development\nassistance in real terms is cause for serious concern.\nThe failure of developed countries to fulfil the United\nNations minimum target of providing 0.7 per cent of\ntheir gross national product in overseas development\nassistance to small island developing States translates into\nlower economic growth as well as a further widening\ndevelopment gap for small island developing States\nsuch as Tuvalu. This needs to be addressed urgently.\nAn important source of financial flows to\ndeveloping countries, particularly to small island\ndeveloping States such as Tuvalu, is migrant workers\u2019\nremittances from developed countries. Indeed,\nremittances from our overseas workers, and\nparticularly Tuvaluan seafarers serving abroad, provide\na substantial source of income, which is so vital for\nsocial and economic development in Tuvalu. Tuvalu\nfully supports giving urgent international attention to\nthe issue of migrant workers\u2019 rights, including the\nmaintenance of international standards specifying\nminimum requirements for certificates of competency\nand provisions for the safety and security of migrant\nworkers, in order to ensure the continuation of this\nvital source of capital for SIDS.\nThe international meeting in Mauritius in January\nmust result in a stronger commitment from the\ninternational community and in pragmatic and doable\nactions on the ground in all small island developing\nStates.\nAn issue of continuing concern to Tuvalu is the\nquestion of the representation of the Republic of China\n20\n\non Taiwan in the United Nations. Regrettably, this\nOrganization cannot be said to be universal without the\nrightful representation of the 23 million people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Tuvalu feels that the\nactive and responsible participation of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan in world affairs \u2014 especially in trade,\ncommerce and international development \u2014 without\nrepresentation in the United Nations is unjust and\nmorally wrong and needs to be corrected.\nWe in Tuvalu, a mere three meters above sea\nlevel, live in constant fear of the adverse impact of\nclimate change and the rising sea level. Our livelihoods\nand sources of food security are already badly affected.\nWith increased ground water salinity, land erosion and\ncoral bleaching, we experience total anxiety. The threat\nis real and serious and is like a slow and insidious form\nof terrorism against Tuvalu.\nTuvalu, therefore, accords significant importance\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, as they\nprovide the most appropriate global framework to\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. We congratulate\nthe Framework Convention secretariat as the\nConvention marks its tenth anniversary this year.\nHowever, we are deeply concerned by the failure and\nthe lack of leadership on the part of industrialized\ncountries in the implementation of commitments and in\nthe ratification and enforcing of the Kyoto Protocol.\nWe in small island developing States recognize\nthat all nations must take steps to mitigate greenhouse\ngas emissions at some stage. However, Tuvalu believes\nthat the Kyoto Protocol must be the first step in this\ndirection for now and for setting the way forward in\nthe future. The Protocol as such must enter into force\nwithout delay. However, the industrialized countries\nmust act first as it is their legacy of emissions that is\ncreating the problems of today. Actions must also\ninclude assisting small island developing States in their\nadaptation to the adverse effects of climate change,\nparticularly in terms of urgently providing adequate\nfinancial and technical resources in line with the\nresponsibilities and obligations under the Framework\nConvention.\nAs we mark the tenth anniversary of the\nFramework Convention, and as we begin to explore\nfuture actions against climate change and sea-level\nrise, we appeal for more attention from the United\nNations, whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to ensure world peace\nand security, and for stronger leadership by the\ninternational community against this global threat.\nIn conclusion, we want to say that efforts aimed\nat the sustainable development of small island States\nlike Tuvalu will have no meaning unless the issue of\nclimate change and sea level is addressed decisively\nand with urgency. Tuvalu\u2019s interest in enforcing Kyoto\nis not self-serving. The more serious consequences of\nnot acting now, as we are already witnessing the world\nover, will be felt everywhere.\nIt is our hope that, out of this common house of\nour United Nations family, there will emerge better\nunderstanding and goodwill for the long-lasting\nsecurity and survival of Tuvalu, of SIDS and of the\nwhole world.\nGod bless the United Nations."

There can be no lasting peace in any part\nof the world when millions of people suffer every day\nfrom deprivation, poverty, armed conflicts and\nterrorism. There is no human dignity when even the\nmost basic human rights of millions of people are\nviolated every day. There is no equality as long as\nthere is discrimination because of gender, race or\nbeliefs. There is no fairness when international and\ndomestic rules favour the rich and powerful and\noppress the poor and weak.\nWe, the family of nations, cannot remain on the\nsidelines. We need multilateral tools to meet the\nchallenges of a globalized world. We must develop and\nenhance our multilateral institutions. This applies\nespecially to the United Nations, whose position in\npromoting peace and development is unique.\nMember States have given the Security Council\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. The members of the\nSecurity Council \u00f3 and especially its permanent\nmembers \u00f3 must display a common will and\ncompromise on narrowly defined national interests.\nThe other nations must then show support for the\nSecurity Council\u00eds position and its decisions.\nBefore the war in Iraq, however, the international\ncommunity failed. Conflicting national interests\nprevailed over common will. There was not enough\ncommitment to act within the boundaries of Security\nCouncil resolutions. Some nations resorted to the use\nof force, which was not in accordance with\ninternational law.\nBut now we must turn our eyes and energies to\nthe future. We need to restore security and stability in\nIraq so that the building of democracy and prosperity\ncan begin in earnest. Finland is participating in the\ntraining of Iraqi police forces and we have decided to\ncontribute \u00c41 million for security for staff members of\nthe United Nations system working in Iraq.\nThere is no sustainable alternative to\nmultilateralism. The international community must\nrecognize its collective responsibility. We must be able\nto intervene and prevent situations in which human\nrights are seriously violated.\nWe cannot afford to let the Darfur situation get\nout of hand. The United Nations and the international\ncommunity must be able to act in time, effectively and\nas long as needed. I thank the Secretary-General for his\npromise of action today.\nGlobalization could and should be a force for a\nbrighter future for all people. However, globalization\nas we experience it today falls far short of this promise\nand is ethically and politically unsustainable. To\nimplement the Millennium Declaration, we need to\nmake globalization more fair and attentive to people\u00eds\nneeds and aspirations. This requires more coherence,\ncloser and better international cooperation and stronger\ndemocratic States that work for fairness at home and\nabroad.\nWe must act without delay in order to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals. We have agreed on\nadditional resources, we have agreed on local\nownership and we have agreed on good governance.\nLet us deliver on these promises. The poor of the world\ncannot wait. We must make the 0.7 per cent target on\ndevelopment assistance a reality. We need to give\nopen-minded consideration to new and innovative\n4\n\nproposals for additional development funding,\nincluding international taxation.\nOne concrete indication of the desire to\nimplement the Millennium Declaration is the World\nCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.\nThe Commission has drafted numerous\nrecommendations which the United Nations system\nshould study before the review of the Millennium\nDeclaration next autumn. Tanzania and Finland will\npresent an initiative for this session of the General\nAssembly to deal with the Commission\u00eds\nrecommendations in the United Nations.\nThe United Nations has a key role today and\ntomorrow in promoting peace, security, economic\nprosperity, social welfare, human rights and the rule of\nlaw. Finland gives full support to the broad reform of\nthe United Nations that is now underway. The time is\nripe for a reform of the Security Council and the\nexpansion of its membership so that it better\ncorresponds to today\u00eds world. We also need to vitalize\nthe General Assembly and give the Economic and\nSocial Council the role envisaged in the United\nNations Charter.\nI hope that when we meet here at United Nations\nHeadquarters a year from now, we can proudly note\nthat we have taken concrete steps towards a better\nworld. This is a responsibility that all of us share and I\nknow it requires a lot of work from all of us, but, dear\ncolleagues, let us do it."

        "file_text": "I\nam pleased to express to you, Sir, and to your friendly\ncountry, Gabon, our sincere congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session. We are confident that you will lead\nthe work of this session in a highly capable and\nefficient manner. I should also like to express our\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, who, as\nPresident of the last session of the Assembly, managed\nits affairs with wisdom and skill.\nOn this occasion, I should like to convey the deep\nappreciation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his sustained,\ndiligent and commendable efforts to maintain\ninternational peace and security and to revitalize the\nrole of the United Nations and enhance its functions,\ncapacities, credibility and effectiveness. In that regard,\nthe speech given by the Secretary-General last week is\nnotable and praiseworthy, as it provided a blueprint and\nguidelines for enhancing the resiliency of the\ninternational order. It is crucial when tackling global\nissues to bridge the gaps in the international order so\nthat measures are not applied selectively or arbitrarily.\nThe accelerating global changes and the grave\nchallenges facing the international community today\nnecessitate more than ever a scrutiny of the working\nmethods of the United Nations, as well as the\nstructures and functions of its organs, in order to\nenhance its ability to prevent and resolve conflicts and\nto maintain international peace and security.\nIn that respect, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nsupports the call for reform of the Security Council, in\nparticular, an increase in its membership in order to\nimprove geographical representation, a greater\ntransparency in its work, a halt to the application of\ndouble standards and the adoption of measures that\nwill enhance the credibility of the Council\u2019s work and\nguarantee respect for, and compliance with, its\nresolutions.\nAmong the important reforms needed in our\nOrganization is restriction of the veto power.\nPermanent members of the Security Council should not\nbe allowed to invoke their right of veto in cases where\nproposed resolutions and procedures are adopted to\nimplement previously agreed resolutions.\nIt is also imperative to establish an optimal\nbalance between the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council, to enhance the role of the Economic\nand Social Council and to establish closer coordination\n18\n\namong the various United Nations funds, programmes\nand activities.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the United\nNations and the multilateral international order. Today,\nmore than ever, the international community is in dire\nneed of a unified and mutually supportive stance in\norder to achieve just solutions to the current problems\nwe all face. It is through respect for the shared values,\ntraditions and principles that are deeply rooted in the\nconscience of all mankind that we can promote\nconstructive cooperation and the achievement of\nsecurity, peace, stability and prosperity for all nations.\nHumanity has been afflicted by the growing\ndanger of terrorism. It is a phenomenon that does not\ndifferentiate between societies. Increasingly, terrorist\ngroups have been crossing borders and expanding their\nnetworks into different regions, nations and continents.\nToday, it is therefore critical that we exert every effort\npossible to increase international cooperation to\ncombat terrorism and confront those who instigate and\nfinance it.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rejects terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations and is cooperating with\nthe international community to eliminate that global\nevil. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has affirmed its full\nsupport for the Security Council resolutions relating to\nterrorism. In that regard, Saudi Arabia has taken the\nnecessary steps to close any loopholes in its domestic\nregulations on charitable fund-raising activities that\nmight allow such funds to be used for illicit purposes.\nWe have established a public commission tasked with\nsupervising and organizing the activities of all\ncharitable and relief organizations with a view to\nstreamlining their operations and preventing those with\nbad intentions and evil objectives from using their\nhumanitarian funds for illegal purposes.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was among the\nfirst signatories of the Arab Convention on the\nSuppression of Terrorism and other similar agreements\nemanating from the Organization of the Islamic\nConference and the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council. In\naddition, it has acceded to nine other international anti-\nterrorism conventions and agreements. In that regard,\nthe Government of Saudi Arabia has recently taken a\nseries of measures that are indicative of its seriousness\nand determination to fight terrorism. Its strategy of\npreventive action to forestall criminal acts has already\nbeen successful in the fight against this deadly scourge\nand has earned the praise and admiration of the\ninternational community and international\norganizations.\nIt is important to remember that crimes\ncommitted by a handful of criminals and misguided\nfelons cannot justify incriminating a whole society or\nan entire culture. Terrorism can strike any city and\ntarget any interests, regardless of the nationality,\nreligion or ethnic origin of the victims. Terrorism is a\nglobal phenomenon that calls for joint action and\ncooperation by all countries and requires the close\ncollaboration of concerned international organizations\nto effectively find the means to confront it and\neliminate it.\nIt is on the basis of the foregoing that I am\npleased to announce before this gathering that the\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has\ndecided to host an international conference to combat\nterrorism, to be held in Riyadh from 5 to 8 February\n2005. Its purpose is to exchange information and\nexperience in the field of combating terrorism and to\nsee how we can cooperate with other countries in the\nfight against that universal threat. We also intend to use\nthis excellent opportunity to learn about scientific and\npractical techniques relevant not only to combating\nterrorism, but also to the prevention of money-\nlaundering, drug trafficking and arms smuggling. The\nconference will also provide a good forum in which to\nstudy the culture and psychology of terrorists and the\nstructure of terrorist organizations.\nOfficial invitations to the anti-terrorism\nconference have already been extended to concerned\ninternational organizations as well as to countries that\nhave suffered or are suffering from terrorism. The\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the participation\nof all those invited and hopes that the outcome and\nfinal recommendations of the conference will\nconstitute an important addition and a great support to\ninternational efforts to eradicate terrorism and address\nthe root causes of that dangerous phenomenon.\nThe setback in the peace process and the\nmounting wave of violence and extremism in our\nregion are largely attributable to the Israeli\nGovernment\u2019s pursuit of policies that are totally\nincompatible with the fundamental principles of the\npeace process, notably the principle of land for peace.\nIsrael\u2019s actions are in contravention of Security Council\nresolutions \u2014 in particular, resolutions 242 (1967) and\n19\n\n338 (1973) \u2014 and the road map. They are incompatible\nwith the United States Administration\u2019s vision of two\nStates \u2014 an Israeli State and an independent\nPalestinian State \u2014 living side by side.\nThe Arab peace initiative continues to stand as a\ncredible basis for the security and stability of all the\npeoples of the region because it ensures a lasting, just\nand comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli\nconflict. It is therefore incumbent upon all of us to\nexert our utmost efforts to put the peace process back\non track. It is particularly important to push the peace\nprocess forward after it has stalled and after the\nhumanitarian plight of the Palestinian people \u2014 which\nshould be a goad to the conscience of the international\ncommunity \u2014 has been met with indifference.\nFurthermore, peace cannot be achieved by\nunilateral Israeli measures that create new realities on\nthe ground and that are designed to prejudice the final\noutcome of any political negotiations on the delicate\nissue of a final settlement. The Palestinian question\ncannot be solved, nor can the Arab-Israeli conflict be\nended, through the use of excessive force \u2014 aerial\nbombardment, guided missiles, assassination of\nPalestinian activists, destruction of infrastructure,\nusurpation of property, violation of rights and the\nimposition of collective punishment. Peace will be\nachieved and security will prevail only when United\nNations resolutions are implemented, the provisions of\ninternational law are respected and applied and the\nprinciples of justice and equality are observed.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns the\ncontinuous escalation against the Palestinian people\nand the Israeli Government\u2019s insistence on establishing\nand expanding its settlements. We also condemn the\ncontinued construction of the separation wall that has\nannexed extensive Palestinian lands in unprecedented\ndefiance of the advisory opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice, which acknowledged the illegality of\nthe wall and ordered Israel to dismantle it, as well as\nthe General Assembly resolution that followed that\nopinion, effectively demonstrating the consensus of the\ninternational community on the issue.\nHowever, if Israel is serious about withdrawing\nfrom Gaza and about dismantling its settlements there,\nwe stress that such an action should proceed in\ncoordination with the Palestinian Authority, in\nconformity with the requirements of the road map and\nunder the supervision of the Quartet. The proposed\nwithdrawal should come about as a first step towards a\ncomplete and full withdrawal from all the Palestinian\nlands, including Al-Quds.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely\nmonitoring efforts to eliminate all forms of weapons of\nmass destruction from the Middle East and to keep it\nfree from all such lethal weapons. In that respect, we\ncall upon the international community to adopt an\neven-handed approach, refrain from applying double\nstandards, assume its legal and moral responsibilities\nand urge the Israeli Government to refrain from the\ndevelopment of its nuclear programmes, as well as\nsubject its nuclear installations to the inspection and\nsafeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency.\nWe are profoundly distressed and gravely\nconcerned at the deteriorating security situation in\nsome parts of Iraq, where tragic incidents, heinous acts\nof violence, and the horrific kidnapping of innocent\npeople seem to be daily occurrences. Faced with this\nappalling reality, we can only urge the Iraqi people and\nall Iraqi factions to mend fences and work hand in\nhand to support the efforts of their transitional\nGovernment to establish the security, safety and well-\nbeing of their country; preserve its national unity and\nindependence and ensure the restoration of Iraq\u2019s\neffective and positive role in the international arena.\nWe also call upon the United Nations to play a greater\nrole in assisting the Iraqi Government to meet the\nrequirements of the ongoing political process,\nincluding by conducting general elections, which we\nhope will lead to a permanent legitimate Government,\nand proceeding with reconstruction efforts.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has presented\nsome ideas regarding the deployment of Islamic troops\nin Iraq. With the consent of the Iraqi Government and\nunder United Nations supervision, we would like such\ntroops not to supplement, but to replace, the\nmultilateral forces. Those ideas, however, have not\nmaterialized, although their basic premise deserves\nconsideration and follow-up.\nWith respect to developments in the brotherly\ncountry of the Sudan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is\nprofoundly moved by the humanitarian tragedy in\nDarfur and supports the efforts of the Government of\nthe Sudan to restore stability in that region. We support\nthe Sudan\u2019s cooperation with relief and humanitarian\norganizations and others in addressing the\n20\n\nhumanitarian situation resulting from the crisis. We\nhope that the efforts of the Government of the Sudan\nand those of the African Union will be given sufficient\ntime to restore security to the region and to ensure the\nwell-being of its people.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has initiated an\nongoing airlift operation, using Saudi cargo planes, to\nprovide direct humanitarian assistance to the Darfur\nregion. This assistance includes medical and food\nsupplies, tents and power generators. Moreover, there\nare Saudi relief teams in the region who have\nestablished clinics and hospitals inside camps and\nequipped them with doctors, medicine, medical\nsupplies and tests. In addition, wells have been dug to\nprovide the camps with drinking water, and electricity\nis being supplied.\nHuman development and economic prosperity are\nmajor keys to achieving a better future for developing\ncountries. To reach that objective, developed and\ndeveloping nations can work together to achieve great\nsuccess. My country has contributed to this process by\nadopting and implementing numerous development\nprojects and by extending generous assistance to\ndeveloping and least developed countries through\nnational, regional and international agencies, in order\nto help them in overcoming the problems of poverty\nand underdevelopment.\nWe appreciate the concern expressed by the\nGroup of Eight at their summit in Sea Island, Georgia,\nin the United States, regarding the future of the Middle\nEast and their desire to help the countries of the region\ndevelop and make progress. However, we believe that\npolitical and economic reforms should not be imposed\nor dictated from outside; rather, international assistance\nin this area should serve as a catalyst to help these\nnations initiate their own reforms. Outside interference\non the question of reform can only result in disrupting\nand stalling processes that are already under way.\nFor reforms to be effective and lasting, they\nshould reflect the actual needs of the societies\nconcerned and should conform with a given State\u2019s\nstage of development. Of course, there is much that the\nadvanced countries can do to help in this process,\nespecially in the areas of investment, trade\nliberalization, international economic cooperation and\nthe opening of their markets. We believe that removing\nprotective measures, such as trade barriers and tariffs,\nand eliminating preferential treatment that hinders the\nability of developing countries to enter the markets of\ndeveloped countries can go far in achieving desired\ndevelopment goals. There is, moreover, a need to make\nthe necessary effort to help those countries to\novercome their problems and their chronic political\nconflicts.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, based on its\nposition of responsibility and its effective role in the\ninternational oil market, has consistently sought to\nmeet its obligations to maintain stable oil markets and\nensure continuing world economic growth. To that end,\nit has increased its production capacity to ensure\nsufficient supply and to control unnatural oil price\nsurges.\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took\nthe initiative of establishing the International Energy\nForum and hosting its general secretariat in Riyadh.\nThe Forum has become a platform for discussing ways\nand means of cooperation and dialogue between\nconsumer and producer countries, whether within or\noutside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC). Those countries should seek to\nintensify their cooperation in order to ensure stable\nmarkets for the strategic commodity of petroleum, and\nto guarantee the continued growth of the global\neconomy.\nIn view of the tragic security events on the\ninternational scene, the world needs, more than ever,\nconcerted international efforts to increase dialogue and\nraise the level of understanding, mutual contact and\nfamiliarity among nations and cultures. The world\nneeds to embark on a serious effort to propagate a\nculture of peace, in order to achieve for our fellow\nhuman beings the dignity and prosperity they deserve.\nWe need to do more to put an end to the wave of\nviolence and work for the achievement of justice and\nthe termination of racial discrimination.\nGod Almighty said in the Holy Qur\u2019an: \u201cO\nmankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male\nand a female, And made you into Nations and tribes,\nthat ye may know each other. Verily the most honoured\nof you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most\nrighteous of you.\u201d"

        "file_text": "Through the founding\nof the United Nations almost 60 years ago, humankind\nraised its mutual cooperation to an entirely new level.\n31\n\nPrior to that, humankind painfully came to realize,\nthrough a catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions, the\ninseparable link between its fate and the urgent need\nfor international cooperation.\nToday the fate of humankind is even more\ncrucially linked than ever before. The boundaries\nbetween the problems of \u201cothers\u201d and \u201cour\u201d problems\nare being increasingly erased. This applies to a wide\nrange of areas: from security and social welfare to the\neconomy and the environment. For this reason, world\nproblems demand solidarity and the additional\ncommitment of the international community to help\nthose in need and to ensure that everyone will share in\nthe fruits of technological progress. In this spirit,\nSlovenia supports the report of the World Commission\non the Social Dimension of Globalization and its\nemphasis on the urgent need to ensure the conditions\nfor a just and fair globalization.\nThe Millennium Goals represent a major\ncommitment to resolving problems of the modern\nworld. But the developmental goals for bridging the\ngap between rich and poor are not being realized to a\nsatisfactory extent. Existing international mechanisms\nand institutions are not ensuring that the trends of\nincreasing global imbalance can be turned around for\nthe better. We need change that will break through the\ninertia of established systems of operation. And for this\nwe need new approaches: introducing innovative\nsources of financing world development can be one\nsuch approach. It is time for us to realize the urgent\nneed for change in world relations, and to summon the\nnecessary will to put these changes into effect and\nthereby raise international cooperation to a new level.\nThe past year was again marked by international\nterrorism, which claimed countless innocent lives. We\nwitnessed with pain the tragedies in Beslan, Moscow,\nMadrid, Istanbul, Riyadh, Haifa and elsewhere.\nInternational terrorism is erasing the boundary between\npeace and war. The common fight against international\nterrorism and its origins must remain one of the\npriority tasks of individual Members and of the entire\nUnited Nations. This also applies to preventing the\nspread of weapons of mass destruction. The unanimous\nSecurity Council resolution is a welcome step towards\neffective cooperation in this area.\nWhen we combat the universal evil of terrorism,\nwe should not do this at the expense of the existing\nlegal standards of human rights and international\nhumanitarian law. Any lowering of these standards will\nbe repaid to us in a reduction of the legitimacy of\ninternational action \u2014 and consequently in a creation\nof fertile ground for further attacks on human security.\nWe should also draw attention to the\nresponsibility of countries, in accordance with the\nprinciples of good governance, to ensure for their\ncitizens the necessary conditions for a secure and\ndecent life.\nIn that context, we must express our concern at\nthe humanitarian situation in Darfur, and we welcome\nthe efforts of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to seek a way out of the crisis.\nThe increasingly direct contacts among cultures\nand civilizations bring new challenges and new\nopportunities. Let us exploit them for mutual\nenrichment and the formulation of a common\nconsciousness of humankind. We will be able to do that\nonly with the presumption of radical equality and the\ntolerant acceptance of plurality in human values. The\nboundaries of the plurality of those values are\ndelineated by fundamental human rights and freedoms.\nThe United Nations plays a central part in asserting\nthem internationally.\nSlovenia welcomes the start of work by the new\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour,\nand assures her of our full willingness to cooperate. At\nthe same time, we express our continued support of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which represents an\nimportant instrument for the exercise of the rule of law\nand human rights.\nOnly a multilateral response to modern\nchallenges can be effective. Of all existing\norganizations, the United Nations is without doubt the\nmost important and most appropriate for seeking such\nresponses. However, it is in need of institutional\nreform, so that its structure \u2014 the structure of 60 years\nago \u2014 can now better reflect the realities of today\u2019s\nworld. Solutions to the burning issues facing\nhumankind must be sought within the United Nations\nsystem, otherwise solutions will be imposed outside it.\nFrequently, that will undoubtedly be to the detriment of\nhuman development.\nSlovenia supports the efforts to revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly and acknowledges the achievements\nof Julian Hunte, President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-eighth session, in that area. We eagerly await\n32\n\nthe report of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change at the end of the year, and we\nexpress our willingness to cooperate fully. We hope\nthat, on the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nwe will see such changes, which will ensure for this\nglobal Organization a central place and the greatest\npossible effectiveness in performing its mission.\nIncreasingly, threats to international peace and\nsecurity are taking on new forms, which for a long time\nnow have not been limited to the danger of aggression\nby one country against another. They cover a whole\nrange of internal tensions and conflicts within\ncountries, on the one hand, and transboundary threats\nsuch as international terrorism, environmental\npollution and the asymmetrical effects of globalization,\non the other. In modern threats to international peace\nand security, States are not the only players. For that\nreason alone, States cannot on their own provide a\nsatisfactory response to them.\nIntergovernmental cooperation needs to be\nsupplemented through the inclusion of various non-\ngovernmental organizations and global civil society.\nI would like also to highlight the responsibility\nand potential of transnational corporations to\ncontribute to protecting the environment and to\neliminating the tensions caused by global competitive\nmodels. Non-governmental organizations can\ncontribute to solutions through innovative approaches\nand by going beyond the limitations of established\nbureaucratic frameworks. They can help to create a\ncritical mass of awareness regarding the urgent need\nfor change and the elimination of global imbalances.\nBy incorporating the contribution of various segments\nof global society into the work of the United Nations,\nwe will make it more sensitive to the actual problems\nof people in various parts of the world.\nIn that context, we welcome the report of the\nPanel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-Civil\nSociety Relations, since it sets out a range of useful\nproposals regarding the contribution of non-\ngovernmental actors.\nThe complexity of modern threats to world peace\nand security also require a strengthening of the\ncooperation between various regional organizations\nand the United Nations. In this respect, we welcome\nthe open debate in the Security Council on this subject.\nSuch cooperation is especially welcome in cases where\nregional intervention can be more rapid and effective\nin conflict prevention and in post-conflict peace-\nbuilding.\nNext year Slovenia will assume the presidency of\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope, and in that capacity as well we will strive for a\nfurther intensification of the good cooperation between\nthe two organizations.\nIn that spirit, the European Union is assuming\nincreasing responsibility for stabilization and progress\nin the countries of south-eastern Europe. In the past\nyear we have witnessed major progress on the part of\nthe countries in the region. However, in some areas we\nalso saw a resurgence of the dangers created by still-\nunresolved inter-ethnic issues and a lack of socio-\neconomic prospects.\nThe goal of attaining democratic standards,\nincluding in the areas of human rights and the\nprotection of minorities, must remain at the centre of\nour efforts. At the same time, however, we have to note\nthat certain unresolved status questions hamper the\npolitical and economic consolidation of the region. We\nwill thus have to devote greater attention to resolving\nthose questions.\nGlobalization is erasing geographical boundaries\nand reducing the physical distances between people. At\nthe same time, however, it is increasing the differences\nbetween rich and poor \u2014 between those who are\nsharing in the positive effects of globalization and\nthose who are being pushed even further to the\nmargins. Frequently we forget that not even those who\nderive the greatest benefit from globalization can\nprotect themselves from its negative effects. Not even\nthe richest and most technically advanced of us can\nisolate ourselves from international terrorism or from\nthe effects of climate change and extreme poverty.\nFor that reason, our common commitment and\nresponsibility must be to ensure that all people benefit\nfrom the positive effects of globalization, and that,\nthrough our joint efforts, we ensure the protection of\nthe environment. We can achieve this only through the\nbroadest possible partnership and solidarity. There are\nmore than enough signals that it is now high time for\ncoordinated international action."

        "file_text": "Allow me to express my\nsincere thanks to the President of the General\nAssembly at its previous session, Julian Hunte, whose\nable and skilful leadership we enjoyed during the past\nsession. I also wish the President at the fifty-ninth\nsession, Jean Ping, a year of highly constructive and\nsuccessful work.\nIt is our common duty to make this fifty-ninth\nsession a success and a fitting preparation for the\nsixtieth anniversary of the United Nations and the first\nhigh-level review of the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration, to be held next year. I believe\nthese two occasions will offer an excellent framework\nfor a serious review of how the changing global\nsituation can be met by a renewed United Nations.\nThe risks and challenges of the new millennium\naffect us all and can be tackled only by common\nefforts. Threats such as terrorism recognize no borders,\nno differentiation by race, religion, or ethnicity. The\nhorror, devastation and fear that terrorism brings are\n31\n\nthe same whether in Casablanca, Madrid, New York,\nJerusalem or Beslan. Terrorism cannot be justified.\nAnd there can be no excuses and no leniency in\nconfronting it. The fight against terrorism must remain\none of the priority tasks of individual Member States\nand of the United Nations.\nEven as we speak, humanitarian crises, poverty,\nfamine and disease continue to plague large parts of the\nworld. Across the globe, almost a billion people\nsurvive on less than a dollar a day. In sub-Saharan\nAfrica alone, around 300 million people live in abject\npoverty.\nIn Iraq, the hope for universal and free elections\nis marred by almost daily explosions, and security\nremains too precarious for the United Nations to\nresume its pivotal role. The Middle East conflict\ncontinues taking its desperate death toll. And the word\ngenocide is once again on our lips owing to the Darfur\ncrisis in Sudan.\nTherefore, we need to go the extra mile, to make\nextra efforts to empower the United Nations to deal\nsuccessfully with these and other threats and\nchallenges, because the United Nations, despite all the\ncriticism, remains the only Organization capable of\nembodying the principles of a truly global and\neffective multilateralism. The United Nations can offer\nthe global reach and legitimacy necessary to enable the\ninternational community to act.\nAs the nature of threats before us is changing and\nnew responses are needed, it is high time to agree on\nfuture policies and principles. Today we need to build a\nshared understanding of the nature of modern threats to\ninternational peace and security. Much depends on the\nability of the United Nations \u2014 that is, on us \u2014 to\nreach a new consensus on collective security. Our\nstrength lies in our resolve to deal collectively with\nmajor challenges to peace, security and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nToday, more than ever before, the United Nations\nhas to play the leading role in building societies that\nfollow the path of good governance, respect human\nrights and the rule of law. We must be able to intervene\nand to prevent situations of massive human rights\nviolations.\nWe must also be firm in our struggle against all\nattempts to encroach upon human dignity, against all\nforms and manifestations of intolerance, anti-Semitism,\nracism or Islamophobia. The international community\nis vulnerable to the dangers posed by the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, international\norganized crime, environmental degradation and the\nspread of highly dangerous diseases, such as\nHIV/AIDS. Our common efforts against these and\nother threats must be universal, consistent, systematic\nand unwavering.\nNo less universal and consistent must be our\nefforts to reduce poverty and hunger, to diminish\ndisparities between and within nations, to improve\nliving conditions for women and children and to offer a\nhope of a dignified life to ever-larger segments of the\nworld\u2019s population, as pledged in the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nWe need to press ahead with the implementation\nof the Millennium Development Goals. We need to\nreinforce our political will to make our global\npartnership more effective, by fully honouring the\ncommitments undertaken by the Monterrey Consensus.\nWithout peace there is no development. Without\ndevelopment there is no peace. This recognized linkage\nof security and development should be better reflected\nin our global agenda. Only by confronting these issues\nin a coherent and coordinated manner shall we be able\nto build our common future.\nLithuania is ready to contribute bilaterally and\nmultilaterally to the implementation of the Millennium\nGoals, and by sharing our experience of a national\nreform process. Our membership in the enlarged\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Alliance\nenables us to play a more active role by embracing the\nprinciples of development policy and by adopting the\nrole of a donor.\nNext year we will discuss how to find consensus\non the institutional and political framework for the\nUnited Nations to operate in the future. Lithuania fully\nembraces the need for reform of the United Nations for\nthe sake of enhancing its effectiveness and\ninclusiveness. We hope that the outcome of the\ndeliberations of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change will be able to contribute\nsignificantly to giving a renewed impetus to the reform\nof the United Nations. If so, the next test will be to find\nbroad agreement on changes and follow their\nimplementation.\n32\n\nI hope, too, that next year will be crucial in\nmoving ahead with the long-debated reform of the\nSecurity Council. The issue is not whether the Security\nCouncil should be enlarged. It is how to make it\neffective and representative. Therefore, Lithuania fully\nembraces the idea of ensuring broader representation\nand responsibility for the Security Council.\nIn addition, the Economic and Social Council\nmust be renewed and strengthened. By dedicating\nourselves to Economic and Social Council reform we\nhave a real chance to make it an effective tool in the\nhands of active and responsible United Nations\nmembers.\nIt is my hope and wish that by the end of this\nsession we shall arrive at marking the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations with the conviction\nand satisfaction that we have done everything in our\npower to build a better Organization, one capable of\nresponding to both old and new, hard and soft, threats\nand challenges in an effective and comprehensive way.\nFully aware that the United Nations was created\nto serve humankind, let us embrace this challenge. Let\nus bring to fruition the promise that the United Nations\nis capable of fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the\npeoples for whom it was created."

        "file_text": "My delegation, Sir, is delighted at seeing you presiding\nover this session of the General Assembly. We also\nwish to state the high esteem in which we hold the past\nPresident, Mr. Julian Hunte, of Saint Lucia, and for\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan.\nThe Seychelles, a small island country, is defined\nby the fact that it belongs to two regions \u2014 the Indian\nOcean and the African continent \u2014 and by the fact that\nit belongs to several linguistic and cultural areas.\nToday we wish to be an example of cohabitation of\nman and nature and an example of unity and cohesion\nwith our people. These two objectives are at the heart\nof our development plans.\nIn April of this year, Mr. James Michel succeeded\nMr. Albert Rene in the presidency of the Republic\nthrough a calm and proper political transition. The new\nPresident defends the same development philosophy,\ntaking into account, of course, changes on the world\nscene, and the economic needs that are inherent in\nstarting a new phase of our development. Thus, the\nPresident has assessed our difficulties and the options\navailable to us in different areas of our economy, such\nas the balance of payments, the debt burden, access\nunder reasonable terms to capital \u2014 and in this context\nwe are a middle-income country \u2014 access to markets,\nand so forth.\nTogether with the Bretton Woods institutions and\nour other customary partners, we have committed\nourselves to a progressive programme of adjustment\nand of giving new dynamics to our economy. Of\ncourse, we are progressing at our own pace, because\nwe remain a vulnerable economy, since we are a small\nisland country, isolated from markets.\nI would like to say a few words about the\nSeychelles\u2019 commitment to the international\ncommunity. First of all, on the question of security, the\nfight against terrorism, money laundering and drug\ntrafficking are, in the Seychelles, subjects of\nprevention and deterrence. We are taking action to\ntackle the causes, the methods and the effects of these\ncriminal actions. The Seychelles has ratified all\ninternational conventions on drug trafficking, and we\nsupport all United Nations resolutions on the\nprevention and suppression of the financing of terrorist\nacts.\nWe support the recommendations of the Financial\nAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and\nthe requirements of the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).\n2\n\nWe have enacted a law this year on the prevention\nof terrorism, and at the present time we are revising\nexisting legislation on financial institutions and on\nmoney laundering. I might add that our offshore sector\nis also being monitored in the framework of the\nimplementation of a law on the provision of services\nwhich was promulgated last year.\nWe are fully committed to the fight for security\nand stability. However, it is being done in difficult\nconditions, because the very questionable criterion of\ngross domestic product per capita blocks our access to\nmost development assistance programmes.\nA small and vulnerable State always attaches\nmore importance to recognition of its own identity and\nthe defence of its stability. We, therefore, unreservedly\nsupport the principles and objectives of global peace,\nsecurity and development that are embodied by the\nUnited Nations. We want the Organization to remain\nextremely active in its initiatives to restore peace,\nparticularly in the Middle East and in Africa, to all\nareas where conflicts today have become chronic and\nare steadily worsening.\nWe hope that the reorganization of the United\nNations, which is now under way, will make it possible\nfor it to be repositioned, on the basis of concrete\nactions and follow-up and monitoring mechanisms. We\nbelieve that the Security Council must be open to more\npermanent and non-permanent members, so that the\ndeveloped and developing countries of Africa, Asia\nand Latin America can contribute to the Council\u2019s\ndynamics.\nMore than ever, a genuine North-South dialogue\nis essential to resolve conflicts and to seek shared\nsolutions to shared problems posed by AIDS, poverty,\ndebt and terrorism \u2014 all threats that require a joint\nresponse and shared responsibilities. This dialogue\nrequires new ethics and a new approach to\ndevelopment, which revitalizes international relations\nand corrects injustices. It is particularly important to\ndeal with the roots of the debt problem and to adopt\nenergetic measures in order to assist those States whose\ndevelopment is stymied by this burden.\nWe welcome the exchanges between the Group of\nEight and the developing countries. This is a\nnegotiating platform that should have brought about\nconcrete action and implementation of the\nrecommendations of the Millennium Summit, and\nthose of Monterrey, Johannesburg and Doha. It is\nparticularly important that the allocation by the\ndeveloped countries of 0.7 per cent of their gross\nnational product to international development should\nbe seen and accepted as a realistic and fair objective.\nWe expect the meeting to be held in Mauritius at\nthe beginning of 2005, ten years after the adoption of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action, to produce an\nuncompromising assessment of the Programme\u2019s\nimplementation and to adopt operational measures and\nmechanisms. We are counting on the active\ncommitment of our partners for that assessment and its\nfollow-up.\nSupport and commitment should be expressed in\nthe area of international trade through equitable\ntreatment towards developing countries that have\nstructural weaknesses, such as small island developing\nStates. Such arrangements must take into account the\ndelicate issues of access to markets and trade relations.\nThe goal is to prevent our countries from becoming\nfurther marginalized in a system that claims to be in\nthe interest of all. That is why we invite the World\nTrade Organization to adopt an approach to\ndevelopment that is consistent with the developments\nof recent years. I am referring to the launch of the\nDoha round, devoted explicitly to development, and to\nthe assertion of an African voice on sensitive issues\nsuch as commodities and raw materials. The new trade\nrelations must also enable developing countries to\ncontinue to acquire the means to be more competitive.\nAnother urgent matter for us, the countries most\nvulnerable to the consequences of global warming, is\nthe ratification by all developed countries of the Kyoto\nProtocol. It is the only instrument capable of acting\neffectively with respect to a danger of concern to all.\nWe believe that a special fund should be\nestablished in the United Nations to help fragile\neconomies confront losses, including loss of income,\ncaused by climate change.\nI reaffirm the importance we attach to the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD)\nbecause it is one of the best tools for enabling African\ncountries to manage their own development. We\nappreciate the commitment of the Group of Eight in\nthis regard through its African Action Plan, and it is\nour heartfelt hope that NEPAD\u2019s development agenda\nwill comprehensively address the specific needs of the\neight African island States.\n3\n\nAll these questions are of capital importance\ntoday. We hope that the British presidency of the\nGroup of Eight in 2005 and the United Nations summit\nto review the Millennium Development Goals, also\nscheduled for 2005, will work a very clear rebalancing\nin favour of our countries.\nSeychelles reaffirms its support for the General\nAssembly, and we thank you, Mr. President, for your\npersonal action. We also thank Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan. My country is an advocate of the cause of\ndevelopment, which is a fundamental right. That right\nentails the obligation of political solidarity in the most\nactive sense of the term."

        "file_text": "Allow me to join previous speakers in congratulating\nyou on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\nninth session of the General Assembly.\nThe world of the twenty-first century faces a\nparadox. It is unified globally in the areas of\nproduction, such as trade, finance and in the digital\nrevolution of information and communication\ntechnology - yet it is divided by the increase in\nconflicts, civil strife and transnational terrorism, as\nwell as cultural and ethnic violence. The world is\nunified by universal values, such as democracy, human\nrights and respect for freedom of expression and the\nenvironment - yet it is divided when democracy\nclashes with social demands for more jobs and less\nhunger.\nThose contradictory trends of globalization and\nfragmentation jeopardize governance not only at the\ninternational level, but also within nations. Conflicts\nsharpen; many poor States are rocked by domestic and\nexternal violence; terrorist organizations and traffickers\nin drugs, weapons and persons are emerging and\namassing devastating global power.\nSince the end of the cold war, more than 30 civil\nconflicts have caused approximately 5 million deaths\nand created almost 17 million refugees. In 2004, the\nUnited Nations has been administering 15\npeacekeeping operations and 15 special political\nmissions. That means that 16 per cent of Member\nStates are affected by issues undermining peace and\ninternational security.\nIn a context in which no single Power can assure\nglobal governance, in a world where fragmentation\nabets nuclear threats, both nations and peoples demand\nurgent decisions \u00f3 decisions ensuring global\ngovernance based on international law, increased\nrespect for the United Nations, within a renewed and\nstrengthened multilateralism, and the reinforcement of\nthe values of peace and international justice.\nIn the global era, the world requires broad\nconsensus. Peru considers that the best solution is to be\nfound through both change and continuity. We must\nstabilize the world political situation and generate an\ninternational alliance for development and social\njustice. We call for continuity in order to attain the\ngoals of the United Nations. We call for peace,\nsecurity, juridical equality of States, the non-use of\nforce, the prohibition of aggression, the international\nrule of law governing relations among States,\ninternational cooperation, economic and social\ndevelopment and respect for human rights \u00f3 all of\nwhich are more necessary and have more validity today\nthan ever before.\nWe also propose a change of tools, mechanisms\nand measures. The reform of the Security Council must\nbe tackled realistically, bearing in mind its role as a\nmechanism for collective security for the international\ncommunity as a whole. The people want a Security\nCouncil with guarantees of legitimate and effective\ndecisions.\n5\n\nPeru is a country whose diplomatic tradition,\nsince the nineteenth century, has supported\nmultilateralism as the best means for international\ndecisions, particularly to promote peace and\ndevelopment. Peru participates in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. My country is contributing\nmilitary troops in Cyprus, on the border between\nEthiopia and Eritrea and in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, and we are participating in Liberia and in\nC\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire. Recently, my Government decided to\nsend a fully equipped company to help achieve\nstability, security and the reinstitutionalization of\ndemocracy in the Republic of Haiti.\nAs a result of our long-standing participation in\nmaintaining peace and security and in promoting\ndevelopment, Peru has announced its candidacy for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council during the\nperiod 2006-2007. We are grateful for the considerable\nsupport that we have received and for the favourable\nconsideration given to our candidacy.\nToday, 2.8 billion people live on $2 per day; 1.3\nbillion people subsist on $1 per day. Moreover, in the\n1990s, social inequality became more pronounced\nthroughout the world. According to the Worldwatch\nInstitute, that increase in inequality affected not only\npersonal incomes, but also access to water, food and\nenergy \u00f3 public goods essential for civilized life and\nsocio-political stability. Today, the decrease in personal\nincomes and the increase in inequality are colliding\nlike tectonic plates, producing tremors of social\ndisintegration and international conflict.\nTherefore, we in the international community\nmust understand that the peace, security and stability\nof the world system are not related solely to political,\nmilitary or strategic aspects. Peace and security have\nsocial and economic components. Poverty and\nexclusion militate against peace, security and\ndemocracy. Social exclusion produces violence,\ninstability and national and international fragmentation\nand renders democracy fragile. We cannot overcome\nthat situation if we do not cause globalization to have a\nhuman face and to become a positive force that\nprovides tangible benefits to all nations and all human\nbeings.\nThe rule of law and the international legal order\nmust guarantee access to justice and respect for human\nrights. The rule of law must prevent impunity. At the\nsame time, democratic societies must make\ntransparency and the fight against corruption true\npolicies of the State.\nPeru, before the process of recovering its\ndemocracy, was captive to corruption, systematic\nhuman rights violations and the subjugation of justice\nto political power. The corrupt and authoritarian\nGovernment hijacked democracy, tortured\nsystematically and made corruption a tool of political\npower. Today, the free consciences of Peru demand that\nthose responsible be brought to justice. Therefore, I\nappeal to the Government of Japan to contribute to\naccess to justice by authorizing the extradition of\nformer President Alberto Fujimori for the crimes\nagainst humanity with which Peruvian justice has\ncharged him, including his alleged responsibility for\nacts of torture, forced disappearances, summary\nexecutions and acts of corruption. Democratic Peru\nguarantees a fair trial and due process under the rule of\nlaw. I make this appeal in the conviction that the rule\nof law and the international legal order must guarantee\naccess to justice. To deny such access is tantamount to\nenshrining impunity, and I am sure that the\ninternational order is not prepared to consider itself an\naccomplice to such impunity. We hope that that will\nnot happen."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating you, Mr. Ping, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly during its fifty-\nninth session. We are confident that you will conduct\nthe proceedings of this session with great competence.\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian Robert Hunte, who so ably presided over the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nI would like to express at this time my deep\nappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General to\nharmonize international relations and ensure respect\nfor the principles of the Charter and international law,\nwith a view to strengthening international peace and\nsecurity. His statement before this Assembly marks a\n26\n\nlandmark in the quest for the rule of law and respect\nfor the role of the United Nations in international\nconflicts.\nIn my statement, I will focus on the turbulent\nsituation in the Middle East and, more specifically, on\nthe core of the conflict in the Middle East. The\nsituation in the region of Western Asia \u2014 or the\nMiddle East \u2014 is in turmoil. The occupation of Iraq\nwas founded on false pretexts, further damaging the\nalready grave situation resulting from Israel\u2019s policies\nand practices in occupied Palestinian and other Arab\nterritories. A total absence of law and order is now the\ngeneral pattern of life in occupied Iraq. This continued\noccupation is wreaking havoc on the economic and\nsocial aspects of life there. We urge the competent\ninstitutions, namely the United Nations General\nAssembly and the Security Council, to take the\nnecessary and appropriate measures to ensure Iraq\u2019s\nindependence and sovereignty as soon as possible.\nIsrael is the only nuclear Power in the Middle\nEast. It has approximately the fourth most powerful\narmy in the world and is a sophisticated arms\ndeveloper and dealer with no ethical or moral\nconstraints and no concern for human rights. The\nIsraeli Government can therefore do anything it\nwishes, and it acts like a high-tech military expert and\nrogue State. It has become tremendously useful for the\nUnited States, since it has strategically placed itself in\nthe centre of the global arms industry. Counting on the\nsupport of the United States, Israel breaks moral and\ninternational laws with impunity.\nThe daily assaults on peaceful Palestinian towns\nand villages \u2014 the demolition of homes and houses,\nthe bulldozing and uprooting of age-old fruit-bearing\nolive and citrus trees, the targeted killings and\nassassinations, the closures, the imposition of a state of\nsiege and curfews and the use of excessively\ndisproportionate firepower, which has resulted, so far,\nin more than 3,200 deaths and thousands of injuries \u2014\nare common knowledge. We completely reject the\nallegation by Israel that this is carried out in self-\ndefence. The Palestinians under occupation, with their\nmeagre means of combat, are the party exercising the\nright to self-defence. Almost 8,000 Palestinians are\nbeing held without trial under merciless conditions,\nand when they protested against those conditions, an\nIsraeli minister boasted, and I quote, \u201clet them go on a\nhunger strike until they die\u201d.\nIn addition to all the other methods Israel uses to\nobstruct peace, it holds our democratically elected\nPresident, Yasser Arafat, in confinement and has\nannounced that they can find no partner with whom to\nnegotiate peace. With whom are the negotiations for\nsettlement and peace to be negotiated, if not with the\ndemocratically elected President? Israel, and others of\nthe same mind, must wish to see a continuation of the\nstatus quo or to deal with an imposed \u2014 and not\ndemocratically elected \u2014 group or person.\nThe performance-based road map was\nunanimously backed by Security Council resolution\n1515 (2003). We have accepted the road map since, in\nour opinion, it augured well. The road map envisaged a\ntwo-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\nand stated that the solution of the conflict\n\u201cwill only be achieved through an end to violence\nand terrorism, when the Palestinian people have a\nleadership acting decisively against terror and\nwilling and able to build a practising democracy\nbased on tolerance and liberty, and through\nIsrael\u2019s readiness to do what is necessary for a\ndemocratic Palestinian state to be established\u201d.\nThe Palestinians, through their representative, the\nPalestine Liberation Organization, embraced the road\nmap and believes it offers another opportunity to end\nthe conflict. We hope that the Quartet will seriously\nassume the noble task of implementing the objectives\nof the road map.\nActs of State terrorism were Israel\u2019s response to\nthe performance-based road map. To be more specific,\na 2,000-pound bomb was dropped after the Palestinians\nscrupulously observed an unofficial ceasefire. Israel\nstill adheres to the 14 reservations it had regarding the\nroad map. The nebulous ideas and intentions revealed\nin the exchange of letters between President Bush and\nPrime Minister Sharon on the matter of the\ncommitment to the road map are far from encouraging\nand keep the road map and Security Council resolution\n1515 (2003) in limbo if not completely neglecting and\nrejecting them.\nIn his letter of assurance dated 14 April 2004 to\nPrime Minister Sharon, President Bush reiterates that\n\u201cthe United States supports the establishment of a\nPalestinian state that is viable, contiguous,\nsovereign, and independent, so that the\nPalestinian people can build their own future in\n27\n\naccordance with \u2026 the path set forth in the\nroadmap\u201d.\nHowever, when President Bush addresses the\nreality on the ground, he assures Israel that \u201cit is\nunrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status\nnegotiations will be a full and complete return to the\narmistice lines of 1949\u201d.\nHe admits that as part of a final peace settlement,\nIsrael must have secure and recognized borders, which\nshould emerge from negotiations between the parties in\naccordance with United Nations Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). However,\nMr. Bush and Mr. Sharon do not topographically\nidentify the secure and recognized borders of Israel.\nIn the aforementioned letter of assurance,\nPresident Bush stresses that the United States is\nstrongly committed to Israel\u2019s security and well-being\nas a Jewish State. He does not concern himself with the\nsecurity of the so-called provisional State of Palestine.\nHe seems to be oblivious to the fact that 20 per cent of\nthe citizens of Israel are non-Jewish and that Israel has\nnot as yet defined who is a Jew. This concept will\ninevitably lead to the creation of a racist society within\nthe Israeli political entity.\nTo ensure the success of the road map and the\nachievement of its goal \u2014 a final and comprehensive\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 2005 \u2014\nthe plan also requires that Israel \u201cfreezes all settlement\nactivity\u201d and \u201cwithdraws from Palestinian areas\noccupied from 28 September 2000\u201d.\nCommenting on the meeting between\nPresident Bush and Prime Minister Sharon,\nJavier Solana, European Union High Representative for\nthe Common Foreign and Security Policy, stated on\n15 April 2004:\n\u201cThe EU remains firmly committed to a\nnegotiated settlement resulting in two viable,\nsovereign and independent States \u2026 as the only\nway to achieve a permanent peace and an end to\nthe occupation that began in 1967, in the\nframework of a comprehensive peace in the\nMiddle East.\n\u201cEU heads of State or Government recently\nindicated that they would not recognize any\nchange to the pre-1967 borders other than those\narrived at by agreement between the parties. A\npermanent settlement must also include an\nagreed, just, fair and realistic solution to the\nrefugee issue\u201d.\nIn order further to deviate from the direct route to\nthe targeted destination, Sharon declared that he was\nabsolutely determined to carry out disengagement in\nGaza despite the political problems within his own\nparty, the Likud. Indeed, the party believes that\ndisengagement conflicts with the Zionist aim of the\ncreeping annexation of Palestinian territory. Sharon\u2019s\nplan creates a situation in which Israel will have to\nleave the settlements but will still control everything\nthat enters and exits Gaza. It will tightly seal off Gaza\nand block the only outlet that allows Palestinians in\nGaza to cross into and from neighbouring Egypt.\nAll of this is a source of concern for the\ninternational community, as reflected in the number of\nmeetings held by the General Assembly. Israel did not\nheed the request by the Assembly in resolution\nES-10/14, which, by necessity, called for an advisory\nopinion by the International Court of Justice on the\nfollowing question:\n\u201cWhat are the legal consequences arising\nfrom the construction of the wall being built by\nIsrael, the occupying Power, in the occupied\nPalestinian territory, including in and around East\nJerusalem, as described in the report of the\nSecretary-General, considering the rules and\nprinciples of international law, including the\nFourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant\nSecurity Council and General Assembly\nresolutions?\u201d\nThe General Assembly, by an overwhelming\nmajority of 150 votes, acknowledged the Court\u2019s\nadvisory opinion of 9 July 2004. The representatives of\nthe Governments of the United States of America and\nof Israel were among the six countries that voted\nagainst.\nI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to\nexpress our great appreciation for the learned opinion\nof the judges. I wish to quote from the opinion, as it is\nof direct relevance to the General Assembly:\n\u201cAll States are under an obligation not to\nrecognize the illegal situation resulting from the\nconstruction of the wall and not to render aid or\nassistance in maintaining the situation created by\nsuch construction;\n28\n\n\u201c\u2026 The United Nations, and especially the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council,\nshould consider what further action is required to\nbring to an end the illegal situation resulting from\nthe construction of the wall and the associated\nregime, taking due account of the present\nadvisory opinion.\u201d\nIn order to restore faith and confidence in the\neffectiveness of the United Nations and its Charter, I\nwould appeal that the opinion of the Court be heeded\nand that action-oriented resolutions, including concrete\nmechanisms for implementation, be adopted and\ncarried out.\nThe Palestinian people and leadership have\ndemonstrated goodwill and accepted in good faith the\nprovisions of the road map and other proposals leading\nto the termination of the Israeli occupation of our\nPalestinian territory, so that we in the Middle East can\nall live in peace and security and stability. What is\nneeded is for the other party, Israel, to commit itself to\nrespond, in word and in deed."

        "file_text": "In view of\ntime constraints, I shall share an abbreviated version of\nmy speech. The full text is being distributed in the\nHall. Please forgive me for skipping the usual formal\ngreetings to all the deserving dignitaries.\nI first walked into this building in December\n1975, in the midst of a North American winter, having\nnever seen snow in my life, to appear before the\nSecurity Council. I learned then, and since, that not all\nUnited Nations resolutions are implemented. But I also\nlearned that, in spite of its shortcomings and failings,\nthe United Nations offers us hope and that we must\ncling to that hope, for it gives us the strength and the\ncourage to continue.\nWhen the Secretary-General visited Timor-Leste\nin May 2002 to preside over the formal transfer of\nsovereignty to our elected President, I said to him:\n\u201cMr. Secretary-General, you are going to lose your job\nas President of Timor-Leste\u201d. I can assure members\nthat Kofi Annan did not seem too upset to be\nrelinquishing that unpaid and difficult job. We thank\nhim for his wise stewardship of Timor-Leste\u2019s\ntransition to independence.\nWe cannot fail to pay tribute to our beloved\nfriend, Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was brutally\nmurdered in Iraq just over a year ago. Our people wept\nover his death, but Sergio will always live in us. His\npassage through Timor-Leste, his charisma, energy and\nsmile will be with us forever. Our tribute goes also to\nall the United Nations personnel who lost their lives in\nour country and in many other difficult regions around\nthe world.\nWe offer our sincere condolences and solidarity\nto Russia, Spain, Indonesia and Australia \u2014 the latest\nvictims in a seemingly endless catalogue of barbarity\ncommitted by fanatics.\nIt was only a little over two years ago that\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan handed over power to\nour elected President. Since then, we have made real\nprogress in several sectors, such as public\nadministration, education and health. Yet, we are\nfailing in other areas.\nThe most fragile sector of the Administration in\nTimor-Leste is the judiciary. We have very few trained\njudges, prosecutors or lawyers. We are committed to\ncreating a strong and independent judiciary, but that\nachievement is still many years off. We thank those\ncountries that have assisted us in improving our\njudiciary and we implore them to continue their efforts\nfor many years to come.\nOur economy is limping along, although it is\ndoing much better than anticipated. We are confident\nthat in two to three years we will experience strong\neconomic growth as a result of revenues from oil and\ngas, as well as capital investment in public\ninfrastructure, including roads, bridges, ports and\nairports, telecommunications, public housing, health,\nagriculture, fisheries and tourism. We should then be\nable to begin drastically reducing unemployment and\npoverty.\nHere we wish to congratulate the Indonesian\npeople and their leaders for their great experiment in\ndemocracy. Few imagined in 1999 that within only a\nfew years the fourth largest nation in the world \u2014 and\nthe largest Muslim country \u2014 would emerge as a\nvibrant democracy.\nTalks are under way between Australia and\nTimor-Leste to rectify our differing interpretations of\ninternational law and State practice as regards maritime\nboundaries between coastal States. Timor-Leste shares\nthe view of the majority of the international\ncommunity that, where there are overlapping claims\nbetween two coastal States, the principle of\nequidistance should apply.\nAllow me now to address some issues that are of\nconcern to us. In the past 20 years or so, our world has\nbeen the stage for several major conflicts, including the\ninvasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein in the 1980s,\nwhich resulted in the death of over a million people.\nChemical and biological weapons were unleashed on\nboth civilians and combatants. Soon after the end of\nthe Iraq-Iran war, the same regime in Baghdad\nlaunched another invasion, this time against the State\nof Kuwait. Most of us have now relegated the\nCambodian tragedy of the 1970s to a footnote in our\nintellectual memory, but let us not forget the almost\nuniversal indifference of the international community\n16\n\nto the genocide unleashed by the Khmer Rouge in\nCambodia.\nLike many of you, and millions of peace\nmarchers, we are opposed to violence and wars. But we\nmust ask ourselves some troubling questions. Should\nwe oppose the use of force even in the face of genocide\nand ethnic cleansing? In the eternal dilemma of war\nand peace there are pacifists and idealists who oppose\nthe use of force under any circumstances and there are\nthe realists who support the use of force under certain\ncircumstances, namely, if it has been sanctioned by the\nSecurity Council. Those who are absolutely against the\nuse of force have been unable to articulate a better\nstrategy for dealing with the savagery of ethnic\ncleansing and genocide. Patient diplomacy lasts as long\nas it lasts; it might bear fruit, or it might not. Genocide,\nhowever, continues as we can see in the Sudan where\nthousands of our fellow human beings are dying right\nnow.\nIn the tragic case of Cambodia in the 1970s, the\nworld knew that an evil regime was deliberately\npurging the nation and murdering hundreds of\nthousands of innocent human beings. Yet, the Security\nCouncil never even discussed the Khmer Rouge\ngenocide. Around the same time as the Cambodian\ntragedy, genocide was taking place on the African\ncontinent, in Uganda. The Security Council neither\ndebated nor took any action on the situation in Uganda\nunder Idi Amin. It required the moral courage of a\nJulius Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania to\nput an end to Idi Amin\u2019s genocidal rule. We would ask,\nif there had been a lone world leader with the moral\ncourage to order his country\u2019s armed forces to\nintervene in Rwanda in 1994, would he have been\nhailed as a saviour or vilified as an aggressor?\nIn selectively recalling some of the most flagrant\ncases of our collective failure to prevent wars and\ngenocide, our sole intention is to provoke reflection on\nthe failings and weaknesses of the United Nations with\na view to exploring ways of making our Organization a\nmore effective custodian of world peace.\nAllow us to add some thoughts to the ongoing\ndebate as to how we can realize an improved United\nNations. We wish, however, to preface our views on\nUnited Nations reform by stating that we do not\nbelieve that a simple expansion of Security Council\nmembership will suffice to strengthen the United\nNations. It may make the Council more representative\nby better reflecting current global demographics and\npower-balances, but it will not necessarily make it\nmore effective.\nThat said, there is a clear need to expand\nmembership in the Security Council for non-permanent\nand permanent members. Timor-Leste fully supports\nthe Franco-German initiative on United Nations\nreforms. We also believe that the new expanded\nSecurity Council should include countries like\nGermany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil and one or\ntwo from the African continent. But, to reassure you, I\nshould add that Timor-Leste is not seeking a permanent\nseat in the Security Council for itself \u2014 please do not\nworry about that.\nWe particularly support permanent membership\nstatus for Indonesia because we believe in the need for\nbalanced representation within the Security Council,\nencompassing all the world\u2019s major civilizations and\nfaiths. Non-inclusion of Indonesia \u2014 the largest\nsecular Muslim country in the world \u2014 as a new\npermanent member would again leave the Security\nCouncil with a predominantly Christian representation.\nIncidentally, my Government has already\nreceived requests for support for a seat in Council for\nas far ahead as 2020 and 2024. Moreover, on the basis\nof the two-year rotation arrangement, it seems that\nTimor-Leste, and many other small nations, will only\nbe able to offer its services to the Security Council\nsomewhere in 2049. Incidentally, we are very touched\nthat many delegations have already expressed support\nfor Timor-Leste for 2049.\nThe world is faced with a growing AIDS\npandemic, the epicentre of which is now shifting to\nAsia. Moreover, malaria and tuberculosis have been\nwith us for many generations, yet there is no real\ncommitment of resources that will enable our scientists\nand societies to address those epidemics.\nThe combined official development assistance\n(ODA) of the rich industrialized countries does not\nexceed US$ 50 billion annually. Compare that with the\nmore than US$ 300 billion those countries provide in\nsubsidies to their farmers and industries.\nWeapons-producing countries are flooding the\nworld with all types of arms that fuel conflicts. There\nmust be a strict code of conduct on weapons exports\naimed at reducing the flow of conventional weapons to\npoor countries and regions in conflict.\n17\n\nWe in Timor-Leste do not wish to sound\nungrateful, but we have reason to be sceptical about\nODA that ends up back in the donor metropolis with\nonly a fraction of that much-publicized aid benefiting\nthe recipient country. There has to be a thorough\nreform of ODA with a view to ensuring that developing\ncountries actually receive what is pledged. We wonder\nsometimes about the usefulness of the endless\nmeetings, study trips, evaluations, feasibility studies\nand other activities, when, in reality, all the\ninformation required can be downloaded from the\nInternet by a 7-year-old child. Actually my 10-year-old\nniece, Sarah, does most of the Internet searches for me\nand instead of paying an international consultant\nsomething like $1,000 a day in consulting fees, she is\nhappy with two scoops of chocolate ice cream.\nWe join with the leaders of Brazil, Chile, France,\nSpain and others in urging the rich of the North to\nallocate 0.7 per cent of their national wealth to ODA,\nthus meeting the target set by the United Nations. It is\nperplexing that only four small rich countries have met\nand/or exceeded that modest target.\nEurope and the United States should gradually\neliminate all agricultural subsidies to their farmers that\nkill competition and market access of poor countries.\nWe understand the political difficulties faced by some\nfriends in Europe and the United States when dealing\nwith the issue of subsidies. Hence, we believe that\ndeveloping countries, the European Union and the\nUnited States should be able to reach a reasonable\ncompromise on this issue.\nWe conclude our remarks with reference to some\ninternational situations. Regarding the ongoing conflict\nin Western Sahara, we endorse the comments made by\nHis Excellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of\nAlgeria, a country that has contributed enormously to\nthe liberation of the African continent. On this issue,\nour Government is guided by Algeria and the African\nUnion.\nWe appeal to our senior Asian leaders, in\nparticular, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations to redouble\ntheir efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict\nin Myanmar.\nOn the subject of sanctions, we wish to appeal to\nour friends in the United States Congress to rise above\ntheir parochial politics and lift all forms of sanctions\non Cuba.\nThere is deep-seated resentment and anger among\nMuslims and many non-Muslims around the world over\nIsrael\u2019s policies that thwart Palestinian right to a\ndignified existence and homeland.\nThe two-State solution agreed upon by all sides\nhas to be rapidly resurrected and implemented as a first\nstep towards durable peace in the region. The\nPalestinian intifada and suicide-bombing, as well as the\nIsraeli policy of annexation and retaliation, have\ndeepened the anger and hatred. There has to be a way\nout.\nWe hope that the United States, which initiated\nthe war in Iraq and gallantly freed the Iraqi people\nfrom a tyrant, will go half-way and meet those on the\nother side of the debate. The United States and its\nallies should not shoulder the burden of Iraq alone.\nThe Euro-Atlantic partnership is the single most\nimportant pillar of the world\u2019s security and economic\nwell-being. Americans and Europeans share the same\nvalues of democracy and freedom. Surely, they are\nwise enough to overcome their differences, however\ndeep, and give the Iraqi people a chance to finally be\nfree and at peace among themselves and with their\nneighbours. May God Almighty Bless You All."

        "file_text": "Let me first\nof all congratulate you, President Ping, on your\nelection and wish you every success in your\nresponsible post, and express my sincere thanks to the\noutgoing President for his dedicated work.\nI endorse the statement of the Netherlands\nEuropean Union presidency.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the world\nis changing at dramatic speed. In just a few decades,\nhumanity will have reached the 8 billion mark. With\nthe networking of world trade and with global\ncommunication technologies, we are growing ever closer.\nWe are going to become increasingly interdependent in\neconomic, technical and ecological terms.\nAt the same time, we all face a host of new\nchallenges and new dangers which threaten us all \u2014\nthe South and the North, the developing and the\ndeveloped world alike.\nOn the one hand, there are threats to national and\nglobal security such as the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, the nuclear threat, the danger posed\nby failed States or, as we all painfully remember in this\ncity, by terrorism, which does not respect humankind\nor human dignity.\nOn the other hand, there are also so-called soft\nthreats, such as far-reaching environmental and\nclimatic changes, poverty, major shortfalls in education\nand training and the negative aspects of globalization,\nrefugee flows, and diseases and epidemics such as\nHIV/AIDS and malaria. They are a threat to security\nand stability and take a heavy toll.\nThe two \u2014 hard and soft threats \u2014 are closely\nconnected. After all, we know that the causes of war\nand violence, poverty, need and oppression are\nmultifaceted and deep-rooted. We also know that crises\nare the fruit of poverty and a sense of hopelessness,\nand vice-versa. We will have no peace without\ndevelopment, nor indeed development without peace,\nso we have comprehensively to secure peace and\nstability \u2014 above all through economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe States of the world have to work together to\nshape economic, technological and ecological\nglobalization and rise to the resulting challenges. They\nwill not be able to do so without close cooperation.\nIndeed, that is now beyond the tools of traditional\ndiplomacy alone. Their ability to secure and stabilize\nthe international system on their own will in future\nprove less and less adequate.\nWhat we need is a far-reaching reform of the\ninternational system and its institutions that takes due\naccount of these changes. That is a reform we need\nurgently, because we have to create an effective\nmultilateral system which enables us to work together\nto prevent crises and, where that does not work, find\nlong-term solutions.\nThere have already been promising developments\nat the regional level. With their sometimes painful history\nvery much in mind, the States of Europe have joined\ntogether in the European Union and thus have reached\na new level of multilateralism. This political and\neconomic community, now embracing 25 States, has\nbecome an anchor of stability for Europe and beyond.\nSince its foundation the African Union has been\nimpressively shouldering its shared responsibility for\npreventing humanitarian disasters and resolving major\nregional conflicts. This is a courageous and key step\nforward. This breakthrough of multilateralism on the\nAfrican continent will develop an ever more\npronounced dynamism.\nGiven global interdependencies and connections,\nwe need a world organization that has close links to\nthese regional structures and can thus boost the\nefficiency of joint action. The United Nations is the\nmost important forum for setting global rules. Its might\nis the might of the right, as the Secretary-General\nhighlighted in his impressive speech at the opening of\nthis General Assembly session. With its legitimacy we\nhave a unique and universal competence for solving\nproblems together. Since the breaking of the internal\nblockade caused by the cold war, the United Nations\nhas been playing an increasingly significant role. The\ninternational community is making more and more use\nof it as a forum for tackling the major challenges\nfacing humanity.\nFor millions of people today the Blue Flag means\nquite tangible help, often on essential issues, and hope\nfor a better future. For this, we are all very much\nindebted to the Organization and its staff. They are on\nthe ground in many crisis regions in Latin America,\nEurope, Africa and Asia.\nIt is becoming ever clearer that different\napproaches must be found to prevent or resolve each\n17\n\nindividual crisis. The commitment of the United\nNations in all crisis areas is the proof. In Afghanistan\nand in the Balkans, in Haiti and in the Great Lakes\nregion the United Nations is already making a\nconsiderable contribution. But we must realize that\nthere will not be fewer conflicts in the future, and the\ndemands made of the Organization will grow.\nAgainst this backdrop the question arises whether\nthe structures given to the United Nations at its\nfoundation almost sixty years ago are still suited to this\nmandate, whether its work enjoys the international\nacceptance it needs. In particular, the disputes\nconcerning the Iraq crisis highlighted this problem\nonce again.\nWe are convinced there is no alternative to a\nworld acting multilaterally. To make this multilateral\ncooperation sustainable and capable, we need a\ncourageous and comprehensive reform of the United\nNations that faces up to the challenges we are facing.\nIt was the Secretary-General himself who took\nthe initiative, and for this we extend our thanks. To that\nend, he appointed a panel of high-level international\nexperts who are to present him with reform proposals\nat the end of the year. We look forward to that report\nand the ensuing debate with great interest.\nWhat is at stake is a new, shared understanding of\nthe Charter system. How can we shape prevention to\nmake it more effective, and peace-building to make it\nmore sustainable? How can we further implement the\nproposals on the reform of peacekeeping? What exactly\ndo we understand by the right of self-defence? How do\nwe define terrorism? The answer to this question in\nparticular seems clear, yet real agreement would take us,\nthe international community of States, a step forward.\nA number of very concrete proposals on the\nreform of the United Nations institutions have already\nbeen presented. Let me therefore outline some thoughts\non this matter.\nI want to start with the General Assembly. It is\nthe central organ of the United Nations, the only one\nwith universal membership. For this very reason, the\nAssembly has to be more than an annual forum where\nwe just go through the motions. What we need to do\nfirst is focus our topics more carefully. We have to\ndiscuss the truly crucial issues \u2014 otherwise, essential\nquestions will be dealt with in other forums. Secondly,\nwe need more efficient working methods.\nThe Economic and Social Council has to finally\nbecome the central organ in the United Nations system\nfor consultation and decision-making on economic and\nsocial issues. We believe that the Council has at two\nlevels vast potential that has yet to be fully tapped. On\nthe one hand, that body maintains a network of\nexpertise unequalled in the world. We have to make\nbetter and more targeted use of it. On the other hand,\nwe see the Economic and Social Council as a partner\nfor the Security Council for peacekeeping, as laid\ndown in Article 65 of the Charter. When it comes to\nfighting the causes of conflicts and to post-crisis\nrehabilitation, the Economic and Social Council has an\nimportant role to play that can support Security\nCouncil efforts for conflict prevention and peace-\nbuilding. We should grant the Economic and Social\nCouncil more competences in the operative sphere.\nAfter all, the efforts we make in peace missions\nwill be successful only if the military commitment is\nfollowed by a longer phase of stabilization, and very\noften that phase turns out to be the most difficult one.\nThe Economic and Social Council advisory groups on\npost-crisis rehabilitation in Africa are a step in the\nright direction. That is what the decisive link between\nconflict management and development cooperation\ncould indeed look like.\nSuch an all-embracing approach needs\nappropriate financial resources. The instrument of\nvoluntary contributions has proven insufficient in\neveryday life, and therefore I propose earmarking a\ncertain share of the United Nations peacekeeping budget\nfor post-crisis rehabilitation. This means we could\nachieve what we have long been trying, a \u201cprevention\nshare\u201d, which \u2014 let us remember Haiti \u2014 could help\nus save the costs of conflicts flaring up again.\nMany criticize the proliferation of subsidiary and\nsubordinate organizations of the United Nations. Of\ncourse, a reduction cannot be an end in itself. But we\nought to exercise enough self-criticism to ask ourselves\nwhether it would not be better to pool competences in\nsome cases.\nHowever, there are also spheres that need to be\nbetter equipped. I am thinking here, for example, of the\nhandling of environmental issues in the United Nations\nsystem. We thus support the proposal made by French\nPresident Jacques Chirac last year to upgrade the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to a\nspecialized agency with universal membership. That\n18\n\ncould considerably strengthen UNFP\u2019s contribution to\nsustainable development.\nAt the heart of the reform of the United Nations\nis the organ shouldering the central responsibility for\ninternational peace: the Security Council. Conflicts are\non the increase. They stretch across all continents, and\nthey are growing in complexity. In turn, the\nresponsibility and competences of the Council have\nexpanded constantly. Crisis prevention will play an\nincreasingly important role. And for peace-building,\never more comprehensive strategies, closer cooperation\nand additional resources will be needed. This will\nmean more and more decisions that entail long-term\nobligations, create new international law and make\nmajor inroads into State sovereignty.\nIf we really want Security Council decisions to be\naccepted as legitimate and implemented effectively, we\nhave to reform the Council. It has to more broadly\nrepresent a world organization that today embraces\nmore than 191 countries. That is inconceivable without\nincreasing the number of seats \u2014 for permanent and\nnon-permanent members alike. The reasons behind\nsuch a move speak for themselves.\nA Council with more members would enjoy\ngreater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater\nauthority. The more balanced and comprehensive\nrepresentation of all continents \u2014 also among the\npermanent members \u2014 would lead to a better sense of\nownership of the Security Council for all States.\nSimilarly, an enlargement would considerably bolster\nthe motivation of the new Council members to make a\nlong-term contribution to realizing the goals of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe enlargement must adequately reflect sea\nchanges such as decolonization, the end of the cold war\nand globalization. The composition of the Council\nmust ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality.\nThat means that all major regions of the South must be\nrepresented by permanent members in the Security\nCouncil. At the same time, account has to be taken of\nMembers that can and want to make a particularly\nmeaningful and sustainable contribution to maintaining\nworld peace and international security and to realizing\nthe purposes of the Organization. That twofold\napproach would increase the Council\u2019s efficiency and\nits ability to act and to assert itself.\nFor 40 years, the composition of the Security\nCouncil has remained unchanged. I believe it is high\ntime to adapt it to the new global reality. Half-baked or\ninterim solutions are neither necessary nor helpful.\nLike Brazil, India and Japan, Germany too is ready to\ntake on the responsibility associated with a permanent\nseat in the security Council. But it is especially\nimportant to us that the African continent be\nrepresented among the new permanent members.\nA second aspect also has to be taken into account\nin Security Council reform. All in all, a greater number\nof Member States that are engaging themselves in the\nwork of the United Nations should be able to get more\ninvolved in the work of the Security Council. For that\nto happen, additional non-permanent seats also have to\nbe created. That would mean that the balance between\npermanent and non-permanent members could be\nretained.\nAs I said before, United Nations reform will be\nthe central and defining theme of this General\nAssembly session. I thus call upon Member States: let\nus use the fifty-ninth session, right up until the next\nsession in 2005, to launch the overdue reforms and\nachieve tangible results. We, the Member States, have\nto muster the political insight, the will and the\ncreativity to adapt the Organization to the global\nreality. Germany is ready to make a committed\ncontribution."

        "file_text": "I am\naddressing the General Assembly once again, at a time\nwhen the people and the institutions of Colombia are\nmaking great progress in their struggle to achieve\ndemocratic security. Such security would enable all\ncitizens to live in peace, express their political views\nwithout putting their lives in danger and to support or\noppose the Government while fully respecting different\nopinions.\nThat policy has made significant progress in\nreducing murders, kidnappings and other terrorist acts,\nas well as population displacement and the growing of\nillicit drug crops. There is still a great deal to be done,\nbut if we are persistent we will prevail.\nDemocratic security is one of Colombia\u2019s highest\npriorities if we are to regain credibility and if our\ncitizens are once again to have confidence in our\ninstitutions. When trust is destroyed, the ties between\nthe citizen and the nation are broken. Such trust\nrequires transparency in public and private actions, as\nwell as economic revitalization and social cohesion.\nSocial cohesion builds trust among citizens and\nbetween citizens and the State. Social cohesion is the\nenemy of poverty and helps to promote equal\nopportunities. Colombia has established a legal\nframework to ensure that the benefits of economic\ngrowth lead to poverty eradication. Yet Colombia\u2019s\ngrowth, which during the 1960s and 1970s was\naveraging 4.5 per cent a year, fell to an average of 2\nper cent after 1980. That decline encouraged the\ninformal economy, and was accompanied by poverty.\nThe contrast became increasingly obvious between the\nformal private sector \u2014 which was fair with its\nworkers and complied with its tax payments, but which\ngrew at a slow pace \u2014 and the informal sector, which,\nwith its overwhelming influence, drew in the destitute\nmasses.\nDrug trafficking, which bankrolls terrorism,\nreversed the trend towards land distribution, through\nagrarian reform and the natural process of inheritance\nfrom one generation to the next.\nBetween 1994 and 2000, unemployment among\nheads of household grew from 4 per cent to 10 per\ncent, and overall unemployment grew from 7.5 per cent\nto 19 per cent. In relatively few years, the deficit\n2\n\nincreased from 1.5 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the gross\ndomestic product (GDP), public debt rose from 24 per\ncent to 54 per cent of GDP and 40 per cent of the\npublic budget was allocated to debt servicing and\nrepayment. Very low levels of private investment only\nmade the situation worse.\nDefeating poverty requires strong and sustained\neconomic growth. This in turn requires physical and\nlegal security, transparent regulations and\nmacroeconomic stability. Last year, Colombia forecast\ngrowth of 2.5 per cent \u2014 but growth was close to 4 per\ncent. This year we are endeavouring to achieve 5 per\ncent growth. We are able to do because we are\nrestoring confidence among investors. With such\ngrowth, unemployment has fallen three points,\nalthough it is still quite high. A positive sign is that\njobs are being created in sectors that will provide for\nsocial security and fair wages for workers. All that has\nhappened despite fiscal restrictions to public\ninvestment and in the midst of an intense struggle to\neliminate illicit drugs, which have become so\nsignificant that they now affect whether there will be\npositive or negative growth in our agricultural sector.\nAt one time, my generation explained violence as\nthe result of social inequities. My country\u2019s experience\nover many decades allows me to affirm that terrorist\nviolence has increased poverty and has destroyed the\npossibility of eliminating social inequity. Violence has\nworsened poverty and has exploited it to perpetuate\nitself.\nOur goal is to reduce poverty at a rate equal to or\nhigher than economic growth. To a great extent, our\nsocial investment programme depends on sound and\nsustained economic growth. Therefore, our social\ninvestment programme goes hand in hand with our\ndemocratic security policy. If we neglect security\nmeasures that respect democratic values, terrorism will\ngrow, we will lose momentum in defeating it,\ninvestment will be affected, the strength of our\neconomic recovery will weaken and we could be left\nwithout resources for social investment.\nToday\u2019s equality lies in economic and social\nopportunity. That is why we have placed so much\nemphasis on education. We have increased elementary\nschool enrolment by 750,000, but the country still\nneeds classroom space for 1.25 million new pupils. In\n25 months we have increased technical training by two\nand a half times, promoting basic employment skills to\nenable young people to join the work force while\ncontinuing their studies. In the cities and in the\ncountryside, we have been carrying out a silent\nrevolution in technical training that will reach 4\nmillion young people a year by 2006.\nA subsidy is being paid to 340,000 poor families\nto improve their children\u2019s nutrition and ensure school\nattendance. There are now 503,000 children in the new\nbreakfast programme for children under five; that\nnumber will double in 2005. That, together with the\nschool cafeterias and the \u201cCommunity Mothers\u201d\nprogramme, will reach more than 6 million children\nunder various nutrition programmes.\nBy December, when this Administration will\nhave been in office for 28 months, more than 4 million\npoor Colombians will have enrolled in the subsidized\nhealth programme, in addition to the 13 million who\nwere already protected. We are carrying out legal and\nadministrative reforms to increase coverage, with\nimproved transparency and an effective and efficient\nuse of resources.\nColombia has more than 600,000 senior adults\nliving in extreme poverty. In the past, 60,000 of them\nreceived a cash subsidy. This year, we have raised the\nnumber to 172,000 of our elderly compatriots. We are\nnow starting a new programme to deliver one meal a\nday to 400,000 more who do not receive the cash\nsubsidy. In addition, this year we are paying more than\n$100 million in subsidies to provide electricity to low-\nincome members of the population.\nWe are also subsidizing more than 7,000\nreintegrated former members of various violent groups.\nThis is part of a huge, silent, but effective peace\nprocess. When one of those persons is reintegrated, he\nsees the support of the State and the community,\nreconciles himself with civic institutions, embraces\ndemocracy and coexistence and rejects any justification\nfor violence. We hope that many more thousands will\nfollow, but we will require international cooperation\nfor this programme.\nWe are subsidizing 21,000 forest ranger families,\nwho were formerly involved in illicit drug crops and\nare now committed to eliminating them and to\nrecovering their tropical forests. Their task is essential\nfor mankind, considering Colombia\u2019s rich biodiversity\nand its 578,000 square kilometres of jungle, which are\nthreatened by illicit drugs. To guarantee their food\nsecurity, we are also subsidizing 700,000 farmers, and\n3\n\nthat number will soon reach 1 million; we are also\nsubsidizing the crops of farmers\u2019 associations until they\nbecome productive and competitive. Poverty indicators\nshould take account of such subsidies, which are\nusually not included when measuring the income of\nthose families.\nColombia has suffered a tragedy in the form of\ninternal displacement. We have reduced its incidence\nby 40 per cent, but it is still high. We have facilitated\nthe return of more 70,000 people and we expect that\nnumber to increase. One State agency alone has\nmultiplied eightfold its budget to care for displaced\npersons.\nAs a result of a law approved at the beginning of\nthis Government\u2019s tenure, the process for \u201cownership\nextinction\u201d for illegally acquired assets has moved\nmore quickly. We expect that that mechanism will be\nused to advance constructive agrarian reform.\nBy paying additional taxes, the Colombian people\nare making an effort to finance security measures and\nrestore social investment levels, for a total that\nrepresents 2 per cent of our gross domestic product. We\nhave received the support of the multilateral banks, but\nwe require greater understanding from the financial\nmarkets: longer-term loans and lower interest rates. We\nare engaged in an intense struggle, and we need better\naccess to the markets of the industrialized countries.\nI would like to reaffirm Colombia\u2019s commitment\nto multilateralism. Multilateralism must continuously\nimprove if it is to become more effective and restore\nthe lost consensus for safeguarding international peace.\nBuilding that consensus requires each State to feel that\nit is being heard and that it is being taken into account.\nI am grateful for the support of the United\nNations agencies in social matters. We are fully\nprepared to back the efforts of the international\ncommunity to consolidate democracy and security in\nthe region, especially in Haiti. Colombia will be part of\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We\nwill cooperate with police experts in the fight against\ndrug trafficking, as well as with the humanitarian\npresence.\nMr. Baali (Algeria), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nWe must all join in an effective international\nsolidarity movement with our Caribbean brothers, who\nare so seriously affected by the hurricane season.\nWe need the total commitment of the\ninternational community in the struggle against\nterrorism in Colombia. Terrorism in one country feeds\nand strengthens terrorist networks throughout the\nworld. The widows and orphans of violence in our\ncountry ask why we attach so much importance to\nterrorism in other parts of the world, and why some\nattach so little to the terrorism that besets Colombia. I\nmake this appeal from the depths of our profound\ndemocratic conviction. It is difficult to find another\ncountry facing such a challenge of terrorism while\nsimultaneously strengthening its democracy.\nToday, Colombia offer effective guarantees for\nthe exercise of political pluralism by means of our\ndemocratic security policy. Our institutions combat\nterrorism with the unflinching political will of the\nGovernment. They do so with courage, selflessness and\ntransparency. A dirty war has no place in our policies.\nA democratic State has the right to ask the world\nto demand that the terrorists return their kidnap victims\nrather than clamouring for lopsided agreements with\nterrorists. We ask the world for more decisive and more\neffective support. If it is broadened, the violent groups\nwill have no option but to abandon terrorism and to\naccept peace.\nWith the people of Colombia, its democratic\ninstitutions and the international community united, we\ncan make Colombia an example of the capacity to\ndefeat terrorism and observe human rights. And we can\nmake Colombia an example of the ability to defeat\nterrorism and of the will to build social justice.\nWe will expel terror with the help of legitimate\ninstitutions and of a community of solidarity and\njustice, with opportunities for its poorest members."

        "file_text": "I congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your presidency and know well that we are\nin excellent hands. I should also like to pay tribute to\nMr. Julian Hunte for his excellent stewardship of the\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nWe are enthusiastic at the forthcoming 10-year\nreview of the Barbados Programme of Action. We see\nit as an extension and implementation of the\n4\n\ncommitments agreed to in the Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation and, in particular, in its chapter VII.\nWhilst the developmental path to Mauritius in January\n2005 has been fraught with its own challenges, it is\ncritical to small island developing States that the\nimpetus for that important global review not be lost in\nits own rhetoric. It is paramount that the outcomes\nfrom Mauritius be refined and focused on translating\nthe oft-quoted special case of small island developing\nStates into firm and timely support and global\nimplementation. As such, participation by all member\nStates in the forthcoming preparatory process and in\nthe International Meeting in Mauritius is essential to\nrealizing our development aspirations.\nThe geographical makeup of small island States\nputs some of our islands at a disadvantage. That is\nbecause economic development has focused on larger\nislands with large populations, which thereby enjoy a\nhigher per capita income than do other islands of the\ncountry. That is true of Tonga, where the main focus of\ndevelopment has been devoted to the larger islands of\nthe three main island groups, but within each of those\nthree groups other islands need further economic\ndevelopment. Three remote islands to the north, known\nas the Niuas, are disadvantaged by the tyranny of\ndistance and are in fact in closer proximity to Samoa\nthan they are to our own capital. The outlying islands\nof the Vava\u2019u and Ha\u2019apai groups are less developed\nthan their main islands, while `Eua to the south-east of\nTongatapu has potential but needs targeted inputs.\nThough we have designated core donors to those\nislands, their further development will need additional\nor new resources. So I hope that, in the review of the\nBarbados Programme of Action, some thought is given\nto the lot of those living on these disadvantaged\nislands.\nAs a developing ocean State, we are vigilant\nabout progress in ocean affairs and law of the sea\nissues. We consider the valuable contribution made by\nthe meeting of States parties to the Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea and its subsidiary bodies \u2014 in\nparticular, the achievements of the International\nSeabed Authority, to whose mandate a research\nfunction should be added, and the work of the\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \u2014\nworthy of mention. Together with the important role of\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative\nProcess, this sets a firm and practical platform for our\nwork during this session.\nI am happy to note that the third informal meeting\nof States parties to the United Nations Fish Stocks\nAgreement has seen firm commitments by certain\nStates Parties to enable the implementation and\nconcrete operation of elements of part VII of the\nAgreement with special emphasis on and relevance to\nsmall island developing States. We continue to\nencourage other member States to become parties to\nthe Agreement.\nWe are particularly pleased that the Convention\nfor the Conservation and Management of Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central\nPacific Ocean entered into force earlier this year. We\nconsider that special milestone worthy of note in the\nAssembly\u2019s work.\nWanton acts of terrorism continue to test our\nfortitude as members of the international community.\nWe must remain collectively resolute in our resolve to\nprevent and vigorously combat the proponents of that\nevil, and we must be innovative and versatile in our\npursuit of meaningful countermeasures and lasting\nsolutions.\nWe continue to strongly support the work of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee and applaud the recent\nrevitalization of it and its work. Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) remains the basis of domestic\nmeasures implemented by my Government, including\nthe submission of country and, where appropriate,\nregional reports. It is useful to identify areas where\nfinancial and technical assistance is necessary to\nenable stronger compliance by all States in meeting\ntheir international obligations.\nAfter eight years of negotiations, Tonga\u2019s\naccession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in\nthe final stages. Bilateral market access agreements on\ngoods and services have been concluded with\nAustralia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New\nZealand and Panama. Agreement with the United\nStates is outstanding, as it has requested that we accede\nto the Chemical Harmonization Agreement and the\nInformation Technology Agreement. Although this is\nan additional burden on us, we do understand that the\nUnited States is requesting the same commitments\nfrom every acceding country. The working group\nreport has been discussed at informal working parties\nand so gives rise to cautious optimism that we could\nconclude the process before the 2005 ministerial\nmeeting.\n5\n\nTonga needs the understanding and the support of\nall WTO members as we seek commitments\ncommensurate with the size of our economy and the\nstage of our development. To be sure, Tonga is not\nseeking greater market access, but desires security for\nits trade under a rule-based, multilateral trading\nsystem.\nTonga adheres strictly to the \u201cone China\u201d policy\nand recognizes that Taiwan is an inalienable part of\nChina. We welcome the shared principle of non-\ninterference in each other\u2019s internal affairs and, as\nsuch, we consider that delicate and sensitive issues are\nbest dealt with in an across-the-Strait dialogue rather\nthan at international forums.\nWe welcome the expanding cooperation with\nChina and recognize that its huge market provides a\nrange of commercial, financial and trade possibilities\nfor us and, to that end, Tonga has adopted a \u201clook east\u201d\npolicy. To give effect to its interests in China, Tonga\nwill soon establish a diplomatic presence in Beijing to\nexplore those interests further.\nFor a decade now, we have exported our squash\nproduce to Japan and, more recently, we have been\nexporting specially cultivated seaweed to its markets. It\nis timely that we now explore further forms of\ncooperation with Japan in the field of fisheries, trade in\nother produce, financial and investment possibilities, as\nwell as education and training. To pursue those\ninterests, we are giving thought to a possible presence\nin Tokyo, although such an undertaking will be\ndetermined by available financial resources. The policy\ndoes not supplant the long-existing warm ties of\nfriendship we enjoy with Australia, New Zealand,\nFrance and the United States in the Pacific region, as\nthose friendly ties and a broad range of cooperation are\nfirmly rooted in our policy.\nMy Government has approved the fourth\ndeployment later in the year of police officers to the\nRegional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands\n(RAMSI). Also, approval has been given for the\ndeployment of the third contingent of defence\npersonnel for 2005, in concert with the agreed rotation\nformula under RAMSI.\nWe all look forward to the report of the High-\nLevel Panel. Judging from the makeup of the Panel and\nits formidable credentials, I should think the report and\nrecommendations will set the tone for the constructive\nengagement of the General Assembly.\nThe membership of the Security Council ought to\nbe expanded in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories in accordance with the realities of the day\nand perceptions of tomorrow. We believe that Japan\nshould be a permanent member and that there should\nbe a permanent seat for Africa and another for Latin\nAmerica.\nFive years ago, Tonga was admitted to\nmembership of the United Nations and has since\nactively participated in United Nations activities. It is\nnow giving favourable consideration to contributing to\nthe United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Consequently,\narrangements for our participation will be discussed\nfurther with the United Nations. The scope of our\ndeployment will be fashioned by our available\nmanpower and financial capacity.\nAlthough violence renders an enduring peace\nelusive, we continue to harbour hopes that a lasting\npeace can soon be concluded so that a Palestinian State\ncan be established, living side by side with the State of\nIsrael in internationally recognized borders and in\npeace and security.\nOur development has been made possible through\ndomestic resources and also through bilateral and\nmultilateral programmes of assistance, all of which\nhave been highly appreciated. Our major donor\npartners have been Australia, China, the European\nUnion \u2014 with some members providing additional\nassistance \u2014 Japan and New Zealand. The United\nStates provides assistance through its fisheries treaty\nwith the Pacific region and through other avenues. In\nrecent times, India, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia\nhave provided technical assistance. The United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the Global Environment\nFacility, the United Nations Environment Programme,\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\nGlobal Fund, the World Bank and other financial\ninstitutions have provided various forms of assistance\nand technical expertise. Much of the technical\nassistance is channelled to combating diabetes and\ntuberculosis and preventing the spread of the\nHIV/AIDS. Other assistance has been directed at\nmeeting our Millennium Development Goals and to\nsmall community programmes and projects."

        "file_text": "I\nwish to express our satisfaction at seeing Mr. Ping\npreside over this fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly and we wish him a successful presidency.\n24\n\nEver since the signing of the Charter of San\nFrancisco, and before that during the time of the\nLeague of Nations, Chile has been firmly committed to\nthe international community, to multilateral\ncooperation and to the best values of peace, security,\ndevelopment and human rights which this Organization\nrepresents. Chile has been an active participant in the\ninternational system because we believe that\ngovernance at the global level is the logical extension\nof the institutional order that each State has achieved\nand can demonstrate in this global forum.\nWhile in the last century our main task was to\nestablish rules of coexistence and conduct for the\ninternational community, today, faced with the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, that task, in our\nopinion, has become more urgent and ineluctable.\nWhat we have before us is a panorama of positive\nopportunities, on the one hand, and of complex threats,\non the other.\nFor countries such as ours, integration into the\nglobal community creates opportunities which a closed\nsociety would preclude. We see integration into the\nglobal community as providing possibilities for growth\nand for creating space for our efforts, and we feel that\nthis is the inescapable destiny of all of us. Countries\nneed freedom, peace, security and respect for\ninternational law; based on scrupulous respect for\ntreaties, we need to work towards the building of a\nshared global order.\nStability can be achieved only through\ngovernance under which all interests are represented.\nThus, voices are being raised in various countries in\norder to state the obvious: no one can shape the world\nthat is emerging except through agreements and\nnegotiations. The complexity of the world emerging\nbefore our eyes is too great to be handled in a\ncentralized or unipolar manner.\nOf course, little will be achieved if, at the same\ntime, each country does not put its own house in order.\nWithout justice, solidarity and respect for human\nrights, there can be no stable or genuinely beneficial\ngovernance in our own societies in the medium term. I\ntherefore believe that it is the responsibility of each of\nour societies to apply the principles of the United\nNations and to make them realities. We have an ethical\nduty to be efficient and effective in the attainment of\nthose goals and ideals.\nIt is clear, however, that globalization also\nincludes negative aspects that can affect us all. Today,\nwe are afflicted by such public evils as terrorism and\norganized crime; illicit trafficking in persons, arms and\ndrugs; and the money-laundering associated with those\nactivities.\nNothing is more counter to our principles than\nterrorism, a virtual dark force of globalization.\nAccordingly, here in the United Nations, Chile has\ncontributed through its efforts in chairing both the\nAl Qaeda/Taliban Security Council sanctions\nCommittee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee, key\ninstruments of the international community for waging\nthis combat. Globalization also has negative spill-over\neffects on the environment and exacerbates the\nmarginalization of millions of people in societies or\neven continents who are unable to achieve integration\ninto the global economy and global society.\nFaced with that reality of light and shadow,\ncountries like Chile have a stake in helping to improve\nthe positive aspects of globalization and to eliminate\nits negative aspects. But how do we turn those aims\ninto reality? In our view, the best way to guide the\nagenda of globalization is through multilateralism. It is\nin the strengthening of multilateralism that each\ncountry has a stake and a national task to fulfil.\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil, Chile has assumed its responsibility to the\nglobal community and has sought to act consistently\nwith our values and convictions. Last year, with regard\nto Iraq, we said that only the United Nations could give\nthe necessary legitimacy for the use of force and for\naddressing in an effective and unified manner the\nthreats to peace arising from that country. For that\nreason, and in order to be consistent with our\ncommitment to multilateralism, we said yes to the\nUnited Nations when the Security Council requested\nthe presence of a multinational interim force in Haiti.\nWe reacted in solidarity by dispatching to Haiti, in less\nthan 72 hours, a military force and humanitarian\nassistance.\nWe have shown that our region is capable of\nassuming the responsibilities required to ensure\ninternational peace and security. Not since the period\nof our national independence have forces from\ndifferent Latin American countries acted collectively\nand independently of the great Powers in a mission to\nmaintain peace in one of our countries. Today in Haiti,\n25\n\nthe troops of a number of Latin American countries,\nsupplemented by the joint Spanish/Moroccan force, are\nunder the command of a Brazilian general and the\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General is a Chilean.\nIf we wish to strengthen multilateralism, reform\nof the United Nations is becoming increasingly\nnecessary. Its ideals and founding purposes remain\nvalid, but, as a number of speakers have noted here, the\npower structure upon which the Organization was built\nat its inception corresponds to a world that is very\ndifferent from today\u00eds world. Not only do we need to\nexpand the Security Council to make it more\ndemocratic; comprehensive reform of the Organization\nis also needed. In addition, the United Nations needs\nspecialization, not a proliferation of similar\ninstitutions. It needs greater accountability and a more\ntransparent system of recruitment. It needs to derive\nthe maximum benefit from every last cent that it\nspends. Many of our States are making those or similar\nchanges in their own public systems. The United\nNations can be better than we can in that area. It is a\nchallenge for the Organization and for each of our\nStates.\nI had the opportunity to exchange ideas with\nsome members of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change. That is why I am convinced\nthat the Panel will offer to the Secretary-General\nrecommendations aimed at strengthening two key\nareas: first, generate a political commitment that\nreaffirms the values of the Charter of the United\nNations; and, secondly, strengthen the system so that it\ncan face the challenges and opportunities of a world\nthat is more global than it was 60 years ago.\nThe world requires a larger and better United\nNations. We have unacceptable humanitarian crises,\nsuch as that in Darfur, Sudan; a steady deterioration in\nthe outlook for peace in the Middle East; and terrorist\nattacks, such as those in Beslan, Russia, and in front of\nthe Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia.\nIn the Security Council, Chile supported the\ntransfer of national sovereignty to the people of Iraq,\nand we hope to see the elections scheduled for next\nJanuary. In the case of Afghanistan, United Nations\nelectoral assistance has been essential in the\npreparations for the elections scheduled for the\nbeginning of October.\nThe world to which we aspire will be better and\nreflect greater solidarity with the effective participation\nof citizens. In that spirit, we will host in Chile next\nyear the Third Ministerial Conference of the\nCommunity of Democracies.\nLikewise, we are convinced that globalization\nwill be better only if civil society is recognized as one\nof its principal actors. That consideration has been a\ndecisive factor in the Action against Hunger and\nPoverty, which we \u00f3 together with the leaders of\nBrazil, France and Spain and the Secretary-General \u00f3\nhave promoted to effectively contribute to the\nattainment of the Millennium Goals.\nYesterday's meeting presented us with a great\nchallenge: have specific answers within 12 months,\nbefore the next General Assembly session. Some of the\nactions proposed depend on governmental decisions;\nothers are the responsibility of multilateral\norganizations and civil society \u00f3 particularly non-\ngovernmental organizations, the business community,\ntrade unions and universities. We say clearly: it is time\nto recognize that, in practical terms, the exclusive\nmonopoly of States or Governments in the international\nsphere has ended; everyone is called upon to\nparticipate.\nThe question is whether reform is possible. Why\nwould the powerful give up some of their power? Our\nmodest experience has shown us that one can negotiate\nfree trade, for example, with the world\u00eds most\nindustrialized countries and reach agreements\nbeneficial to both sides. Today, trade agreements cover\ntwo thirds of our exports, more than half of which are\nalready free from tariffs. That has not been a simple\nmatter; it requires time, preparation and patience. And\nwhy not say this? It involves a degree of conflict with\nthe more developed countries. Trade agreements, in\nand of themselves, do not provide solutions for a set of\nissues that can be resolved only at the multilateral\nlevel.\nThat is why we need to successfully conclude the\nDoha round, because there, decisive issues are at stake\nthat we have not been able to resolve through bilateral\nnegotiation. There we must resolve the issue of anti-\ndumping, the situation of subsidized agricultural and\ntextile products, complex issues such as those related\nto intellectual property, and the question of how to deal\nwith pandemics by using generic or low-cost drugs.\nThose issues are multilateral in nature. We must\ntherefore deal with them multilaterally, and in doing so\n26\n\nwe must be strong - we, the countries that understand\nthat we are going to define more just trade rules.\nIt is in that area that common sense is of much\nmore help than dogmatism. One cannot ask others to\ngive up their fundamental interests, but neither can\nanyone hope complacently for unfair results. That is\nwhy integration into the global society is a stairway\nwith many steps. What is important is not to lose a\nsense of progress \u00f3 progress towards trade that is free,\nbut fair; towards capital flows that are free, not\npredatory; towards cultural expansion, not destruction\nof what is local: our roots, what we are, our identities;\ntowards an exchange of ideas, not lockstep thinking \u00f3\nin short, towards pluralism, so that we all can be better.\nI have tried to share with the Assembly the vision\nand the responsibilities of a country of the South \u00f3 an\nopen country that is interdependent with the rest of the\nworld. Our modest experience has shown us that it is\nimperative to strengthen multilateralism as the only\napproach with the legitimacy necessary to ensure\ninclusive globalization that reflects solidarity - as has\nbeen said here, globalization with a human face.\nIn conclusion, today\u00eds world requires a larger, not\na smaller, United Nations and more, not less,\nmultilateralism. Our experience tells us that we can\nmake a reality of our shared dream - the dream that\nwas dreamt 60 years ago in San Francisco, but that\nnow obliges us to meet the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century that is beginning."

        "file_text": " At the outset, I wish to join\nother Member States in congratulating you,\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Given your\nextensive experience and wisdom, I am confident that\nyou will successfully steer the course of this session,\nwhich is important for the challenging world that we\nlive in today.\nI commend the efforts and the contribution to the\nUnited Nations of Mr. Julian Hunte as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, and I\nexpress my appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for his commitment, dedication and leadership\nin working to further the realization of the objectives\nand the mission of the United Nations in our\nincreasingly complex world.\nSince 11 September 2001, the response to\nterrorism at the global, regional and national levels has\nbeen significant and massive. Nevertheless, despite the\nprogress we have made in our efforts, countries\nthroughout the world continue to suffer from terrorist\nattacks that continue to kill innocent people. Therefore,\nI believe that our response to this deadly threat to\nhumanity must be more comprehensive. However, I\nalso believe that, while we fight terrorism relentlessly,\nwe should do our best to understand its true root\ncauses. When we are able to do that, we can hope to\neliminate terrorism.\nWhen the Millennium Development Goals were\nlaunched in 2000, they held much hope for developing\ncountries, but so far there have been no meaningful\nresults. Poverty on many parts of the globe remains\none of the greatest challenges in the world today, with\nmore than 1.2 billion people surviving on less than $1\nper day. Global poverty reduction is not the\nresponsibility of developing countries alone; it is also\nthe shared responsibility of the international\ncommunity, particularly the developed countries.\nPerhaps it is time for more concrete actions rather than\nmere declarations.\nWith regard to the Middle East conflict, I believe\nthat the international community should continue to\nsupport the inalienable and sacred right of the\nPalestinian people to an independent State. We should\nalso urge all parties involved to put an end to the\nviolence once and for all. All the parties must put aside\n4\n\ntheir hatred and their historical animosity. Both the\nPalestinians and the Israelis must realize that they have\nequal rights to coexist, living side by side in peace and\nharmony for the sake of their own peoples and peace in\nthe region.\nConcerning the situation in Iraq, I believe that the\ncurrent, unending violence there has not created an\nenvironment conducive to national reconciliation and\npeace. It is my view that the United Nations and the\ninternational community must do everything possible\nto restore peace, security and political stability to Iraq\nso that the Iraqi people will have a chance to choose, in\na sovereign manner, their own leaders and their own\nGovernment. I believe that democracy can never be\nexported or imported; it is a state of mind and must be\nlearned.\nWith regard to the Taiwan issue, Cambodia is of\nthe view that it is a vital issue not only for China, but\nalso for the region as a whole. Cambodia, like other\nmembers of the community of nations, has been\nunequivocally supportive of a genuine \u201cone-China\u201d\npolicy, since we recognize the fact that Taiwan is an\nintegral part of China.\nEvery year in the General Assembly, most\nmembers of this global institution have called for\nreform of the United Nations, particularly of the\nSecurity Council. Indeed, Cambodia is of the view that\nreform of the Council is essential, not only for the\ncredibility of the Council itself, but for that of the\nentire United Nations system as well. The reform of\nthe Security Council will undoubtedly reflect the\nrealities of the world today. In reforming the Council\nby enlarging its membership, we will make it more\nrepresentative, more democratic and more efficient. In\nthat regard, Cambodia supports the candidacies of\nJapan, Germany and India for permanent seats on the\nCouncil. The number of non-permanent members\nrepresenting various parts of the world should also be\nincreased.\nCambodia wishes to appeal to all Member States\nto support its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on\nthe Security Council for the period 2006-2007. Since\nwe joined the United Nations in 1955, Cambodia has\nnever held any position within it, although we have\nalways cooperated closely with the Organization.\nWith the formation of our new Government in\nJuly this year, and with the adoption of our rectangular\nstrategy and our political programme, the Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia has accorded top priority to\nbuilding good governance in order to carry out key\nareas of reform and the four pillars of its rectangular\nstrategy for socio-economic development.\nIn conclusion, I believe that we need to ensure\nthat the Millennium Development Goals are followed\nup and carried out in response to the hopes of the\nbillions of poor people who live in developing\ncountries. Moreover, I feel that poverty reduction\nshould remain a top priority to be addressed\ncollectively by the international community so that we\ncan close the gap between the haves and the have-nots.\nIn the light of the challenges that pose greater threats\nto our world today than ever before \u2014 terrorism,\nviolence, conflict, poverty, epidemics of infectious\ndiseases, environmental degradation and many\nothers \u2014 I firmly believe that we need a stronger and\nmore efficient United Nations to address those\nchallenges in the most effective way possible. In that\nregard, the Organization must be truly representative,\nfully democratic and strongly committed to the cause\nof humanity."

My delegation has\nevery confidence in your sagacity to guide this session\nand its deliberations to a fruitful conclusion.\nIt is also my pleasure to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte, for the\ncommendable manner in which he discharged his\nresponsibilities as the President at the fifty-eighth\nsession.\nAs well, I wish to take this opportunity to\ncompliment the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on\nhis diligence in promoting peace and pursuing the\nnoble principles of this Organization. My delegation\nsincerely wishes him every success in his daunting\ntask.\nThe unfolding international events bring to the\nfore the question of multilateralism and the vital role\nthe United Nations has to play in addressing global\ncrises and problems and in promoting a world order\nbased on the rule of law and the collective\nresponsibility of all nations and communities.\nThe global challenges that we face today are\nnumerous. While goals are set and programmes\nlaunched for eradicating poverty, achieving universal\nprimary education, promoting gender equality,\nreducing child mortality, fighting HIV/AIDS and\nprotecting the environment, hundreds of innocent lives\nare lost every day as a result of conflict and civil war.\nTerrorism has not been defeated. On the contrary,\nit is re-emerging in uglier manifestations in the most\nunexpected places, killing innocent people, including\nchildren. The disappointing impasse on global\ndisarmament and the dreadful odds of further\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction make us\nill at ease and cause us to lose hope for a peaceful\nworld.\nWe in small States feel more vulnerable to these\nchallenges and threats, as our security is entirely\ndependent on the prevalence of global security and the\nobservance of the rule of law by all States. Clearly, the\nconcerns of small States cannot be confined only to the\nissues of the environment, climate change, sea-level\nrise and sustainable development. The ominous threats\nthat are emerging on the political and security fronts of\nthe contemporary world have far-reaching implications\nfor us as well.\nNot too infrequently, we witness small States\nbeing victimized by non-State actors such as terrorists,\nmercenaries, insurrectionary gangs and organized\ncrime networks, whose calculated assaults disrupt\nsocio-economic and political development of small\nStates, endangering peace and security. It would be\nimprudent to ignore the wider implications of the\npresence and activities of such perilous actors on\ninternational peace and security. Solutions to those\nthreats can only be sought through international\ncooperation, vigilance and timely action.\nIt is imperative that the international community\ntakes on the crucial responsibility of protecting the\nsecurity of small States, as stipulated by General\nAssembly resolutions 44/51, of 8 December 1989,\n46/43, of 9 December 1991, and 49/31, of 9 December\n1994. With its global spread and ability to work in\ncollaboration with regional institutions, we see the\nOrganization as the most appropriate body to address\nsuch issues.\nTerrorism poses grave threats to regional as well\nas international peace and security. The train bombings\nin Madrid; car bombings and terrorist attacks in Iraq,\nIndonesia and Saudi Arabia; and, most recently, the\nhostage-taking tragedy in a Russian school, are all grim\nreminders of the particularly insidious nature of\nterrorism. I am sure that I echo the unanimity of the\ninternational community in reiterating that the war\nagainst terrorism should continue to remain a principal\npriority on the international agenda. My Government\n4\n\nbelieves that early adoption of the proposed\ninternational convention on terrorism would be a\ncrucial step in effectively combating that dreadful\nmenace.\nExpanding globalization and increasing trade\nliberalization, contrary to the hopes for a healthier\nglobal market, have had a distressing price tag for\nsmall economies, especially for small island economies\nsuch as the Maldives. Limited natural resources and the\nnarrow economic base of small island economies\nseverely restrict their scope for diversification and their\nability to attract foreign investment. Those\ndisadvantages call for special considerations, including\na level of preferential treatment, on an exceptional\nbasis, to ensure the sustainable development of small\nisland developing States.\nWhile the Maldives is beset by the entire range of\neconomic problems inherent to small island developing\nStates, the recommendation by the Committee for\nDevelopment Policy (CDP) to graduate us from the list\nof least developed countries has compounded the\nchallenges to our development. We do take pride in our\nachievements in the social and economic sectors during\nthe last two decades. However, we fear that graduation\nmay cause enormous and irreparable damage to our\neconomy, in the absence of a suitable mechanism to\nensure sustained socio-economic development. In that\ncontext, we welcome the recommendation of the CDP\nand the decision of the Economic and Social Council\nearlier this year indicating the need to formulate\nsmooth transition strategies for least developed\ncountries prior to their graduation.\nWe support in particular the recommendation to\ndecide post-graduation transition arrangements on a\ncase-by-case basis and to establish ad hoc country\nadvisory groups to help formulate those arrangements.\nWe strongly feel that it is important for the Economic\nand Social Council to formally endorse the\narrangements proposed by the ad hoc country advisory\ngroups while mandating the CDP with the task of\nmonitoring the progress of newly graduated countries\nfor any disruptions in their development.\nAllow me, at this juncture, to register our sincere\ngratitude and appreciation to our development partners\nand the members of the Group of 77, the Group of\nLeast Developed Countries and the Bureau and\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council for the\nunderstanding and the care with which they are\nproceeding on this crucial and important issue.\nThe state of the global environment is as\ndepressing as ever. Statistical information and\nprojections are alarming and disturbing, not only to\nsmall island developing States but also to the entire\ninternational community. Those figures and predictions\nreveal the severity of environmental problems and the\npotential threats to human existence unless swift\nremedial measures are implemented.\nThe frequency with which we have been\nwitnessing natural disasters such as hurricanes and\ncyclones around the world demonstrates the urgent\nneed to tackle environmental issues on a global scale.\nMany small island developing States suffer\ndisproportionately from such hazards, underscoring the\nvulnerability of small island developing States in that\nregard. As we recently witnessed in Grenada, a single\nhurricane can lay waste to decades-long developmental\nprogress in a matter of a few hours.\nWe will soon be meeting in Mauritius to review\nthe progress made over the past decade in the\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nStates. If we are to make the forthcoming meeting in\nMauritius a success, we need to muster the necessary\npolitical will to channel resources and to ensure the\ncomprehensive realization of the objectives of the\nBarbados Programme of Action.\nThe complexity and magnitude of ever-\ndeveloping global challenges demand that a reformed\nUnited Nations be assigned the central role in dealing\nwith them. While those reforms should cover the entire\nUnited Nations system and its bodies, the focus is once\nagain justly being drawn to the urgency of the need to\nrestructure the Security Council, making the Council\nmore reflective of the realities of the present-day world\nand more representative of the capacity and\ncommitment of Member States to contribute to\ninternational peace and security. It is disappointing,\nthough, that no common view has emerged on that\nissue. We feel that we should go ahead with the\nenlargement of the Security Council, both in the\npermanent and non-permanent categories and including\nin that enlargement countries such as Japan and other\nMember States that have the capacity and the\ncommitment to serve as permanent members and that\n5\n\nwould represent the wider membership of the present-\nday United Nations.\nThe international treaty regime has to be\nexpanded and strengthened so that emerging problems\ncan be dealt with more effectively. We feel that that\ntask should be a priority in enforcing the principles for\nwhich the United Nations stands and the values of\npeace, security, justice, equality, human rights,\ndemocracy and rules-based international order that it\nhas advocated. In that context, we applaud the remarks\nmade by the Secretary-General at the opening meeting\nof the General Assembly, and wish to express our\nsupport for his efforts to reform the United Nations\nsystem.\nThe rapid socio-economic development attained\nby the Maldives in the past two and a half decades is in\nno small part grounded in the political stability that we\nhave enjoyed during that period. To emphasize further\nthe need to promote and sustain the values of\ndemocracy and respect for human rights, President\nGayoom proposed a sweeping agenda for political\nreform in early June of this year. The Government\nremains firmly committed to carry out the reform\nagenda, which has been welcomed and supported by\nboth the people of the country and its friends in the\ninternational community. A special people\u2019s assembly\nwas convened, as required by the Constitution, and was\ncharged with the task of debating reforms to the current\nConstitution proposed by the Government and civil\nsociety.\nWe seek the support and assistance of our friends\nin the international community in our pursuit of that\nunprecedented reform agenda. The solidarity of the\ninternational community at this crucial hour of need\nwould reinforce our resolve and help us move ahead\nwith the reform agenda with increased veracity and\ndiligence.\nMy Government is also committed to respecting\nand observing human rights through adherence to\nrelevant international conventions. In that regard, I am\npleased to announce that the Maldives will this week\nsign a framework agreement with the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross. We will also keep under\nconsideration the signing of other important\ninstruments, such as the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court.\nBefore concluding, I should like to reaffirm our\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter.\nMy country believes this Organization to be the best\nsuited to working for the betterment of humanity and\nthe maintenance of international peace and security."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to\naddress the General Assembly for the first time. On\nbehalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I\nconvey to you, Mr. President, and to other members of\nthe Bureau our warm congratulations on your election\nto steer the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.\nI am confident that, with your experience and\nprofessionalism, you will lead us to the fruitful\nconclusion of this session. I would also like to pay\ntribute to His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for his\noutstanding performance as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session.\nKenya is convinced that a vibrant, responsive and\nrepresentative United Nations system is the desire of\nall Member States. My delegation welcomes the\nongoing efforts to reorganize and revitalize the United\nNations to make it more effective and efficient. The\nrevitalization exercise must reaffirm the status of the\nGeneral Assembly as the pre-eminent policy-making\norgan of the United Nations, as envisaged in the United\nNations Charter. With respect to the Security Council,\nit should be enlarged, democratized and made more\nrepresentative to reflect the Organization\u2019s membership\nin the twenty-first century. We look forward to the\nfindings of the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, appointed by the Secretary-\nGeneral during last year\u2019s session of the General\nAssembly.\nI pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his commitment and\nhis efforts to ensure the capacity of United Nations\noffices, in particular the United Nations Office at\nNairobi, the only United Nations headquarters in a\ndeveloping country. We are encouraged to note that,\nduring the fifty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly, budgetary provisions were made for\nimproving and modernizing conference facilities at the\nNairobi Office. Nonetheless, there is still a great deal\nto be done. We urge the Secretary-General to\nsignificantly increase the regular budget component of\nfunding the United Nations Office at Nairobi to bring it\nin line with the administrative and financial\narrangements of similar United Nations Offices at\nGeneva and Vienna.\nThe production, stockpiling, transfer and use of\nanti-personnel mines are problems of major\nproportions that have caused untold suffering to\npopulations throughout the world, with Africa the most\nmine-affected continent. Kenya has been given the\nhonour to host the First Review Conference of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and\non Their Destruction \u2014 the Ottawa Convention.\nThe Conference \u2014 also known as the 2004\nNairobi Summit on a Mine-free World \u2014 will be held\nfrom 29 November to 3 December 2004. Among the\nevents scheduled will be the pre-Conference\nceremonies on 28 November, presided over by the\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya, the Honourable\nMwai Kibaki, who has extended invitations to world\nleaders to attend the Conference. I take this\nopportunity to invite each and every one of those\npresent here to participate at the highest possible level\nat the Conference. I also encourage them to take\nadvantage of their presence in Nairobi to sample\nKenya\u2019s hospitality and particularly its world-famous\nsafaris, as well as the sandy beaches along Kenya\u2019s\ncoast.\n27\n\nInternational peace, security and stability are\nprerequisites for sustainable development. Kenya\nrecognized early that peace and stability should be the\ncornerstone of both its national and foreign policies.\nConsequently, Kenya has taken an active part in the\nsearch for peaceful solutions to conflicts in our\nsubregion, in Africa and in the rest of the world.\nWithin the framework of the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), Kenya is chairing\nthe southern Sudan peace process and the Somali\nreconciliation process. I am pleased to report that, in\nthe Sudan peace process, milestones have been\nachieved since the signing of the first protocols in\n2002. The Nairobi Declaration on the final phase of the\nSudan peace process was signed on 5 June 2004.\nAlthough the process has been long and tedious, a\nfinal peace agreement is within reach for the two-\ndecade-long conflict. I would like to appeal to the\ninternational community to redouble its support and\ncommitment in assisting the people of the Sudan to\nachieve peace through constructive dialogue. It is also\nmy hope that events in the Darfur region will not\nsubsume the positive developments achieved by the\nNaivasha process. However, post-conflict\nreconstruction will require considerable resources. The\ninternational community must rise to that challenge.\nAs regards the Somali peace process, I am\npleased to report encouraging developments in the past\nfew weeks that indicate a willingness on the part of the\npeople of Somalia to embrace peace after 14 years of\nturmoil. In mid-August, 275 members of Parliament\nwere elected by representatives of the Somali people,\nand the Transitional Federal Parliament of the Somali\nRepublic was inaugurated on 29 August in Nairobi.\nSubsequently, the Parliament elected its Speaker on 15\nSeptember 2004. It is expected that the President will\nbe elected next month. The process has been long and\ncostly, but, as a result of our determination and\noptimism, we hope to witness the installation of a\nFederal Government of Somalia by the end of this year.\nThe presence of a Government in Mogadishu, however,\nshould be not an end in itself, but the beginning of a\nlong journey towards peace, stability and development.\nI appeal to the international community, and\nespecially the United Nations, to move with speed and\nto provide the support necessary for capacity-building,\ninfrastructure and security and other logistical support\nfor the new Government. I would like to express\nKenya\u2019s gratitude for the assistance provided by IGAD\nPartners Forum, the United Nations and the\ninternational community as a whole in support of both\npeace processes.\nLong-standing conflicts in our subregion have led\nto the proliferation of small arms and light weapons,\nwhich constitute major security concerns to my country\nand others. For example, Kenya has been at the\nforefront of regional initiatives to combat this menace.\nIn March 2000, Kenya hosted the First Ministerial\nReview Conference of the Nairobi Declaration on the\nProblem of the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in the Great Lakes Region and the Horn\nof Africa, which produced the Declaration. In April\nthis year, Kenya hosted the Second Ministerial Review\nConference of the Nairobi Declaration, which adopted\nthe Nairobi Protocol for the Prevention, Control and\nReduction of Small Arms and Light Weapons. Those\nefforts are intended to consolidate a regional\nframework within which to deal with the problem of\nproliferation in order to improve security so that the\npeople of the region can redirect their energies and\nresources towards meaningful economic activities.\nKenya therefore welcomes and fully supports the\nconvening of the international conference for the Great\nLakes region on conflict and development, scheduled\nfor 17-20 November 2004 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\nMy delegation applauds the United Nations and the\nAfrican Union for mobilizing support and resources for\nthe preparation of the conference.\nThe threat of international terrorism remains real.\nWe unreservedly condemn all acts of international\nterrorism. On behalf of my delegation and the Kenyan\npeople, I extend our sympathy to the Government and\npeople of Russia on the recent barbaric terrorist attack\non innocent school children, parents and teachers in\nBeslan. Kenya has been a victim of terrorist attacks in\nthe recent past. We are therefore more convinced than\never of the need to address this issue collectively. No\nsingle country, however resourceful, has the capacity to\nsuccessfully deal with it on its own. I would like to\nassure the Assembly that Kenya fully supports\ninternational efforts in dealing with this problem.\nCollective efforts to address the issue must be through\ninternational cooperation, information and intelligence\nsharing, coordinated by the United Nations.\nIn line with the international efforts to ensure that\npeace and security prevail, we welcome the decision by\nthe African Union to establish a standby African force.\n28\n\nKenya has been honoured to host one of the regional\ncentres, the Eastern Africa Brigade. We are ready to\nprovide the requisite facilities and logistical support to\nthe centre. On the international arena, Kenya has long\nbeen a major troop-contributing country in\npeacekeeping operations and will continue to actively\nparticipate with other nations under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations. We call upon the international\ncommunity to assist the African Union in realizing the\nestablishment of the force, which will be one of the key\ntools for ensuring peace and stability on the continent.\nPoverty remains a major impediment to\nsustainable development, particularly for developing\ncountries. Current trends indicate that countries in sub-\nSaharan Africa will not meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015. We emphasize\nthe importance of the fulfilment of the eighth\nMillennium Development Goal on a global partnership\nfor development, and especially the realization of the\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as\nofficial development assistance from developed\ncountries. We therefore look forward to the outcome of\nthe 2005 high-level plenary of the General Assembly\non the review of the implementation of the outcomes of\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in\nthe economic, social and related fields, including the\nMillennium Declaration.\nThe attainment of the Millennium Development\nGoals will depend on how effectively we deal with the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and other related communicable\ndiseases, among other problems. In sub-Saharan\nAfrica, it has resulted in a reversal of economic and\nsocial gains made over the years. Governments need to\ndevelop strategic plans that identify key priority\nresponse areas, such as prevention and advocacy,\ntreatment, care and support. Also important are the\nmitigation of the socio-economic impact and research.\nWe are grateful to our development partners and the\nUnited Nations Global Fund for their support and\nprovision of resources in fighting these diseases. We\nlook forward to their continued assistance.\nAt the regional level, tremendous progress has\nbeen made towards regional economic integration. The\nEast African Community Customs Union Protocol,\nwhich was signed on 2 March 2004 by Kenya, Uganda\nand Tanzania, is intended to create a single investment\nand trade area. We hope that this positive development\nwill encourage local and foreign direct investment in\nthe subregion.\nWe welcome the support accorded to the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD)\ninitiative by the United Nations and the G-8 countries.\nHowever, we regret to note that the commitments made\nto the NEPAD initiative have not been fully realized\nand call upon our development partners to fulfil their\npledges.\nThis year, Kenya is facing a severe famine caused\nby drought, which has affected a large section of the\npopulation. Consequently, Kenya and the United\nNations have issued a joint appeal for assistance to\ncontain the famine. We are grateful for the prompt\nsupport of the World Food Programme, the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations, the United Nations\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nand bilateral donors. However, the need for more\nassistance still exists.\nTo achieve long-term economic stability and\ndevelopment, the Government of Kenya has embarked\non an economic recovery strategy for wealth and\nemployment creation, aimed at revitalizing the\neconomy and enhancing the welfare of our people.\nOther measures have been taken to improve the well-\nbeing of the Kenyan people. Those include the\nimprovement and promotion of the welfare of children\nthrough free and compulsory primary education and the\nrecognition of the central role played by women in\ndevelopment.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize the\nimportant role the United Nations plays in global\naffairs. It could be greatly enhanced through adherence\nto the provisions of the Charter and to the rule of law.\nMember States should respect those instruments in the\nconduct of their international relations."

        "file_text": "First, I would like to\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon, on\nhis election as the President of the General Assembly.\nWe meet in New York under conditions of high\nsecurity. All over the world, Governments,\ncorporations and individuals are allocating vast\nresources to combat terrorism. The Beslan massacre\nlast month and the Jakarta bombing two weeks ago\nremind us once again that the war against terrorism is a\nlong struggle. Fighting it requires us to cooperate\nworldwide. It is also important for us to understand\nmore deeply why terrorists are prepared to sacrifice\ntheir own lives to take the lives of others, including\nthose of innocent children.\nThe human condition has not changed. There is in\nhuman beings a restless, competitive spirit that strives\nto get ahead, make discoveries and order or reorder the\nworld according to their values and world-view. It is a\ndrive that can lead to great good or great evil.\nThe greatest evil is often committed out of a\nsense of self-righteousness. That has been the case\nthroughout history. Al Qaeda carries out its actions in\nthe name of Islam, which is a gross perversion.\nReligious wars are the most cruel because human\nbeings are maimed and killed in the name of the divine.\nEthnic and ideological conflicts sometimes turn\n30\n\ngenocidal when one side believes that right is\ncompletely on its side.\nUnrestrained economic competition can also lead\nto grave injustice. Without rules, ruthless economic\ncompetition will return us to the jungle. Without the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), globalization can\nbecome a tool with which the strong can dominate the\nweak, just as in an earlier period entire continents were\ncarved up by imperial Powers.\nGlobal organizations like the United Nations and\nWTO give us hope that this century can be more\ncivilized than previous ones. We need rules that put\nlimits on our competitiveness in the political and\neconomic arenas. As in the Olympic Games, clear rules\nand their rigorous enforcement enable individuals to\ncompete fiercely and triumph within a framework of\nsportsmanship and fairness. The rules are not there to\ndampen our natural competitive spirit, but to direct it\ntowards positive achievement.\nBut the rules have to be determined by common\nagreement. Their legitimacy is derived from the shared\nvalues that bind participants together. They have to\nevolve, along with our evolving sense of what is fair\nand proper. They cannot be imposed. If they are\nimposed, what we have will not be the Olympics but\nthe gladiatorial pits of the Roman Colosseum.\nAt the most fundamental level, discussions and\ndebates in the United Nations and WTO are really\nabout the values that bind us together as human beings.\nAs the world grows smaller, our sense of\ninterdependence grows. As we interact more, we\ndiscover that we are more similar than we think. So\nmany problems like global warming, epidemics and\nterrorism can only be overcome if we work together.\nSo many new opportunities can only be fully exploited\nif we combine our efforts.\nYes, we have become closer. We celebrated together\nwhen for the first time the human genome was mapped a\nfew years ago. We grieved as one on 11 September\n2001. The slaughter of children at Beslan outraged us\nall. But will we ever be the same? That is not possible.\nIt is neither in our biological nature nor in the nature of\nthe historical process for human societies to converge\nand become identical. Even the same society changes\nover time in response to changing conditions.\nThere is in each and everyone of us a deep desire\nto be free, to experiment and to be better than others\naround us. Like all forms of energy, human energy\nmust be channelled so that it is constructive and not\ndestructive. That is the challenge of governance at all\nlevels, from the village all the way to global\ninstitutions. With the world becoming a village because\nof the ease of travel and instant communication, the\ndesign of global institutions is very important. They\nhelp us solve problems which we cannot solve\nindividually and set limits on acceptable behaviour.\nThe problem of Palestine, for example, cannot be\nsolved without the participation of the larger global\ncommunity. All of us are aware of the rights and\nwrongs, and sometimes particular issues are right or\nwrong, depending on our perspective. However, we\nshould never lose hope. We should always look for new\nand creative ways to break old deadlocks. After all, it\nwas only a few years ago that the prospects for peace\nseemed so much brighter.\nI remember when, as Singapore\u2019s Trade Minister,\nI met the Israeli Trade Minister at Davos in the year\n2000. He said that he would like to visit me in\nSingapore with his Palestinian counterpart and,\ntogether with me, to take a boat to the Singapore\nindustrial park on a nearby Indonesian island, where he\nhoped that we could all be received by the Indonesian\nTrade Minister. I was inspired and immediately worked\nwith my Indonesian counterpart on this project of\nunderstanding and goodwill. Unfortunately, within half\na year, the intifada began and the cycle of violence\nbecame steadily worse. It all seems such a long time\nago. However, we must never give up. With goodwill\nand statesmanship on both sides, and with the support\nof all of us in the international community, it is\npossible to re-establish trust and to start again.\nMoreover, the international community should\nnot allow the deteriorating relationship across the\nTaiwan Straits to spin out of control. The push towards\nindependence by certain groups on Taiwan is most\ndangerous, because it will lead to war with mainland\nChina and will drag in other countries. The stability of\nthe entire Asia-Pacific region is at stake. Not many\nyears ago, the relationship between the mainland and\nTaiwan was much better. In 1991, Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation (APEC) \u2014 a grouping of economies around\nthe Pacific Ocean \u2014 admitted China, Taiwan and Hong\nKong on the basis of certain agreed principles. At an\nAPEC meeting in 1992, I remember joining the Trade\nMinisters of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong for a\nrelaxed lunch in Bangkok. Later, in 1993,\n31\n\nrepresentatives from China and Taiwan met in Singapore\nfor informal talks, with both sides acknowledging, \u201cOne\nChina: to each its own interpretation\u201d.\nAll problems seemed soluble then. But, in 1994,\nTaiwanese President Lee Teng-hui gave a shocking\ninterview to a Japanese magazine, describing himself\nas a Moses leading his people out of Egypt. From then\non, cross-straits relations went from bad to worse as\npro-independence forces on Taiwan became\nincreasingly adventurous. As in the Middle East, the\ninternational community has a strong vested interest in\nsupporting a peaceful resolution of cross-straits\nconflict, based on the \u201cone China\u201d position that was\nadopted and settled by the United Nations in 1971.\nEven when the United Nations has no legal\nauthority to enforce its wishes, its views carry moral\nweight. This legitimacy of the Organization is derived\nfrom its broad membership, its transparent processes\nand the active participation of Member States. It is\nimportant that the Security Council \u2014 which has the\npower to adopt resolutions binding on all United\nNations Member States \u2014 be reformed and enlarged so\nas to reflect the reality of the current international\nenvironment.\nWe need rules that enable us to make decisions\nand to express our collective judgement of right and\nwrong, and those rules must evolve in response to new\nchallenges. However, we cannot expect unanimity of\nviews on all matters. Human society is changing all the\ntime. New scientific discoveries present new\nchallenges, to which different societies must respond\ndifferently. On matters of religious belief, for example,\nno one should expect convergence. Our disagreements\nover issues like the death penalty, abortion, the nature\nof democracy, gay rights, animal rights and therapeutic\ncloning are, in a sense, inevitable and necessary.\nWhat we profoundly need is respect for plurality in\nthe world \u2014 respect built on the common substrate that\ndefines us as civilized human beings in the twenty-first\ncentury. In the nineteenth century, slavery was abolished.\nIn the twentieth century, gender equality became the\nnorm. In this century, we must add more layers to what\nwe share in common. And, upon that shared substrate, we\nshould not only accept diversity, but encourage it. Indeed,\nas with biological diversity, it is essential for human\nprogress that there should be cultural and political\ndiversity in the world. Without such diversity, our\nability to respond to new challenges will be weakened.\nFor all their imperfections, the United Nations\nand the World Trade Organization (WTO) represent\nthis diversity in unity. At the WTO, the process of\nmultilateral trade negotiations \u2014 however complicated\nand arduous they may be \u2014 is still a more civilized\nmethod of resolving conflicts and harmonizing national\ndifferences than erecting protectionist walls and\nfighting trade wars.\nRespecting plurality does not mean that we stop\nrecognizing strengths and weaknesses; that would be\nhypocrisy. Some cultural values are more suited than\nothers to modern times. Some economic systems are\nmore productive. Some political systems are better able\nto mobilize the creative energies of their people. But\nnone of us should force our views on others. We should\nnever impose a particular political or economic system\non societies with different histories and traditions.\nWhat we need instead is an environment that\nencourages mutual learning and healthy competition.\nFor that, we need to respect one another.\nAs is recognized in the Millennium Development\nGoals, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the\nchallenge of human development. When Singapore\nbecame independent in 1965, there was no ready\nsolution that fitted us; we had to seek our own way\nforward. Many countries helped us with aid and advice,\nand we remain grateful to them. The United Nations\nDevelopment Programme provided valuable assistance.\nWith no natural resources, we had to organize\nourselves in a practical way, add value and be of\nservice to others. Little by little, we worked out\npragmatic solutions to our problems. Good governance\nwas a precondition for all our efforts. We were tough\non corruption and crime.\nWhen, in the 1970s, we witnessed attempts by\ninternational drug dealers to target young\nSingaporeans, our Parliament adopted draconian laws.\nWe were criticized by some of our friends in the\nWestern media, but we persisted, with the support of\nthe majority of Singaporeans, always acting with their\nconsent and in their interests. Now that we have\nreached a reasonable standard of economic\ndevelopment, other developing countries have\napproached us for assistance. We feel honoured to be\nasked. But we prefer them to see Singapore more as an\nongoing experiment to be studied than as a model to\nfollow. Every country is different, and each must\ncustomize its own solutions.\n32\n\nSmall countries like Singapore need a stable\nexternal environment. We are ardent supporters of\ninternational organizations like the United Nations and\nthe WTO, because they give us, together with other\ncountries, a say in global governance. A world in\nwhich countries big and small can resolve disputes\naccording to commonly agreed rules is infinitely\npreferable to one in which might makes right.\nMore than four centuries ago, a wise man from\nthe West visited the East. The Italian Jesuit Matteo\nRicci went to China with the goal of converting China\nto Catholicism. He had a deep respect for the\ncivilization that he wanted to Christianize. Realizing\nthat the only way to impress the Chinese was to\ninteract with them on their own terms, he proceeded to\nstudy the Chinese language, to master the Chinese\nclassics and to employ Chinese philosophical concepts\nin his discourses on Christianity. Instead of talking at\nthe Chinese, he talked to them, expressing concepts to\nwhich they could relate. Although Matteo Ricci did not\nsucceed in converting the Chinese, he left behind a\nlasting legacy, and when he died the Chinese Emperor\nconsented to his burial in China. His tomb, inscribed\nwith his Chinese name, is to be found today in the\ncompound of the Party School of the Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nHistory is unending. We need wise men like\nMatteo Ricci from the West and the East, from the\nSouth and the North, to help us, through debate and\ndialogue, prevent a clash of civilizations. Respecting\ndiversity should never reduce us to hypocrisy and\ncultural relativism, as if all points of view are equally\nvalid. We should never stop trying to influence one\nanother. Here in the United Nations we are always\ntrying to influence one another, but we must always be\nprepared to see the same issues from the perspectives\nof others. Here in the United Nations, we have an\ninstitution that can help us create this better world."

        "file_text": "I would like first\nof all to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Jean\nPing on his assumption of the presidency of General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. I have every\nconfidence that he will meet with distinction the\nchallenges of his eminent office. I would also like to\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Julian Robert Hunte, as well as to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan.\nThe past year has been marked by a series of\natrocious terrorist attacks. The stark reality is that no\npeople or nation is safe from the spectre of\ninternational terrorism. Through their cowardly acts,\nterrorists seek to generate chaos and fear, raining\nviolence upon the innocent \u2014 even children, as we so\n27\n\npainfully and clearly witnessed in the recent tragedy in\nBeslan, Russia. I would like to take this opportunity to\nextend my sincere sympathy to all those affected by\nterrorist attacks around the world.\nThe Republic of Korea has been no exception in\nits exposure to heinous terrorist attacks. In particular,\nwe experienced, with deep sorrow and pain, the loss of\na Korean \u2014 a victim of such savagery \u2014 in Iraq in\nJune this year. There can be no justification whatsoever\nfor such brutality and cruel disregard for human life.\nThat inhuman act has only bolstered our determination\nto rid the world of the dark cloud of terrorism. The\nRepublic of Korea remains firm in its conviction that\nthe international community must never give in to the\ndemands of terrorists.\nThe fight against terrorism calls for unity in the\ninternational community, with the United Nations in\nthe lead, as well as the enhanced ability of each\nindividual Member State to combat terrorism.\nIraq still remains a very pressing security concern\nfor the international community. The inauguration of\nan interim Government and the transfer of sovereignty\nset in motion the process of political transition towards\na new era of democracy for the Iraqi people. The\nUnited Nations has a wealth of experience to offer Iraq\nin the process of its political normalization and\nnational rehabilitation. The transition cannot proceed\nsmoothly, however, without the restoration of order. To\nthat end, the assistance of the international community\nis vital.\nThe Republic of Korea has been actively\nparticipating in international efforts to build a peaceful,\ndemocratic and prosperous Iraq. We strongly believe\nthat stability in Iraq is vital for peace and security in\nthe Middle East and beyond. In implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions 1511 (2003) and 1546\n(2004), we are in the process of dispatching 3,600\ntroops to the multinational forces in Iraq. The aim of\nthis is to assist the Iraqi people\u2019s efforts aimed at\nrehabilitation and reconstruction. We have also pledged\nto contribute $260 million to that end, focusing on\nareas such as health, education, capacity-building, job\ncreation and the provision of electricity.\nTerrorism lends renewed urgency to our common\nendeavour to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and their means of delivery. In particular,\nthis year\u2019s revelations about a nuclear black-market\nnetwork in Asia have alerted the international\ncommunity to the danger of nuclear weapons falling\ninto terrorist hands. Faced with this new kind of threat\nto nuclear non-proliferation, the international\ncommunity must work to close the loopholes in the\nexisting non-proliferation regime. Against that\nbackdrop, my Government strongly supports Security\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation,\nadopted by the Council in April this year.\nThe Republic of Korea has actively participated\nin the efforts of the international community in the\nnon-proliferation field. In February this year, we\nbecame the thirty-ninth country to ratify the Additional\nProtocol to the Safeguards Agreement. In June, we\njoined the Group of Eight (G8) Global Partnership\nagainst the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass\nDestruction in order to support joint efforts to stem the\nspread of deadly arsenals. We held the chairmanship of\nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group for the year 2003-2004,\nand we will also host the plenary meeting of the\nMissile Technology Control Regime in Seoul next\nmonth. These are just a few facts that attest to my\nGovernment\u2019s unwavering commitment to the cause of\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nGiven such a solid commitment on our part, my\nGovernment reported the recent discoveries about past\nscientific experiments involving nuclear materials in\nmy country pursuant to the additional protocol to the\nsafeguards agreement with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA). The experiments were\nisolated, laboratory-scale research activities that a few\nscientists conducted on their own for purely\nexperimental purposes. In good faith and with full\ntransparency, my Government has been providing full\ncooperation to the IAEA in its activities to review and\nverify our declarations on nuclear research activities.\nRenewing and reaffirming our commitment to\nnuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy, the Government of the Republic of Korea\nannounced the following \u201cFour Principles for the\nPeaceful Use of Nuclear Energy\u201d on 18 September 2004.\nFirst, the Republic of Korea reaffirms that it has\nno intention of developing or possessing nuclear\nweapons. Secondly, the Republic of Korea will firmly\nmaintain nuclear transparency and will strengthen our\ncooperation with the international community to this\nend. Thirdly, the Republic of Korea will faithfully\nabide by the norms set out in agreements on nuclear\nnon-proliferation, including the Treaty on the Non-\n28\n\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Joint\nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean\nPeninsula. Fourthly, on the basis of international trust\nand with the highest level of transparency, the Republic\nof Korea will continue to expand the peaceful use of\nnuclear energy.\nI would now like to turn to one of the most\nimportant tasks that lie ahead: resolving the North\nKorean nuclear issue. The Government of the Republic\nof Korea has been actively engaged in the efforts to\nbring about a peaceful resolution to this issue through\nthe six-party talks process. The Republic of Korea\nfirmly believes that the expeditious resolution of the\nNorth Korean nuclear issue is in the best interests of all\nthe participants in the six-party talks, including the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The resolution\nof this issue will certainly have a positive impact on\nthe global nuclear non-proliferation regime. It will also\nhave a profound effect on the relations between North\nKorea and the other countries participating in the six-\nparty talks.\nUpon the resolution of the nuclear issue, North\nKorea would indeed be able to become a full-fledged\nmember of the international community, enabling it to\ngain all the accompanying benefits. It is our fervent\nwish that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\nwill make a strategic decision to forgo all its nuclear-\nweapon programmes, including its uranium enrichment\nprogrammes, in a thorough and transparent manner.\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea also\nstrongly hopes that the fourth round of talks will be\nheld as soon as possible, so that we can engage in\nsubstantive discussions on concrete steps toward the\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nWhile seeking a peaceful resolution to the North\nKorean nuclear issue, the Korean Government is\nworking hard to ensure the steady improvement of\ninter-Korean relations. Indeed, Government-level\nmeetings have been institutionalized and as many as 90\nsuch meetings have been held over the past two years.\nImpressive progress is also being made on major\nprojects for economic cooperation. In particular, the\nstart of operations at the Gaesong industrial complex,\nscheduled for later this year, will be a significant\nachievement in inter-Korean cooperation.\nAs a result of such efforts, we believe that inter-\nKorean exchanges and cooperation have now advanced\nto a point from which there is no turning back. The rise\nof such inter-Korean interaction and interdependence\nwill certainly contribute to peace and prosperity on the\nKorean peninsula and beyond.\nThere are no easy answers to the many problems\nthe world now faces, and poverty is at the top of that\nlist. The roots of poverty run deep, with no simple\nsolution in sight. A large part of the human population\nstill languishes in abject poverty, presenting a serious\nstumbling block to the achievement of our shared goal\nof lasting peace and prosperity for all.\nFour years ago, the leaders of the world pledged\nto reduce by half the proportion of people living in\npoverty and hunger by the year 2015 as part of the\nMillennium Development Goals. However, at this\npoint, the gap between the objectives and the tangible\nprogress we have made remains wide. It is our sincere\nhope that the 2005 high-level meeting to review the\nprogress made in the implementation of the Goals will\nserve to renew our commitment to the world\u2019s poor.\nPolitical will is the key.\nOver the past year, the United Nations has\ncontinued its efforts to realize our common aspirations\nfor the promotion of human rights, freedom and well-\nbeing. While persevering in its quest to make human\nrights universal, the United Nations has exerted special\nefforts to enable the most vulnerable of our fellow human\nbeings to enjoy the rights and freedoms that should be\nguaranteed to all. In particular, much progress has been\nmade in the endeavours to draft a convention to\npromote the rights of persons with disabilities.\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea\nstrongly supports global action to strengthen the values\nof human rights and democracy around the world. Just\nlast week in Seoul, we organized a seminar on good\ngovernance practices for the promotion of human\nrights, in conjunction with the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\nNext year in Seoul, my Government will also\nhost the Sixth Global Forum on Reinventing\nGovernment, in cooperation with the United Nations.\nWe are convinced that this Forum will serve as a useful\nvenue for the exchange of experience in Government\ninnovations aimed at enhancing participation and\ntransparency in governance.\nWe also support the United Nations in reaching\nout to people in distress in many corners of the world\n29\n\nand providing life-saving assistance to millions of\nrefugees and others displaced by conflicts and natural\ndisasters. We share the concern of the international\ncommunity over the humanitarian crisis unfolding in\nDarfur, Sudan. Security Council resolution 1564 (2004)\nshould be implemented so as to bring back peace and\nstability to this troubled area and its inhabitants.\nFurthermore, all too often, the complexities of\nmajor crises have been fuelled by the public health\nemergency created by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In\norder to overcome the scourge of HIV/AIDS, it is vital\nthat we strengthen the global assistance mechanisms.\nIn this regard, the 3 by 5 Initiative of the World Health\nOrganization, aimed at providing antiretroviral\ntreatment to 3 million infected people by the year\n2005, is a very timely and proactive initiative.\nFor almost six decades, the United Nations has\nplayed a crucial role in merging the diverse interests of\nour Member States for the global good. As the\ninternational community becomes more interdependent\nand areas of cooperation expand further in the twenty-\nfirst century, the world body will have an even greater\nrole to play.\nMeanwhile, doubts have been expressed as to\nwhether the current United Nations system is suitable\nfor confronting the challenges of the new century. As\nthe Secretary-General has pointed out, the United\nNations has come to a fork in the road. Choices must\nbe made if the United Nations is to be strengthened and\nmade more effective.\nIn that regard, the Republic of Korea hopes that the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change\nestablished on the recommendation of the Secretary-\nGeneral will identify the challenges the international\ncommunity faces and recommend ways to deal with\nthem effectively. We look forward to the Panel\u2019s report\nand hope that its recommendations will shed light on\nways to make the United Nations more effective and\nresponsive to the needs of the twenty-first century.\nNo doubt, continued reform of the United Nations\nwill be an important part of our discussions. In\nparticular, the Security Council, as the primary organ\nfor maintaining peace and security, must be reformed\nin such a way as to make it more representative and\ndemocratic than it is today. In that regard, we share the\nview that the Security Council should be expanded to\nadequately reflect the increase in the membership of\nthe United Nations during the past decades. Expansion\nof the Security Council should be designed to enable\nmore countries to participate in the Council more often,\nand on the basis of a more equitable geographical\ndistribution. In that spirit, we support an increase in\nnon-permanent members so as to accord to those\nMember States willing and able to contribute to\ninternational peace and security greater opportunities\nto serve in the Council.\nAs diverse as they are, there is a common thread\nthat holds together all the views expressed in this\nhonourable Hall. We are all united in the goal of seeking a\nbetter and more peaceful world. Now more than ever,\ncountries are called to rise to challenges together, as\nMembers of our one global body. The Republic of\nKorea stands firm in its hopes for and belief in the\nUnited Nations as the steadfast anchor for our\ncollective endeavours and remains as committed as ever\nto fully playing its part in all areas of its noble work."

        "file_text": "Allow me to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the head\nof State, the Prime Minister and the Government and\npeople of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, my sincere congratulations on\nyour unanimous election to preside over the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session.\nAfrica is proud to see, yet again, one of its sons\nin that eminent role. The sign of confidence on the part\nof all States Members of the United Nations reflects\nthe great appreciation of the role being played by your\ncountry, Gabon, and by its President, His Excellency\nEl Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, in dealing with the\nmajor issues characterizing development in the world,\nparticularly in Africa.\nI am also gratified to have this opportunity to say\nhow grateful we are to your predecessor, Mr. Julian\nHunte, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia,\nwho, with his many years of skill as a diplomat,\nbrilliantly discharged his mission. He also deserves our\ngratitude and our plaudits.\nFinally, I would like to express my warm\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor the active and decisive role he has continued to\nplay as head of the United Nations.\nDuring the year 2004, the process of national\npeace and reconciliation initiated, following the\nsigning of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and of\nAccra II, by the parties and political forces in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire encountered a major deadlock with the events\nin March and the suspension of the activities of the\nGovernment of National Reconciliation.\nA solution to that dangerous deadlock required\ndetermined action from all parties involved. That\naction, fortunately, was forthcoming from the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, who took the initiative of organizing a high-\nlevel meeting on C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on 6 July 2004 in Addis\nAbaba at the time of the third summit of the African\nUnion. The major decision of that meeting was the\nconvening, in Accra, of a summit devoted to the crisis\nin the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The summit, known as Accra III,\nwas preceded, on the recommendation of the high-level\nmeeting in Addis Ababa, by meetings of the major\njoint Ivorian/Burkina Faso and Ivorian/Malian\ncommissions in July 2004, and by a mini-summit\nwhich brought together the heads of State of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Mali on 27 July 2004 in\nBamako.\nDuring those meetings, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire and Mali agreed, inter alia, on the need to\nrevitalize their cooperation in various areas, including\nhuman rights; the strengthening of safe economic\ncorridors pending the reunification of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire;\nthe strengthening of cooperation in security and\ndefence matters, especially the surveillance of borders;\na commitment not to allow the territory of one State to\nserve as a base for the destabilization of other States of\nthe subregion; and the commitment of the three\ncountries to work together to ensure the success of the\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration\nprogramme undertaken in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nThose various meetings between the C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire and its neighbours created a climate of\nconfidence and in part contributed to the success of the\nAccra III summit, held in the capital of Ghana on\n29 July 2004 under the co-chairmanship of His\nExcellency Mr. John Kufuor, President of Ghana and\nActing President of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), and the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand in the presence of ten heads of State of Africa, the\nChairperson of the Commission of the African Union\nand the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS.\n24\n\nIn the context of the holding, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, of\nopen, free and transparent elections in 2005, important\ndecisions accompanied by a road map were made at the\nAccra III summit. Thus, the President of the Republic,\nowing to the serious and continuing threats to the\nterritorial integrity of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire resulting from the\ncontinuing crisis, had to make use of the powers\nconferred on him by the Constitution, with a view to\nimplementing the provisions of section III, concerning\neligibility, of the programme of the Government of\nNational Reconciliation annexed to the Linas-\nMarcoussis Agreement, for the end of the month of\nSeptember 2004.\nThe National Assembly was due to be convened\nin special session before the end of August 2004 in\norder to consider and adopt all the legislative texts\nprovided for in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The\npolitical forces of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire committed themselves\nto beginning the disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration programme by 15 October 2004 at the\nlatest. Moreover, they requested that the Prime\nMinister and the Government set a timetable for the\nrestoration of State administration and public services\nthroughout national territory.\nAs of today, the results of the reforms are as\nfollows:\nOn the political level, we should note the\nreintegration of the three ministers who were dismissed\nfrom the Government of National Reconciliation and\nthe signing of a decree delegating powers to the Prime\nMinister. Thanks to these developments, the\nGovernment of National Reconciliation resumed its\nactivities, as shown by the meetings Council of\nMinisters held since then, in which all members of the\nGovernment participated.\nOn the legislative level, I am pleased to note the\nconvening of the deputies in a special session as of\n11 August 2004 to consider the most recent texts\nresulting from the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. I\nwould like to recall that the National Assembly has\nalready adopted laws on amnesty; the identification of\nindividuals and the stay of foreigners in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire;\nthe amendment of article 26 on rural land holdings; the\nfinancing of political parties, factions and electoral\ncampaigns under public funding; the declaration of the\nnational heritage by the President of the Republic; the\nratification of the additional protocol that amends and\nsupplements the provisions of article 7 of the protocol\nregarding the free movement of individuals and right\nof residence and of settlement, signed in Ouagadougou\non 30 June 1989; and finally, the National Committee\non Human Rights in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Several texts are\ncurrently being discussed in Parliament, and others are\nnot yet under the ambit of that institution. The latter\ninclude draft laws dealing with a revision of article 35\nof the constitution on criteria for eligibility for the\npresidency of the Republic; the legal regime for audio-\nvisual communication; the status of the opposition; the\ndeclaration of assets of elected individuals; and the\nsuppression of profiteering.\nRegarding the military, the desire for peace is\nclear. Thus, after a pause of several months, the so-\ncalled quadripartite meetings, which bring together the\ndefence and security forces and the armed forces of the\nForces nouvelles under the aegis of impartial forces,\nthat is, the United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\n(UNOCI) and Operation Licorne, have resumed.\nAthletic events have been taking place recently\nbetween the national armed forces and those of the\nForces nouvelles in an atmosphere of fraternity and\ngood cheer. It should be recalled that, since 4 July\n2003, the Government forces and the armed forces of\nthe Forces nouvelles have signed an agreement\nmarking the end of the war, and this agreement has\nbeen respected since then. I would also like to\nemphasize that, according to the commander of the\nUNOCI military force, more than 90 per cent of the\ntroops of the United Nations peacekeeping force are\nalready deployed in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. All that is needed\nnow is military logistics support for this force to be\nentirely operational.\nRegarding the redeployment of the administration\nin those areas which have been subjected to war, this\noperation is gradually continuing, to the satisfaction of\nlocal populations, particularly in the west of the\ncountry.\nAs to alleged human rights violations following\nthe crisis, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has, out of a concern to combat\nimpunity, above all, indicated its will to be open to all\nvisits or investigations \u2014 which, in fact, it has itself\nrequested \u2014 in order to appropriately asses the\nsituation. In this regard, I can state that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nreceived a visit in January and February 2004 from the\nspecial rapporteurs on freedom of opinion and\nexpression, the elimination of racial discrimination and\nmigrants and mercenaries. During their missions, they\nhad full and total cooperation from the authorities in\n25\n\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The same is true for the international\ncommission of inquiry into allegations of violations of\nhuman rights of 25 and 26 March 2004, and the\nnational commission of inquiry set up in June 2004 to\nshed light on all alleged human rights violations\ncommitted in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire since 19 September 2002.\nThat latter commission, which has just concluded its\nwork, should shed light on all allegations of human\nrights violations in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, including those\nrecently committed in Korhogo.\nMoreover, the National Assembly of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, for its part, has established a parliamentary\ncommission of inquiry designed to investigate the\nevents of 19 December 2002 and subsequent events, in\norder to achieve, we all hope, genuine peace and\nreconciliation. National peace and reconciliation are\nincompatible with impunity. The international\ncommunity should therefore assist C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in\nidentifying the perpetrators of human rights and\ninternational humanitarian law violations in order to\nbring them to justice before the competent authorities.\nWe are starting afresh; we can now lay down the\nburden of our past concerns to embark on the path of\nhope. All citizens of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire without exception\nare determined to silence those rivalries that only\nspawn hate and rancour and to pool our efforts in the\nservice of peace through dialogue. This is why we are\ncounting on the ongoing support of the international\ncommunity for our efforts at consolidating inter-\nIvorian dialogue, the principal means for a restoration\nof confidence, peace and national reconciliation.\nThe Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire therefore takes\nnote of the statement to the press today by the\nPresident of the Security Council on the situation in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a statement that our Government\nconsiders as a step forward to finding a rapid solution\nto the crisis. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is also counting on the\nassistance of international financial institutions and of\ndeveloped countries for the implementation of the\nnational programme of reconstruction and, in\nparticular, of disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration.\nAllow me to indicate here that the security index\nof the United Nations at its present level is\nunfortunately a factor that is not facilitating contacts\nand therefore the start of negotiations with\ninternational financial institutions. A review that would\nlower this level would be most welcome.\nI would like to take advantage of this opportunity\nto reiterate yet once again the gratitude of the people\nand the Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to the\ninternational community, in particular to France, the\nUnited States, Canada, all other friendly countries, the\nUnited Nations, the International Organization of la\nFrancophonie, the European Union, the African Union\nand ECOWAS for their invaluable contributions, which\nhave made it possible to overcome so many obstacles\nto date.\nThe situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is not preventing us\nfrom seeing what is taking place elsewhere, above all\non the African continent. The West African subregion\nis facing crises in Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Glimmers of hope for shortly\nputting an end to these situations do exist, but that\noptimism is clearly tempered by the continuation of\nsuch scourges as trafficking in children, drug\ntrafficking, trafficking in small arms, mercenaries,\nchild soldiers and terrorism, to name only these few.\nThus, the strengthening of a coordinated battle against\nthese scourges, under the aegis of ECOWAS and with\nthe assistance of the international community, is\nnecessary.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is a party to all existing conflict\nprevention and management mechanisms and intends\nto be fully involved in all initiatives undertaken to\npromote peace and stability on the global, continental\nand regional level. In that framework, it is contributing\nto the drawing up of a strategy for a pacification and\nstabilization of the West African region. The situation\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi,\nDarfur in Somalia, the Middle East, and Iraq cannot be\nignored and require sustained attention on the part of\nthe international community. They also undeniably\ndemonstrate the need for a strengthening of\nmultilateralism in the settlement of the conflicts\nbattering the world.\nRegarding a reform of the United Nations, and\nparticularly reform of the Security Council, I should\nlike to reaffirm the support of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for the\nshared African position, voiced several times here from\nthis rostrum, in favour of an expanded Security\nCouncil with two permanent seats and three other non-\npermanent seats for Africa.\nThe countries of the Third World, which must\ncope with numerous difficulties, clearly cannot achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals while 2015 is\n26\n\nrapidly approaching. However, far from being\novercome by defeatism, Africa has acquired a new\ninstrument for development, the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD), and its\nrecommendations are integrated into national and\nsubregional development and anti-poverty strategies.\nThe African continent awaits the international\ncommunity\u2019s implementation of commitments resulting\nfrom the major international conferences, in particular\nthose undertaken by the Group of Eight for NEPAD.\nI would like to conclude my remarks with an\nappeal for solidarity to all, given the numerous dangers\nthreatening peace and international security. In that\ncontext, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire urges respect for commitments\nand peace agreements concluded together by all States.\nIn the view of my country, this active and relentless\ncommitment to preventing conflicts includes at least\nthree elements: preventive diplomacy, based on a\nsystem of early warning; education for peace; and,\nfinally, the struggle against poverty in order to ensure\nsustainable development. Therefore, once the\nconditions for a peaceful existence have thus been\nfulfilled, the entire world will be able to move forward\ntowards a world of shared well-being and happiness."

        "file_text": "For\nthe second time, I have this special opportunity of\nappearing before you in the common home of the\nnations of the world. Everyone knows that we live in a\ntime of great risks and problems, but also of great\nopportunities. Allow me to refer to two challenges,\nwhich in my opinion are the most important: the lack\nof security and the existence of poverty.\nFirst of all, I must refer to the lack of security. I\nbelieve that it is obvious to everyone that the durability\nof our democratic system and the alleviation of poverty\nrequire us to provide for the security of each one of our\ncitizens. My Government is committed to that. The\nsafety of my compatriots is my first priority. I am\ncommitted to ensuring respect for human rights and,\nwithin that concept, I am even more committed to\nensuring the protection and the security of honest and\nhard-working citizens. If we all strive to provide\nsecurity and reduce our citizens\u00ed level of poverty, we\nwill also be combating terrorists, and we will be\nwinning the battle against those who take advantage of\nthe positive qualities of democracy to destroy it\nthrough terror.\nCombating terrorism begins by combating crime\nand delinquency in our countries. We are committed to\nthis struggle, and we know that we are not alone. This\nis, in fact, a universal challenge. We know that we can\nonly confront it if we are together. Crime, delinquency\nand terrorism have, in effect, already undergone\nglobalization and our actions, therefore, must be\nequally based on international cooperation.\nOrganized crime appears in many shapes and\nforms. However, few are as degrading as drug\ntrafficking. Few crimes generate as much corruption or\nso thoroughly destroy the core of our society and our\nvalues than drug trafficking. My country is on the drug\ntrafficking route. We are right in the middle of the\ncorridor that links the producers to the consumers. We\nare victims of the greed of the producers and the\nperverted desires of the consumers. Over the past 18\nmonths in Honduras, we have impounded more drugs\nthan in all the previous nine years, but this is obviously\nstill not enough. Combating organized crime and drug\ntrafficking, if we are alone, will be almost impossible.\nThe Governments of the countries in which drugs are\nproduced, the countries that are used to transport the\ndrugs and the countries in which the drugs are\nconsumed must, together, confront this. If we are\nalone, the poor countries have very few chances of\nsucceeding. If we remain alone, we will have to divert\nresources that we need to combat poverty towards\ncombating drug trafficking and organized crime. We\n7\n\nneed more resolute, direct and substantial support if we\nare to confront this tremendous challenge. I would like\nto say to the wealthy countries: let us work together to\nconfront this scourge of our time.\nSecurity also implies the rule of law and, for over\nthree years, we have worked to bring it about. We have\ncombated corruption by closing businesses that\nengaged in tax evasion, eliminated the immunity of\npublic servants and promoted a responsible use of State\nresources. We have achieved a great deal, but we\nrecognize that a great deal remains to be done. We\nrecently adopted a property law, which, for the first\ntime in our history, enables the poor to hold deeds to\ntheir land. This may seem simple and almost trivial in\ndeveloped countries, but on our continent, by and\nlarge, the poor have not enjoyed the benefit of these\nvaluable deeds. Eighty-four per cent of Honduras\u00ed\ncitizens do not have a title to the plot of land on which\nthey live. We are opening new pathways, and before\nmy Government completes its mandate, we hope that\nhundreds of thousands of poor people will hold, for the\nfirst time, registered titles to their property.\nSecurity also implies peaceful relationships with\nour neighbours. For the first time in our history, our\nland borders have been defined, and they are now\nbeing conclusively demarcated. What is even more\nimportant is that this was achieved without spilling\nblood and without bellicose threats. We resorted to the\nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague and we\nhave complied with its rulings. As far as Honduras is\nconcerned, solving a border dispute is not something\nthat can be achieved through violence. It can be achieved\npeacefully, through international jurisprudence.\nHaving now consolidated our land borders, we\nare defining our maritime borders, and we have once\nagain had recourse to the International Court of Justice.\nIn our opinion, the time has now come to take the\nnext step. The time has come to declare Central America\na zone of peace, a zone that renounces violence as a\nmeans of resolving disputes. To consolidate this\nprocess with the support of the Organization of\nAmerican States, we have already eliminated all the\nlandmines that were placed around our country years\nago, and we can now say with pride that we are a\ncountry that is entirely free of landmines. To bring this\nprocess to completion, we now propose reducing the\nnumber of weapons of war throughout the region. To\nlend credibility to this process, we invite the United\nNations to accompany us and to certify compliance on\nthe part of each of our countries. We also invite the\ninternational community to join us in this process.\nWe propose that the process of arms reduction be\nsupported with fresh resources to combat poverty. We\npropose an exchange: weapons of war in exchange for\nfunding for poverty alleviation. Please support us.\nPoverty, and even more, hunger and malnutrition, are\nthe most fearsome enemies of our democratic systems.\nA democracy based on empty stomachs is an empty\ndemocracy. All the research that has been carried out,\nincluding studies by the United Nations, tell us that,\ntoday as never before, formal democracy prevails\nthroughout our continent, in Latin America. However,\nthe same studies tell us that, today more than ever,\ndissatisfaction with our democratic systems is rampant.\nPoverty undermines our democracies and hunger\nerodes them. We know that combating poverty and\nhunger is an effort that must be shared by all. In our\ncase, in Honduras, with much participation on the part\nof our citizens, we have devised a strategy to combat\npoverty that incorporates the Millennium Development\nGoals. This legacy has been refined and perfected over\nthe past two years. The strategy to combat poverty is\nthe very foundation of our vision as a country and of\nour planning as a nation.\nHowever, alone and in isolation, our efforts\nundoubtedly will not be able to produce the hoped-for\nresults for our people. We require the support of the\ninternational community. International cooperation is\nnot a handout; it is an investment. Everyone, absolutely\neveryone, derives benefit from it. Our small economies\nare open to international trade and to globalization. We\ndo not fear this challenge; in fact, we see that it\nprovides tremendous opportunities to us.\nHowever, we will not be able to overcome our\npoverty if the rules of international trade are not fair.\nWe firmly believe that protected markets lead only to\nstagnation and the growth of poverty. It is not fair that\nwhile we are opening our markets, other countries are\ngiving subsidies to their producers.\nWe welcome the decision of the United States to\nreturn to the International Coffee Organization, but at\nthe same time we ask that the hundreds of thousands of\nfamilies that grow coffee in rural areas be paid better.\nLet me give you an example. Five years ago, our\nfarmers earned 40 per cent of the price of coffee served\nto the final consumer. Today, they earn only 9 per cent,\n8\n\nwhile the companies in developed countries pocket the\ndifference. I invite the presidents and heads of State of\ncoffee-producing countries to work together until we\nachieve a better price for all of our farmers. Together,\nproducers and consumers, we can make sure that coffee\nis not a bitter drink for the producers.\nIf the price of coffee can have a rapid and\nmassive impact on the struggle against poverty, the\nprice of oil, when it rises, rapidly makes our poverty\nmuch worse. In the case of my country, over the past\nyear the increased bill for oil is 12 times what we\nspend on providing school lunches to 870,000 boys and\ngirls who used to go to school without eating every\nday. This is 12 times what it took us years and many\nsacrifices to achieve. The world has seldom seen so\nmassive a transfer of resources from poor importing\ncountries to wealthy oil-exporting countries.\nI would like to take this opportunity to appeal to\ninternational conscience, and in particular to the\nconscience of oil-exporting countries, that we may\nestablish a trading system that brings about a reduction\nin the price of oil and helps to stabilize it. We need a\nsystem that takes account of poverty in countries and\nof the efforts that are being made to combat it. We need\na system that enjoys United Nations supervision to\nensure that it is used properly.\nI am making a formal request to the United\nNations to take the lead in this matter. I am not\nexaggerating when I say that there are few other\nactions we could take that would make such a great\ncontribution to reducing poverty. I would also like to\nappeal to the developed countries to use oil like a\nscarce resource. Let them continue to improve fuel\nefficiency and to establish taxes that reflect the true\ncost of oil. Let them coordinate measures to make sure\nthat demand does not grow unduly and make prices\ngrow too fast. They should make prudent use of a non-\nrenewable resource to which we should all have access.\nI would like to conclude by appealing to all to\nstrengthen the United Nations system. That is the only\nway we can achieve peace in the world. Let us\nsubordinate our individual agendas in order to find\nagreed solutions here in the United Nations. The well-\nbeing of the world demands that we act in this manner.\nI would also add that we support reforming the\nSecurity Council by increasing the number of\npermanent and non-permanent members. This will\nmake it possible for countries such as Japan to\nparticipate, as well as a representative for Latin\nAmerica. This will lend greater legitimacy to the\nCouncil\u00eds decisions. We also support an all-embracing\napproach for the United Nations, which, in our opinion,\nmeans that we should find a way of enabling the\nChinese people in Taiwan to participate in the United\nNations processes.\nAs I said at the beginning, we are living in difficult\ntimes, but this is also a time of great opportunity. We\nhold out our hand in friendship to everyone. All that\nwe ask in exchange is to be treated fairly."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset\nto extend my congratulations to you, Mr. Jean Ping, on\nyour election as President of the fifty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly, and to express my conviction\nthat this session will be concluded successfully under\nyour presidency. Moreover, I take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the President of the fifty-eighth session,\nMr. Julian Hunte, on his dedication and on the\nsuccessful fulfilment of his responsibilities.\nLast year was extremely challenging, for both the\nworld community and the United Nations. In that\nregard, I would like to commend Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for his efforts and contributions in\npreserving peace in the world. In his recent address\n(see ), he clearly demonstrated once again\nhis dedication to the cause of the Organization.\nWe certainly all agree that the United Nations\ncontinues to be the most relevant global forum\naddressing international peacekeeping and security\nissues. We also agree on the need to renew and reform\nits bodies and agendas in order to preserve the vital\nrole of the Organization. In that context, we look\nforward to reading the report being drafted by the\nHigh-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\nwhich was created by the Secretary-General.\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council,\nthe Republic of Macedonia considers it extremely\nimportant to increase the membership of the Council with\nregard to both permanent and non-permanent seats.\nThe renewal and strengthening of the role of the\nEconomic and Social Council is equally relevant. The\nRepublic of Macedonia has presented its candidacy for\nthe election to the Economic and Social Council to be\nheld during this session. We are confident that, if\nelected and with the support of the General Assembly,\nmy country will be able to make its full contribution to\nimproving the efficiency of the Council.\nAs far as the revitalization of the General\nAssembly is concerned, we think that we must seize\nthe momentum, implement the provisions of the\nrevised agenda and pursue efforts to make the work of\nthe Main Committees more focused and rational.\nUnfortunately, once again this year, inhuman acts\nof terrorism have continued to take innocent lives and\nto preoccupy world public opinion. We were all\nhorrified by the images of human suffering in Madrid,\nBeslan and elsewhere. In order to enhance the capacity\nof the international community in this respect, we need\nto further consolidate the world anti-terrorist coalition\nled by the United Nations and, additionally, strengthen\ncooperation with regional organizations that have\nspecific mechanisms to fight this global evil.\nThe Republic of Macedonia will continue its active\ncooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee of\nthe Security Council and make its own contribution to\nthe implementation of resolution 1373 (2001). In that\nregard, I would like to inform the Assembly that, last\nMay, the Republic of Macedonia ratified the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism and the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nremains one of the major threats to international peace\nand security, and it is closely related to terrorism. We\nwelcome the Security Council\u2019s adoption of resolution\n1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction. The implementation of that\nresolution will complement the existing set of\ninstruments and consolidate the role of the Security\nCouncil in this area.\nThe suppression of the illicit trade in small arms\nand light weapons and the total prohibition of anti-\npersonnel mines are also very important issues, given\nthe size of the problem and the number of victims\ncaused by mines. Doing so will contribute greatly to\nconflict prevention and successful peacekeeping and\npeace-building throughout the world, including our\nregion. At the end of last year, the Republic of\nMacedonia conducted a successful effort to collect\nsmall arms and light weapons. That effort had the\nsupport of the United Nations Development\nProgramme. Efforts in this regard are ongoing.\nWe expect that the first review conference of\ncountries parties to the Ottawa Convention, which is to\nbe held in Nairobi, will produce a summary of the\nresults achieved through the implementation of that\nextremely important instrument, which will pave the\nway to the creation of a world free of landmines.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has destroyed its\nmine stockpiles and is working on the demining of\naffected regions. The United Nations Mine Action\nService, together with the International Trust Fund for\n5\n\nDemining and Mine Victims Assistance, have provided\na great deal of help in our demining activities.\nUnfortunately, violent conflicts have continued\nthis year. The armed conflict in Darfur and the terrible\nhumanitarian tragedy it brought about require decisive\naction. We support the Security Council resolution in\nthis regard, and we join the call for further and urgent\naction on this matter.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to\nkeep the world on edge. We support the efforts of the\nQuartet to find a solution acceptable to all sides and we\nshare the conviction that the road map is the only way\nto reach a solution for Palestine and Israel, two\nneighbouring States that will one day live in peace.\nBuilding peace and fostering democracy in\nAfghanistan and Iraq, where the Republic of\nMacedonia is part of the multinational force, remains a\nchallenge facing both the international community and\nthe peoples of those two countries. I would like to\nemphasize the exceptional importance of the\nimplementation of resolution 1546 (2004), which\nendorsed the restoration of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and\nprovided the core framework for the political\ntransformation and democratization of that State.\nWith regard to Iraq, I would like to appeal to the\nauthorities of that country to do their utmost to find the\nthree Macedonian citizens who have disappeared there.\nThe Millennium Development Goals remain the\nkey challenge for the Organization. In September 2005,\nheads of State and Government from around the world\nwill meet to review what has been done in realizing the\nGoals in the five years since the adoption of the\nMillennium Summit Declaration. It is crystal clear that\nwe must take decisive steps if we want to mobilize\npolitical will and resources and carry out reforms on the\nnational and global levels to meet the Goals by 2015.\nHowever, it is already clear that some regions of\nthe world will find it very difficult to achieve the\nprojected Goals. Special attention should be dedicated\nto Africa, where the situation is alarming and the issues\nof poverty and hunger eradication and the problem of\nAIDS are very serious. Achieving the Goals will not be\npossible unless the international community is ready to\nassume its share of responsibility in that respect.\nThe Republic of Macedonia places special\nemphasis on the importance of effective respect for,\nand promotion of, human rights as one of the pillars of\nevery democratic society. The rule of law and effective\nrespect for human rights are the best instrument in\npreventing conflicts, as well as prerequisites for peace\nand prosperity. Today, we are increasingly aware of the\nneed to nurture and respect multiculturalism as a\nprecondition to the development of a secure and\nharmonious world. In that regard, every effort should\nbe made to create mutual confidence and understanding\nand to promote respect for differences. The Republic of\nMacedonia is deeply committed to those principles,\nand we adhere to them strictly in our actions.\nFor half a century now, the United Nations has\nhad a key role in the development of international\nhuman rights law. In that context, we welcome current\nefforts to harmonize the draft international convention\nto protect the rights of disabled persons.\nGood-neighbourly relations are one of the foreign\npolicy priorities of the Republic of Macedonia, as one\nof the promoters of regional cooperation in South-East\nEurope. I would like to take this opportunity to inform\nthe Assembly that, as during previous sessions, the\ndelegation of the Republic of Macedonia will propose\nthe adoption by the General Assembly of a draft\nresolution on good-neighbourly relations, stability and\ndevelopment in South-Eastern Europe.\nIn recent years, the countries of the region have\nmade considerable progress at both the domestic level\nand in developing mutual relations. We are actively\ncooperating in numerous regional initiatives and in the\nframework of the Euro-Atlantic integration process.\nHowever, despite the considerable progress made at the\nlevel of stabilization and improved security in the\nregion, not all sources of potential instability have been\neliminated. We strongly believe that the process of the\nregion\u2019s accelerated integration into the European\nUnion and NATO will weaken existing threats at the\nnational and regional levels.\nAs an immediate neighbouring country, the\nRepublic of Macedonia is following with particular\nattention the developments in Kosovo. We fully\nsupport the United Nations policy of standards before\nstatus, whose final goal is to establish a true multi-\nethnic community and to improve security,\ndemocratization and the rule of law. At the same time,\nthe Republic of Macedonia is also lending its\ncontinued support to the United Nations and other\ninternational bodies as they carry out their responsible\nmissions.\n6\n\nWe have developed contractual cooperation with\nthe United Nations Interim Administration Mission in\nKosovo in various areas, with a view to resolving\nconcrete issues that are relevant to the population. We\nexpect very soon to start the process of the demarcation\nof our border with Kosovo. Also with regard to\nKosovo, I would like to emphasize the fact that any\ndecision on its future status must not result in the\ndestabilization of the region.\nThe Republic of Macedonia is going through a\ncritical stage in the process of carrying out\nfundamental economic and social reforms and\ntransforming its society to prepare it for accelerated\nintegration into the European Union. The finalization\nof the implementation of the framework agreement\nconcluded in 2001 is a priority in that process. Most of\nthe legal regulations resulting from the constitutional\nchanges flowing from the framework agreement have\nalready been adopted. Nevertheless, one of the main\nissues pertaining to decentralization \u2014 namely,\nterritorial reorganization \u2014 could pose a challenge,\ngiven the upcoming referendum. That referendum is a\ndemocratic event of the highest order that provides\ncitizens with an opportunity to express their opinions\non the concept being put forth by the Government.\nFinally, I would like to conclude by saying that\nthe world is facing a range of challenges and threats,\nbut that our experience so far has proven that there is\nno alternative to the multilateral approach to\novercoming threats to international peace and security.\nOur experience has also proven that dialogue remains\nthe most valuable and powerful instrument in our\nendeavours to create a different and safer world."

        "file_text": "Every year at the United Nations, we go through the\nsame ritual. We attend the general debate knowing\nbeforehand that the clamour for justice and peace by\nour underdeveloped countries will be ignored once\nagain. However, we persist. We know that we are right.\nWe know that one day we will accomplish social\njustice and development. We also know that such assets\nwill not be given away to us. We know that the peoples\nwill have to seize them from those who deny us justice\ntoday, because they underpin their wealth and\narrogance with disdain for our grief. It will not be\nalways like that, however. We say so today with more\nconviction than ever before.\nHaving said this, and knowing as we do that some\npowerful ones \u2014 just a few \u2014 present here will be\nchagrined, and also knowing that they are shared by\nmany, Cuba will now tell some truths.\nFirst, after the aggression on Iraq, there is no\nUnited Nations, understood as a useful and diverse\nforum based on respect for the rights of all and with\nguarantees for the small States. It is experiencing the\nworst moment of its nearly 60 years. It languishes, it\ngasps for air, it keeps up appearances, but it does not\nwork. Who handcuffed the United Nations, named by\nPresident Roosevelt? President Bush.\nSecond, United States troops will have to be\nwithdrawn from Iraq. Now that the lives of over 1,000\nAmerican youths have been uselessly sacrificed to\nserve the spurious interests of a clique of cronies and\nbuddies, and following the deaths of more than 12,000\nIraqis, it is clear that the only way out for the occupier\nfaced with a people in revolt is to recognize the\nimpossibility of subduing them and to withdraw. In\nspite of the imperial monopoly over information,\npeoples always get to the truth. Someday, those\nresponsible and their accomplices will have to deal\nwith the consequences of their actions in the face of\nhistory and their own peoples.\nThird, for the time being, there will be no valid,\nreal and useful reform of the United Nations. It would\ntake the super-Power, which inherited the immense\nprerogative of governing an order conceived for a\nbipolar world, to relinquish its privileges. And it will\nnot do so.\n33\n\nAs of now, we know that the anachronistic\nprivilege of the veto will remain; that the Security\nCouncil will not be democratized as it should be or\nexpanded to include third world countries; that the\nGeneral Assembly will continue to stand ignored; and\nthat, at the United Nations, there will be more actions\ndriven by the interests imposed by the super-Power and\nits allies. We, as non-aligned countries, will have to\nentrench ourselves in defending the United Nations\nCharter, because if we do not it will be redrafted with\nthe deletion of every trace of such principles as the\nsovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the\nnon-use or the threat of use of force.\nFourth, the powerful collude to divide us. The\n130-plus underdeveloped countries must build a\ncommon front for the defence of the sacred interests of\nour peoples and of our right to development and peace.\nLet us revitalize the Non-Aligned Movement. Let us\nstrengthen the Group of 77.\nFifth, the modest objectives of the Millennium\nDeclaration will not be accomplished. We will reach\nthe fifth anniversary of the Summit in a situation that\nhas worsened. We sought to halve by 2015 the 1.276\nbillion human beings in abject poverty that existed in\n1990. There would have to be a yearly reduction of\nmore than 46 million poor people. However, excluding\nChina, between 1990 and 2000, extreme poverty rose\nby 28 million people. Poverty does not decline, it\ngrows.\nWe wanted to reduce by half by 2015 the 842\nmillion hungry people in the world. There would have\nhad to be a yearly reduction of 28 million. However,\nthere has been a reduction of barely 2.1 million hungry\npeople per year. At this rate, the goal will be attained\nby 2215, two hundred years after what was envisaged,\nand only if our species survives the destruction of its\nenvironment.\nWe proclaimed the aspiration to achieve universal\nprimary education by 2015. However, more than 120\nmillion children \u2014 or 1 in every 5 children of school\nage \u2014 do not attend primary school. According to the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), at the\ncurrent rate, the goal will be achieved after 2100.\nWe also proposed to reduce by two thirds the\nmortality rate in children under the age of five. The\nreduction has been symbolic: whereas 86 children died\nper 1,000 live births in 1998, the figure is now 82.\nEvery year, 11 million children continue to die of\ndiseases that can be prevented or cured, and their\nparents rightfully wonder what our meetings are for.\nWe said that we would pay attention to Africa\u2019s\nspecial needs. However, very little has been done.\nAfrican nations do not need foreign advice or models,\nbut rather financial resources and access to markets\nand technologies. Assisting Africa would not be an act\nof charity, but an act of justice, a settling of the historic\ndebt resulting from centuries of exploitation and\npillage.\nWe committed ourselves to halting and starting to\nreverse the AIDS epidemic by 2015. However, in 2003,\nit claimed nearly 3 million lives. At this rate, some 36\nmillion people will have died of this disease by 2015.\nSixth, creditor countries and the international\nfinancial agencies will not seek a just and lasting\nsolution to foreign debt. They prefer to keep us in\ndebt \u2014 in other words, vulnerable. Therefore, even\nthough we have paid off $4.1 trillion in debt servicing\nover the last 13 years, our debt has increased from $1.4\ntrillion to $2.6 trillion. This means that we have paid\nthree times what we owed and now our debt is twice as\nlarge.\nSeventh, we, the underdeveloped countries, are\nthe ones that finance the wastefulness and the opulence\nof developed countries. While in 2003 they gave us\n$68.4 billion in official development assistance (ODA),\nwe delivered $436 billion to them as payment for the\nforeign debt. Who is helping whom?\nEighth, the fight against terrorism can only be\nwon through cooperation among all nations, with\nrespect for international law, and not through massive\nbombings or pre-emptive wars against dark corners of\nthe world. We must put an end to hypocrisy and double\nstandards. Sheltering three Cuban-born terrorists in the\nUnited States is an act complicit with terrorism.\nPunishing five young Cuban antiterrorists, together\nwith their families, is a crime.\nNinth, general and complete disarmament,\nincluding nuclear disarmament, is impossible today. It\nis the responsibility of a group of developed countries\nthat are the ones that sell and buy the most weapons.\nHowever, we must continue to strive for this goal. We\nmust demand that the over $900 billion set aside every\nyear for military expenditures be used for\ndevelopment.\n34\n\nTenth, the financial resources to guarantee the\nsustainable development of all peoples on the planet\nare available, but what is lacking is the political will of\nthose who rule the world. A development tax of merely\n0.1 per cent on international financial transactions\nwould generate resources amounting to almost $400\nbillion a year. The cancellation of the foreign debt\nincurred by underdeveloped countries would allow\nthem to have no less than $436 billion a year available\nfor their development, money which is currently used\nto pay off the constantly-rising debt. If developed\ncountries complied with their commitment to set aside\n0.7 per cent of their gross national product as ODA,\nand not 0.2 per cent as they currently do, their\ncontribution would increase from the current $68.4\nbillion to $160 billion a year.\nLastly, I want to clearly express Cuba\u2019s profound\nconviction that the 6.4 billion human beings on this\nplanet \u2014 who have equal rights according to the\nUnited Nations Charter \u2014 urgently require a new order\nin which the world is not in suspense, as is the case\nnow, awaiting the outcome of the elections in a new\nRome, in which only half the voters will participate\nand nearly $1.5 billion will be spent.\nThere is no discouragement in our words; I must\nmake that clear. We are optimistic, because we are\nrevolutionaries. We have faith in the struggle of the\npeoples, and we are sure that we will achieve a new\nworld order based on respect for the rights of all \u2014 an\norder based on solidarity, justice and peace, resulting\nfrom the best of universal culture, not from mediocrity\nor brute force.\nWith regard to Cuba \u2014 and neither blockades,\nthreats, hurricanes, droughts, nor human or natural\nforce can divert it from its course \u2014 I shall say\nnothing. On 28 October, for the thirteenth time, the\nGeneral Assembly will discuss and vote on a draft\nresolution on the blockade against the Cuban people.\nOnce again, morality and principles will defeat\narrogance and force.\nI conclude by recalling the words spoken here 25\nyears ago by President Fidel Castro:\n\u201cThe clashing of weapons, the threatening\nlanguage and the overbearing behaviour in the\ninternational arena must cease. Enough of the\nillusion that the problems of the world can be\nsolved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the\nhungry, the sick and the ignorant; but bombs\ncannot kill hunger, disease and ignorance. Nor\ncan bombs kill the righteous rebellion of the\npeoples.\u201d "

        "file_text": "Two years\nago I had the great satisfaction of personally\nwitnessing, in this very Hall, Switzerland\u2019s entry into\nthe United Nations. I will never forget the whole-\nhearted welcome that Switzerland received on that\noccasion.\nSwitzerland\u2019s accession to the United Nations\ntook place at a time when the fight against terrorism\ndominated international debate and divergences in\nopinion on how to proceed with respect to Iraq were\nwidening. Dissension arose once again within the\nSecurity Council. That experience showed that any\naction taken in the absence of a mandate that is clearly\ndefined in a Security Council resolution is doomed to\nfailure. Such actions can only result in differences of\nopinion that reduce the effectiveness of the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts and jeopardize\ninternational security.\nWhen all is said and done, however, the Iraq\ncrisis has made clear that the international community\nremains committed to a multilateral system for\nmaintaining international peace and security, but that\nthe structures currently in place are no longer\nappropriate.\nThere is now, therefore, a clear need for reform\nand for strengthening the means of joint action. The\nHigh-Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General\nto make recommendations for ensuring effective joint\naction is a first step on the road to reform. Switzerland\nactively supports that initiative.\nThus, this past spring, we invited a group of\nexperts to discuss the subject of the right of self-\ndefence, and in that context, the role of the Security\nCouncil. Their conclusion was that it is neither\nnecessary nor desirable to extend or reinterpret the\nright of individual self-defence set out in the Charter.\nWhat we must do is strengthen joint action; that is the\nissue on which we must focus.\nIn this context, prevention is essential. On the one\nhand, we must ensure improved living conditions\nthroughout the world; on the other, multilateral\ninstitutions must respond more rapidly to nascent\ncrises.\n17\n\nA more rapid response does not necessarily mean\nmilitary intervention. Switzerland has always held the\nview that force must remain an instrument of last\nresort. Apart from situations of self-defence, force may\nbe used only with the approval of the Security Council\nand when other methods of persuasion or pressure have\nbeen exhausted.\nA more rapid response also means that the\nSecurity Council must fully exercise its primary\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\nsecurity, which is conferred upon it by the Charter.\nThis raises the issue of the legitimacy of action of the\nSecurity Council and, in particular, the question of its\ncomposition. After more than 10 years of deliberation\non that issue, it is time we found a solution. The\ncomposition of the Security Council must better reflect\nthe changes that have taken place in the international\ncontext since its creation, and developing countries\nmust have a greater role to play. Greater account must\nbe taken of the financial and material contributions of\nspecific Member States.\nOn the other hand, Switzerland is opposed to the\ncreation of new seats with the right of veto, because\nthe right of veto in its current form is undemocratic and\nhampers the capacity of the Security Council to act. In\nthe interests of greater legitimacy, those countries that\nare not members of the Security Council should have\nmore opportunity to participate in the decision-making\nprocess. In particular, it is important to strengthen\nmechanisms for consultation with countries directly\ninvolved in situations of tension.\nReforming institutions may be an arduous and\nunrewarding task, but it is indispensable for increasing\nthe efficiency of the United Nations and for promoting\npeace. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for\nthe work that he has already done and encourage him\nto continue along the same path.\nOver and above institutional aspects, the\ncommitment of Member States is critical if the United\nNations is to be effective. First of all, if it is to remain\ncredible, the United Nations and its Member States\nmust be the unassailable guarantors of international\nlaw and, in particular, international humanitarian law. I\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for having emphasized today the absolute\nprimacy of the rule of law \u2014 a source a strength for\nthe weak. Switzerland will continue to insist that\nrespect for the rule of law is the only practical way\nforward. In the absence of a political solution to the\nconflict in Darfur, for example, civilians have become\nthe victims of attacks that constitute a serious violation\nof international humanitarian law \u2014 a violation which\nmust be punished by the appropriate national and, if\nnecessary, international, bodies.\nFor that reason, too, following the adoption of\nresolution ES-10/15 on the advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice \u2014 which found that the\nconstruction of the separation barrier in the occupied\nPalestinian territory by Israel is contrary to\ninternational law \u2014 Switzerland accepts, in its\ncapacity as depositary of the Geneva Conventions, the\nmandate to conduct consultations on ways and means\nfor the parties concerned to achieve greater respect for\ninternational humanitarian law.\nIf it is to be strong, the United Nations must be\nable to rely on those States with the necessary\nresources to help it carry out its tasks. All of those\ncountries, including my own, are called upon to\nprovide the personnel and materials needed by\npeacekeeping missions. The appalling attack on the\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad underscores\nthe need to give special consideration to the security of\nthe United Nations and its staff. Fortunately, additional\nsecurity measures are now in place. Other measures\nmust follow. It is our shared duty to ensure that the\nSecretary-General has the necessary financial resources\nat his disposal.\nAs I said earlier, prevention will depend on the\nfight against poverty. In autumn next year, we plan to\ngather together to undertake the first assessment of the\nstate of progress on the Millennium Development\nGoals. We must already admit that our efforts have\nbeen inadequate. Of course, every country has its\nbudgetary constraints. But we also have a duty to keep\nthe promises we made at the dawn of the millennium.\nPresident Lula da Silva made this point earlier,\nforcefully and with commitment. He recalled our\nresponsibility to history \u2014 which we endorse \u2014 to\neliminate poverty while we have the means to do so.\nIn that context, I welcome the fact that trade\nliberalization within the framework of the Doha Round\nregained some momentum this summer in Geneva.\nDifficult negotiations still lie ahead of us \u2014\nnegotiations that must seek to meet expectations that\nare sometimes contradictory. Switzerland intends to\nplay a constructive role, and I call on all our partners to\n18\n\ncommit themselves to ensure the early success of the\ndevelopment round.\nPrevention will require us to both detect and\ndefuse today the problems of tomorrow. I believe that\nour efforts to promote peace must be rapidly fleshed\nout in two areas. The first of these is conflict that is\nborne of religion. Killing is unacceptable, and it is\nespecially so if it is carried out for religious reasons.\nYet increasingly frequently, religion is becoming the\nonly frame of reference for analysing political and\nsocial problems. Such an extreme simplification of\nreality runs the risk of heightening tension. The\ninternational community must find a solution, and the\nUnited Nations is the ideal forum in which to do so.\nThe second area is environmental preservation.\nThe increasing scarcity of resources is sowing the\nseeds of conflict over appropriation and distribution.\nSustainable development must not be allowed to\nbecome an empty concept. Our actions to date within\nthe context of the United Nations have not been\nsufficient to enable us to fulfil our responsibilities\ntowards future generations. Devoting more time to\nseeking agreement on the Kyoto Protocol than the\nfounding fathers took to draft the Charter of the United\nNations is beneath our dignity.\nThe United Nations will be judged by its success\nin meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThe institutional reforms now under way are a step in\nthe right direction. It is up to us, the Member States,\nresolutely to commit ourselves to promote peace and to\nmake the United Nations the instrument for carrying\nout that essential task."

        "file_text": "Allow\nme at the outset to join previous speakers in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its current session. In light\nof the restraints on our time, I shall omit several\nacknowledgements and tributes that I should have liked\nto make and delve directly into matters of vital\nimportance to my country, to the region of the Horn of\nAfrica and, by extension, to all Member States of our\nglobal community.\nMy Government, of course, recognizes and is\ngrateful for the vital contributions of the international\ncommunity, including the United Nations, to promote\npeace in the aftermath of the war that Ethiopia declared\nagainst my country, using a place called Badme as a\npretext for invasion.\nThe Algiers Peace Agreement, signed by the two\nparties in December 2000, was drafted and brokered by\nthe United States, the European Union, the African\nUnion and Algeria, among others. Furthermore, the\ninternational community has spent more than $700\nmillion to date to maintain the peacekeeping force.\nMore than 37 countries have contributed military\npersonnel, which are involved in UNMEE in various\ncapacities. We are indeed grateful for those\ncontributions.\nBut, while we applaud those valuable\ncontributions, we are duty-bound to express, with equal\ncandour, our regret and dismay at the lack of resolute\naction by the international community at this critical\ntime, when the entire process is on the brink of\ncollapse. Had the international community respected its\nobligations and seen the process through with the\nrequisite seriousness, the border would have been\ndemarcated long ago. Today could have been an\nauspicious moment for our peoples to celebrate, from\nthis rostrum, the resounding success of the United\nNations peacekeeping effort. Instead, the dark clouds\nof war are once again gathering over my country\nbecause of Ethiopia\u2019s intransigence and the\nacquiescence of major Powers as concerns Ethiopia\u2019s\nviolations of international law.\nAllow me to recall some of the most salient tenets\nof the Algiers Peace Agreement (A/55/686, annex).\nFirst, regarding the establishment and powers of\nthe Arbitration Commission, article 4.2 of the\nAgreement states:\n\u201cThe parties agree that a neutral Boundary\nCommission composed of five members shall be\nestablished with a mandate to delimit and\ndemarcate the colonial treaty boundary based on\npertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902 and 1908)\nand applicable international law. The\nCommission shall not have the power to make\ndecisions ex aequo et bono.\u201d\nSecondly, as concerns the final and binding\nnature of the decision, article 4.15 states:\n11\n\n\u201cThe parties agree that the delimitation and\ndemarcation determinations of the Commission\nshall be final and binding. Each party shall\nrespect the border so determined, as well as the\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the other\nparty.\u201d\nThirdly, regarding punitive measures that should\nbe taken against the violating party, paragraph 14 of\nthe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (S/2000/601,\nannex) states:\n\u201c[The] OAU and the United Nations commit\nthemselves to guarantee the respect for this\ncommitment of the two parties until the\ndetermination of the common border \u2026 This\nguarantee shall be comprised of\na) Measures to be taken by the\ninternational community should one or both\nof the parties violate this commitment,\nincluding appropriate measures to be taken\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations by the United Nations\nSecurity Council.\u201d\nIt has been more than two years now since the\nBoundary Commission announced its decision on the\nbasis of the Algiers Peace Agreement. That legal\ndecision was reached after 15 months of litigation,\nfollowing the exchange of numerous memorandums\nand a two-week verbal hearing. The decision is final\nand binding in accordance with the aforementioned\nPeace Agreement. Furthermore, the decision is based\non the fundamental African principle of the\ninviolability of inherited colonial boundaries, which\nare not of our making but which we can only respect\nunless we wish to open the Pandora\u2019s box of an endless\ncycle of bloody border conflicts.\nMy Government has accepted in good faith the\nBoundary Commission\u2019s decision, not because it has\nwon in the litigation, but because we firmly believe\nthat the only way to secure an enduring peace is\nthrough respect of the rule of law and the integrity of\nthe arbitration decision. That is why my Government\nhas been cooperating, and continues to cooperate, fully\nand unreservedly with the Boundary Commission in all\nits delimitation decisions and demarcation instructions.\nEthiopia, on the other hand, has categorically\nrejected the decision of the Boundary Commission. In\na letter to the Security Council on 19 September last\nyear, the Ethiopian Prime Minister declared that the\nwork of the Commission was \u201cin terminal crisis\u201d. The\nPrime Minister dismissed the decision of the Boundary\nCommission as totally illegal, unjust and irresponsible,\nand requested the Security Council to set up an\nalternative mechanism to demarcate the contested parts\nof the boundary.\nEthiopia, of course, has no reason whatsoever to\nreject the Boundary Commission decision. Apart from\nits treaty obligations, the fact is that Ethiopia has won,\nby its own admission, extra territories that never\nbelonged to it. Those were the words of the Prime\nMinister, the Foreign Minister and the Council of\nMinisters on 13 April 2002, when the Boundary\nCommission announced its decision.\nEthiopia\u2019s belated and calculated rejection of the\ndecision was an afterthought. It was tentative and\ncautious at first, but gained boldness and audacity\nwhen it realized that it could do so with impunity. The\nPrime Minister\u2019s letter informing the Security Council\nthat Ethiopia totally rejected the decision of the\nBoundary Commission was written 16 full months after\nthe decision was rendered. In a sense, Ethiopia\u2019s\nrejection has more to do with the conduct of the\ninternational community rather than any intrinsic\nproblem of the decision itself.\nCritical and encouraging factors in Ethiopia\u2019s\nrejection were the sympathetic dispositions towards it\nand the \u201cwinks and nods\u201d of certain countries and\nsome foreign missions in Ethiopia.\nEthiopia\u2019s current arguments and excuses on the\nneed to factor in human and physical geography and\nbogus concerns as to population dislocation or\nseparation of villages and homes are so fallacious as to\nnot even merit discussion. The legal basis for\ndelimiting the boundary is unequivocal, and Ethiopia\ncannot inject new elements after the fact. Furthermore,\nboundaries in Africa, and for that matter elsewhere in\nthe world, are not always carved out of natural rivers\nand ravines to exclude contiguous villages lying on\neither side of the boundary between two countries.\nIn the case of the Eritrea-Ethiopia boundary, in\n1998 Ethiopia expelled 14,500 Eritreans who had\ninhabited 39 villages on the eastern part of the Badme\nline since the 1920s. Those people have spent the last\nseveral years in makeshift camps in western Eritrea.\nAn additional 58,000 Eritreans remain displaced\nbecause Ethiopia continues to occupy our sovereign\n12\n\nterritories. All in all, more than 90,000 Eritreans, and\nEthiopians of Eritrean origin, were expelled from\nEthiopia in 1998 because the Ethiopian Prime Minister\ndeclared that \u201cEthiopia has every right to expel any\nforeign citizen if it does not like the colour of their\neyes\u201d. How can Ethiopia now invoke the possible\ndislocation of a few thousand settlers to prevent\ndemarcation of the boundary and jeopardize regional\npeace?\nIn spite of Ethiopia\u2019s violations of the Peace\nAgreements, major Powers within the international\ncommunity have not taken critical steps to persuade\nEthiopia to uphold the rule of law and abide by its\ntreaty obligations. On the contrary, Ethiopia is\ncontinuing to obtain massive humanitarian, economic\nand military support from major Powers. Full-fledged\neconomic sanctions may not have been necessary, but\nthe debt cancellation, budgetary support and other\nsubstantial injections of economic and humanitarian\nassistance extended to Ethiopia have not been linked to\na positive performance in the peace process. As far as\nEritrea is concerned, therefore, the problem is not\nEthiopia\u2019s bad-faith conduct in the border dispute, but\ninternational silence and acquiescence with regard to\nits violations, which has, in turn, encouraged its\nintransigence.\nIt is regrettable that the United Nations\nSecretariat and some Powers have introduced \u2014 and\ncontinue to dwell on \u2014 tangential issues, instead of\ntaking concrete action to push the peace process\nforward. Such notions are not only extraneous to the\nAlgiers Peace Agreement, but, if they were to become\noperational, would actually subvert and derail the\npeace process and significantly contribute to tension\nand conflict. Here, I am referring to the related issues\nof the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the\n\u201cdialogue\u201d to renegotiate the final and binding decision\nof the Boundary Commission.\nI would like to stress that the appointment of the\nSpecial Envoy occurred only a few weeks after\nEthiopia had formally and officially rejected the\nBoundary Commission decision requesting the Security\nCouncil to create a new mechanism. While my\nGovernment did not see any benefit or rationale for\nthat course of action, it did not reject the proposal\noutright. We sought unambiguous clarifications with\nregard to the mandate and functions of the Special\nEnvoy through various communications, emphasizing\nthat we could not possibly contemplate renegotiation of\nthe decision in any form. Unfortunately, our efforts did\nnot bear fruit, and the lack of clarity of the responses\nwe received only reinforced our original suspicions.\nMy Government has therefore informed the Secretary-\nGeneral that it considers that the issue of the Special\nEnvoy \u2014 which has eclipsed the key issue for almost a\nyear now \u2014 to be a closed chapter and appealed to the\nSecretary-General to refocus international attention on\nEthiopia\u2019s violations of the Algiers Peace Agreement\nand the rule of law.\nIn the same vein, the issue of bilateral dialogue\nwith Ethiopia should be viewed and can be understood\nonly in its proper perspective. Eritrea has no problem\nwith the idea of fully normalizing its relations with\nEthiopia and reviving good-neighbourly relations. We\nare neighbours, destined to live together and in\nharmony. But we cannot possibly put the cart before\nthe horse and discuss economic or security issues, or\nother issues relating to cooperation, while Ethiopia is\nforcibly occupying our land in blatant breach of the\nAlgiers Peace Agreement and the decision of the\nBoundary Commission. Indeed, Eritrea will not need\nthe good offices of an intermediary in order to resume\nnormal bilateral ties with Ethiopia once the critical\nborder issue is resolved legally and peacefully. I must\nstress that the border issue cannot be the subject of\nsterile dialogue such as that sought by Ethiopia. That is\nlegally untenable and practically impossible.\nThe cost of inaction by the international\ncommunity to regional peace and stability will be\nenormous, and my Government sincerely hopes that the\nindifference that we have witnessed over the past two\nyears will be rectified in time. Eritrea has shown\nmaximum patience and restraint, even though its\nsovereign territories remain occupied by force. But\npatience has a limit \u2014 particularly given that the\nhumanitarian burden is of great importance and that the\nsituation in that regard has been unsustainable for a\nlong time. Indeed, over 60,000 of our citizens continue\nto live in makeshift camps, unable to return to their\nhome villages.\nIn his address to the General Assembly on\n21 September 2004, the Secretary-General made a\npassionate appeal for respect for the rule of law at\nhome and abroad. The people and the Government of\nEritrea would like to thank him for that statement,\nwhich they subscribe to in its entirety and endorse\nwithout reservation. Eritreans continue to be victims of\nthe violation of the rule of law as a result of Ethiopia\u2019s\n13\n\nrejection, with impunity, of the final and binding\ndecision of an arbitration commission sanctioned by\nthe United Nations and other organizations, as well as\nby other States.\nEritreans also fully agree that the rule of law\nbegins at home, including at the United Nations. It\nmust not be forgotten that the implementation of the\nCommission\u2019s decision was guaranteed by a treaty\nobligation signed by the Secretary-General on behalf of\nthe United Nations. It is therefore essential to note that\nany stalemate in the demarcation process is a stalemate\nnot between Eritrea, which has accepted the decision\nwithout any reservations or conditions, and Ethiopia,\nwhich has rejected it, but between Ethiopia and the\nUnited Nations, which has guaranteed implementation\nand provided for punitive action, under Chapter VII of\nthe Charter, against the party that refuses to implement\nthe Commission\u2019s decision.\nThe United Nations has the duty of enforcing the\nrule of law. This is a violation of the rule of law and\ndemonstrates the collective failure of the United\nNations to uphold the law and to instil respect for it in\nour fellow men and women. Ethiopia cannot be above\nthe law; Eritrea should not be denied its protection, and\nthe United Nations must employ its enforcement\ncapacity for the rule of law by fulfilling its treaty\nobligations.\nBefore concluding, I would like to outline briefly\nthe views of my Government on other regional\nproblems. My Government warmly welcomes the\nprogress made over the past few months in promoting\nreconciliation and lasting peace in Somalia. Although\nwe are handicapped by the war imposed on us by\nEthiopia, we have nonetheless continued to make\nmodest contributions to a durable and peaceful\nresolution of Somalia\u2019s internal problem. Our approach\nhas always hinged on supporting the Somalis as they\ntry to find their own solutions and on preventing the\nfragmentation and Balkanization of Somalia, which\nhave been driven by external, rather than internal,\ntendencies.\nThe magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in the\nSudan is too well known to merit explanation here. But\nas the international community focuses on what is\ncurrently taking place in Darfur, what is often missed\nis the larger picture of regional destabilization and\nincalculable human suffering that the fundamentalist\nextremist regime has been fomenting for almost\n15 years. Furthermore, the ramifications of the\nNational Islamic Front\u2019s policies, which are based on\nextremist ideology, have not been confined to the\nSudan but have affected several neighbouring\ncountries, including my country. It is therefore\nessential that major Powers in the international\ncommunity see the problem for what it is and assess it\non the basis of what it portends.\nIn conclusion, I would like to restate the position\nof my Government on the relevant ongoing debate\nabout the reform of the United Nations system. It is\nclear to us, as a matter that has been reinforced by our\nrecent experience, that, despite many achievements,\nthere are areas of critical shortfall that require reform\nand restructuring. We also believe that parameters and\nconsiderations that were relevant when the United\nNations was established in the immediate aftermath of\nthe Second World War need to be revisited and\nadjusted, in accordance with contemporary realities.\nFurthermore, representation in the Security Council\nmust satisfy the criteria of reasonable regional\nrepresentation and equity, as well as of the equality of\nsovereign nations, as enshrined in the Charter."

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate\nyou, Sir, the Foreign Minister of Gabon, upon your\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\nand to wish you much success.\nThe United Nations was established out of the\ndevastation of the Second World War in order to build\na world of unity and of peace. Today, 60 years after the\nOrganization came into being, we must ask ourselves:\nWhat are we united for and what are we united against?\nAre we united for peace and security? Are we united\nfor fairness and justice? Are we united against terror?\nAre we united against tyranny?\nOr are we, sadly, united only in cynical and\nimmoral majority votes that make a mockery of the\nnoble ideals on which this body was founded?\nTomorrow is Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish\ncalendar, when all Jews stand before God to account\nfor their actions. It is an appropriate time for all\n19\n\nnations, separately and together, to engage in such an\naccounting.\nI sense a change in the world. In the face of the\nglobal campaign of terror which has left no country\nfree of its devastating impact, the world is beginning to\nrealize what we in Israel have long known: that\nterrorism is a challenge to humanity as a whole, not\njust to individual countries; that the response to that\nglobal threat must also be global if it is to be effective;\nthat the threat of terrorism anywhere is a threat to\nfreedom everywhere; that fighting terror is crucial to\nour ability to bring peace.\nThere was a time when the problems of terror,\nIslamic fundamentalism and Iranian nuclear ambition\nwere seen as local problems \u2014 Israel\u2019s problems \u2014\nnot challenges which threatened the community of\nnations as a whole. Today, however, our community of\nnations is more united than ever in the battle against\nterrorism, whose sole objective is to undermine\neverything that we seek to build: peace, stability,\nprosperity and opportunity for all.\nToday we are also more united than ever in\nopposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. The international community now realizes\nthat Iran \u2014 with missiles that can reach London, Paris,\nBerlin and southern Russia \u2014 poses a threat not only\nto the security of Israel, but to the security and stability\nof the whole world. Indeed, Iran has replaced Saddam\nHussein as the world\u2019s number-one exporter of terror,\nhate and instability.\nThe international community now also realizes,\nas reflected in Security Council resolution 1559\n(2004), that Syria\u2019s occupation of Lebanon and its\nsupport for Palestinian terror must end if our collective\naspirations are to be fulfilled.\nAnd the international community now realizes\nthat terror and tyranny are the twin enemies of the\nindividual freedoms and human rights \u2014 including the\nright to life itself \u2014 which define our humanity.\nToday, the community of nations knows that\nsecuring freedom and democracy for all the peoples of the\nworld must be our collective goal. The pictures of human\nflesh torn apart by the terrorists, from New York to\nBeslan \u2014 and just yesterday, once again, in Jerusalem\n\u2014 are waking us up to the challenge we face.\nIn that spirit of unity, and in the name of all those\nin the world who suffer from terror and tyranny, I call\non the Assembly to refocus its aspirations and its\npriorities. I call on the Assembly to end its obsession\nwith Israel and to ensure that United Nations resources\nare allocated more equally and more effectively. Our\nUnited Nations must provide solutions to the global\nchallenges of hunger and poverty, of disease and\nweapons proliferation, of drug trafficking and\nsustainable development. We must not let the\nPalestinian desire to vilify Israel distract our global\ncommunity from the obligation to address the needs of\nall peoples.\nI call on the Assembly to address head-on the\nactive involvement of Iran and Syria in terrorism and\nSyria\u2019s continued occupation of Lebanon. There can be\nno place in the community of nations for those who\npromote the killing of children. I call on the Assembly\nto promote practical measures to help nations cut off\nall financial and political lifelines of terror.\nI call on the Assembly to address the growth of\nanti-Semitism and other forms of racism and\nintolerance. I urge you, Mr. President, and the\nSecretary-General, to convene a special session of the\nAssembly on that crucial matter. We all share the\nresponsibility to educate our children to understanding\nand tolerance rather than to hatred and incitement.\nWe must build a united and global coalition to\nfight terrorism, racism and anti-Semitism. We must\nbuild a united front against the cold-blooded murderers\nof our children. In that battle, there is no middle\nground. There is no room for explanations or excuses.\nThere are no mitigating circumstances. Declarations\nand condemnations are very important, but they are not\nenough. Every nation, every Government, every leader\nhas the responsibility to act. Those who choose instead\nto support and sponsor terror must be isolated and held\nto account for their crimes.\nWhen I speak of terror and its dangers to life and\nfreedom, I speak from bitter personal experience. My\nown home town of Beersheva suffered a double suicide\nbombing just three weeks ago. Sixteen innocent people\nwere killed when their commuter buses were blown up.\nIn the middle of an important meeting with visiting\nofficials, I rushed to call my mother and brother to\ncheck that they were alive. Hamas, which operates\nfreely from Palestinian territory and receives support\nand safe haven from the regimes in Damascus and\nTehran, proudly claimed responsibility for that horrific\nattack.\n20\n\nAgain yesterday, as I was meeting with the\nSecretary-General to discuss peace in the Middle East,\nI was passed a note informing me of a suicide atrocity,\nin which two more Israelis were blown to pieces by a\nPalestinian terrorist. And this morning, once again, yet\nmore Palestinian murderers took the lives of three\nyoung Israelis in an attack on Morag.\nIn the last year alone, 150 Israelis have been\nkilled and thousands more injured in more than 40\nseparate suicide bombings and other cold-blooded\nattacks. More than 200 additional suicide-bombing\nattempts were blocked by our defensive measures.\nNo Israeli mother is free of the fear that her child\nmay be lost. No Israeli child is immune to the\nterrorists\u2019 plans. In the name of God above and all\nhumanity here on Earth, this killing must stop.\nPalestinian terrorism is the key reason that the\ndream of peace in the Middle East has not yet become\na reality. Combating this terror is crucial to the\nprospects for peace in our region. No peace initiative\ncan survive if terrorists continue to enjoy a free hand to\nundermine it.\nThe road map recognizes this, calling, in phase\none, for sustained Palestinian action against terror, the\ndismantling of terrorist organizations and the end of\nincitement in schools and the media. Sadly, the current\nPalestinian leadership has refused to fulfil those\nfundamental obligations, preferring to blame Israel for\nall its failures. The Palestinian side spends more energy\nfighting Israel here at the United Nations than it does\nfighting the terrorists in its own territory.\nIn the post-11-September world, this is not\nacceptable. The Palestinians are not exempt from the\nimperatives of the global war on terror. On the\ncontrary, it is in their clear interest to join it. To stand\nup against Hamas and Islamic Jihad is to stand up for\nPalestinian rights, not against them.\nWe urge the international community to recognize\nthis reality and help the voices of reform and\nmoderation within Palestinian society to emerge. The\nfuture of the Palestinian people will be determined by\nthe choices that the Palestinians and their leadership\nmake on the ground. The solutions \u2014 for the\nPalestinians and Israelis as one \u2014 lie in Gaza and\nRamallah, not in The Hague or New York.\nIsrael is acting in both the diplomatic and the\nsecurity arenas to deal with the consequences of this\nchronic failure of the Palestinian leadership. On the\ndiplomatic front, Israel accepted the road map in May\n2003, and we remain committed to its realization. At\nthis time, however, we have no responsible Palestinian\npartner ready to join us in this effort. Israel is now\nplanning to implement the disengagement plan as a\nmeans of enhancing security and establishing a new,\nmore promising platform for a return to negotiations.\nWe are in constant contact with the donor community\nand the World Bank in a joint effort to rebuild Gaza in\nthe wake of Israel\u2019s withdrawal.\nOn the security front, Israel is building a security\nfence to stop the unchecked wave of Palestinian\nattacks. After 20,000 terrorist attacks, we deserve to\nprotect our people. No other country would act\notherwise after 20, let alone 20,000, terrorist attacks.\nThe fence does not take lives. It saves them. Where\nthere is a fence, there is no terror. Where there is no\nfence, there is terror. The modified route of the fence\nreflects the necessary balance between the security of\nour citizens and the welfare of the Palestinian\npopulation, as called for by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court.\nMost important, the fence is reversible. The lives taken\nby terror are irreversible. By helping take terrorism out\nof the equation, the fence contributes to the prospect of\na return to negotiations and the realization of the road\nmap\u2019s vision of peace.\nI call on the Assembly to acknowledge this truth\nand to reject the continued Palestinian effort to have\ndelegations address Israel\u2019s response to terrorism,\ninstead of addressing the terrorism itself.\nUltimately, we need real contact and dialogue,\nbased on mutual respect for the humanity of the other\nif we are to resolve the conflict in the Middle East. The\nGovernment of Israel is ready for such contact. We are\nready to talk to any leadership \u2014 from Syria, Lebanon\nor the Palestinians \u2014 that comes to the table without\nterror and with the genuine intention of finding\nmutually acceptable solutions to our differences.\nTomorrow, Yom Kippur, is a day of prayer,\nfasting and soul-searching for the Jews. In Beersheva,\nin a synagogue named after my father, I will be praying\ntogether with those who have recently buried their\nmurdered children. I will pray that our collective\naspiration for life and freedom will prevail over the\nterrorists and those who sponsor them. I will pray that\nGod will deliver peace on earth, for all humanity. And\nI will pray that mankind can unite \u2014 through the\n21\n\nUnited Nations \u2014 to help make this dream become a\nreality.\nAnd I would like to say in Hebrew, Happy New\nYear."

        "file_text": "I bring to this\ngathering a warm greeting from the people of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu.\nMr. President, at the outset, I take this\nopportunity to congratulate you on your assumption of\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session. I also take this occasion to acknowledge\nwith deep gratitude the contributions of your\npredecessor, who so competently steered the work of\nthe fifty-eighth session to its conclusion.\nHere, I must also acknowledge the outstanding\nrole of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been\nresolute in his efforts to revitalize the Organization\u2019s\nability to address global concerns. My delegation\nreaffirms its support for Mr. Annan\u2019s profound and\nmeticulous leadership of the United Nations.\nI also take this opportunity to convey the\ncondolences of my Government and the people of\nVanuatu to the people of the Caribbean nations, in\nparticular Haiti, for the loss of so many lives and for\nthe extensive damage caused by the destructive forces\nof nature that recently swept through the region. We\noffer them our moral support and pray that the affected\npeoples will soon recover and that the devastated areas\nof their nations will be swiftly rehabilitated and rebuilt.\nThose inevitable natural calamities demonstrate once\nmore the extreme and particular vulnerability of island\nStates, which seriously affects national economies.\nEvery year, from this rostrum, we reaffirm our\nfaith and confidence in upholding the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter. We entered the new\nmillennium with much anticipation and hope of\ncreating a just and better world for all our citizens.\nHowever, global insecurity and the varying dimensions\nof serious conflict have created a frightening situation.\nIt is to be expected that the world will plunge into\nfurther turmoil unless the role of the United Nations \u2014\nthe only truly global body \u2014 is reinvigorated and\nrecovers its legitimate responsibility of addressing the\ncauses of conflict and maintaining peace and security. I\ncome to the Assembly with some trepidation, as I see\nour world spiralling out of control unless its Members\nuphold the universality of the United Nations decision-\nmaking process in addressing global concerns.\nThe world is at a crossroads and we meet here at\na critical juncture. Around us, civil strife, wars,\npoverty, disease, famine, drought, natural disasters,\nterrorism, environmental degradation, depletion of land\nand marine resources and other phenomena are\nravaging the world. The displacement of peoples from\ntheir natural habitats and the sacrilege of human\nsuffering in many parts of the world demonstrate that\n25\n\nunless immediate remedial strategies are implemented,\nthe global situation will continue to deteriorate.\nMoreover, the emergence of conflict in areas we\nonce believed stable, the deterioration of law and order\nand the senseless killing of innocent peoples are\npainful reminders that we need to rethink our policies\nand decisions. Globalization has brought with it both\nopportunities and challenges, but for the small island\nStates the challenges are much more ominous. Those\nare the realities.\nThose negative developments lead me to\nconclude that the United Nations is indispensable and\nthat we all need to work as friends and equal partners.\nGlobalization has brought nations together. We are\ninterlinked and interdependent. That demands global\ncooperation and governance from all responsible\nMembers of the Organization. Understandably, there\nare the vested interests of the powerful, but that only\nnecessitates genuine cooperation and goodwill to\nachieve convergence of those interests. The United\nNations role in that regard must remain fundamental in\norder to ensure compatibility with the international\nlegal framework. Maverick policies and decisions will\nonly create further divisions and hostility.\nWith that in mind, I believe there is now\nconsensus on introducing far-reaching reforms that\nmake the United Nations relevant for all its Members,\nwith the fundamental objective of preserving\ninternational peace, security and stability.\nMy Government fully supports efforts to reform\nthe United Nations system in order to ensure a stronger\nand more effective Organization. On that note, my\ndelegation endorses the view of other delegations on\nthe need to review the membership of the Security\nCouncil so that it will better reflect geographical\ndistribution and the underrepresented groups of\nMember countries of the United Nations, without\naffecting the authority of the Council.\nI hope all the rhetoric that has come before the\nAssembly can be translated into concrete and practical\naction. We must be resolute in our collective desire to\nwork together as sovereign nations in addressing the\nworld\u2019s problems through multilateral institutions. The\nblueprint for international cooperation has been\nestablished, but reforming certain structures in the\nUnited Nations system must be seen as a prerequisite if\nwe are serious about moving forward. The Achilles\nheel of the current structure is the imbalance of power\nin the United Nations system. It has become so chronic\nthat it has weakened the multilateral focus,\ncohesiveness and internationalism of the United\nNations.\nThe principles of democratization and good\ngovernance so actively advocated and championed by\nsome Members must be reflected in the reorganization\nand decision-making process of the United Nations\nsystem.\nIt is in this regard that Vanuatu supports the\nreview of the permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil in order to include Japan and one\nrepresentative each from the African continent, the\nMiddle East and the group of small developing\ncountries. A more representative Council will bring\nabout openness and transparency, create confidence\nand ameliorate understanding and cooperation. A\nrestructuring of the membership of the Security\nCouncil is long overdue. Diversity is essential there.\nMy Government looks forward to the report of\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Threats.\nAlthough the fight against terrorism takes centre\nstage, it must not overshadow the socio-economic\ndevelopment agenda and other serious security\nconcerns affecting the developing world, and in\nparticular small island States. Resources will inevitably\nbe diverted towards combating terrorism in all its\nfacets, but judicious decisions need to be taken. It is\nagainst that background that our delegation wishes to\nassociate itself with statements made by other\ndelegations on the imperativeness of supporting the\ndevelopment constraints of developing nations, and in\nparticular the concerns of the small island States on\nvulnerability.\nAt the Millennium Summit leaders adopted the\neight Millennium Development Goals, with targets to\nbe achieved by 2015. Although commitments have\nbeen made, the lethargic performance of many\ncountries, including Vanuatu, demonstrate the need for\nmore international support in assisting countries to\nmeet those targets.\nThe global economic situation today\ndiscriminates against many developing economies.\nUnfair trading practices and the imposition of intrusive\npolicies on national economies \u2014 including that of\nVanuatu \u2014 affect those economies by opening them up\nto unfavourable conditions that only favour stronger\nnations. The post-Canc\u00fan period poses extreme\nchallenges to the economic survival and socio-\n26\n\neconomic stability of many small developing nations\nlike Vanuatu.\nMy Government\u2019s initial focus is on the social\nsector, namely, on health and education. The\nGovernment\u2019s prioritized action agenda, which was\nlaunched last year in consultation with our\ndevelopment partners, is the catalyst for Vanuatu\u2019s\nmedium- to long-term strategic planning. This\ndevelopment policy framework is consistent with\nachieving the targets of the Millennium Development\nGoals and emphasizes the need to empower our rural\npopulation through infrastructure- and capacity-\nbuilding initiatives. We appeal to our development\npartners to adequately assist us in its implementation.\nOn that note, my delegation wishes to express its\ngratitude to the United States of America for granting\nVanuatu eligibility to access development funding from\nthe Millennium Challenge Account.\nThe primary responsibility for development lies\nwith a State itself. Yet, external influences and\nconditional aid have not adequately corresponded with\nVanuatu\u2019s development priorities and achievements.\nThe pretext for meting out foreign advice conditioned\nwith development assistance has been to improve\ngovernance and other sectors considered vital in\nestablishing a strong economy. In Vanuatu\u2019s case that\nline of argument has not produced tangible results,\nwith restricted progress being reflected in our\ncontinuous struggle with reforms that are more or less\ndictated by external forces.\nBoth the recipient and the external assistance\nmust be balanced and sensitive to national interests.\nToo often, that normal reaction is misunderstood by\nsome of our development partners. From Vanuatu\u2019s\nperspective, externally driven reforms must be\nbuttressed by an equal partnership that respects local\ntradition, culture and the rights of all citizens without\ndisturbing the essential uniting mechanisms of society\nthat have successfully held us together over time. An\nexploitative agenda can only erode and dismantle those\ningrained mechanisms, leaving us vulnerable to the\nrapid changes affecting all of us today. Vanuatu\nembraces democracy and the concepts of governance\nand transparency, but they must be tailored to suit the\ntraditional system without affecting the relevance and\nsignificance of those far-reaching principles.\nIn recent times, the history of the Organization\nhas been characterized by indecision, which blemishes\nthe record of the United Nations. I speak about the\nlongstanding issue of self-determination, and in\nparticular the case of West Papua, and I do so while\nbeing cognizant of the Charter and while espousing the\nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization\u2019s\nefforts in the process of self-determination. The United\nNations must be consistent in its decisions for the\nrecognition and respect of the fundamental rights to\nself-determination for the people of West Papua. The\ntruth surrounding the so-called Act of Free Choice\nmust be exposed to the Melanesian sisters and brothers\nof West Papua and the rest of the international\ncommunity. Saddest of all is General Assembly\nresolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969, concerning West\nPapua. How can the United Nations continue to ignore\nthe cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?\nAs world leaders, we have time and again expressed\nserious concerns and dissatisfaction about the fact that\ncertain decisions and actions by the United Nations or\nits bodies were not consistent with the purposes and\nintentions of the Charter. However, in the case of West\nPapua, absolutely nothing has been done to rectify the\ngross violation of internationally accepted practice. It\nis therefore our joint responsibility to address this grey\narea of history.\nThe continuing disputes and concerns raised with\nregard to the legality of United Nations-endorsed\ninstruments that have been concluded throughout the\nyears \u2014 such as the New York Agreement of 1962, to\ngovern the United Nations administration of the so-\ncalled Act of Free Choice in West Papua \u2014 is a clear\nexample challenging the integrity and validity of\nUnited Nations resolutions at that time. In our opinion,\nthe United Nations-conducted exercises were a total\nfarce conditioned only to suit the geopolitical climate\nof that period. The United Nations cannot, and must\nnot, continue to turn a blind eye to its own past\nfailures. It is morally, politically and legally wrong to\ndo so. The Netherlands in particular, which was the\nformer colonial authority, should also recognize that it\nshould shoulder some responsibility in helping to\nresolve the unfortunate situation of West Papua in a\npeaceful and transparent manner. Why is no one\naccountable for those unjust decisions affecting the\nlives of millions of people today?\nVanuatu therefore calls for the establishment of a\nspecial commission of inquiry to review the United\nNations conduct in relation to the 1969 Act. We also\ncall for the United Nations to send a fact-finding\nmission to examine the situation in West Papua with\nregard to human rights abuses and other related issues.\nAnd we call for the reinscription of West Papua on the\n27\n\nlist of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those are\ncritically challenging responsibilities.\nOn a final matter, my delegation strongly\nreaffirms its support for resolution 2758 (XXVI),\nwhich was adopted during the twenty-sixth session, in\n1971, and which recognized the legal and political\nrepresentation of the People\u2019s Republic of China as a\nMember of the United Nations. Vanuatu again\nreiterates its unwavering support for one China and\nurges all members of the United Nations to work in the\ninterests of world peace and stability in the Asia-\nPacific region.\nIn conclusion, I must bring to the attention of the\nAssembly another priority issue that is of grave\nimportance to my Government and nation. I would\nonce again like to raise the matter of the relocation of\nthe Pacific Operations Centre of the Economic and\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\nfrom Vanuatu to another location. My Government was\nnot properly consulted in that regard, and requests that\nthe decision to relocate the Centre from Vanuatu be\nreconsidered. If the Centre\u2019s relevance in the region is\nbeing questioned, then my Government would propose\nthat a proper review be carried out with a view to\nrestructuring the ESCAP office in order to relocate the\nPacific Operations Centre to Bangkok. Programmes\nand activities under ESCAP responsibility may be\nbetter coordinated through the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme activities in the region.\nI hope that wisdom will prevail as the debate\ncontinues on our future destiny. Despite all our\ndifferences and diversity, human security for all is our\nmain goal. That should remain the focus of the United\nNations agenda. The cardinal question is whether\nMembers will allow the United Nations to undertake\nserious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead. The\nfuture remains in our hands."

        "file_text": "I am pleased\nto welcome and congratulate you, Sir, and the Republic\nof Gabon through you, for allowing us to share your\nexperience and expertise on the occasion of the fifty-\nninth session of the General Assembly. I must convey\nto Mr. Julian Hunte, Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia,\nmy country\u2019s gratitude for his hard work and\nmemorable contribution to this Organization over the\npast year.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\nreaffirms its strong support for and commitment to the\npraiseworthy, attainable Millennium Development\nGoals. Their stated objectives are fundamental and\nhave long been incorporated into my country\u2019s national\nhuman development agenda.\nFor decades, before the Millennium Development\nGoals were agreed upon, Saint Kitts and Nevis had\ninstituted compulsory primary and secondary\neducation, which may explain our achievement of a\nliteracy rate of 97.8 per cent. We in the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) are very proud of our\nachievements in the field of education. We owe much\nof that success to our coherent system of education and\nalso to the University of the West Indies, whose\nacademic credentials continue to amaze and evolve to\nmeet the needs of our people. We invite fellow United\nNations Member States to explore that resource in the\nCaribbean so their citizens can pursue higher education\nin that great institution of learning and in the most\npeaceful and pristine of multicultural settings.\nIt is easy to become excited when I speak of our\nefforts in addressing the issue of women in\ndevelopment, but we will not let down our guard. In\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, we have recognized and\nbenefited from gender equality and the empowerment\nof women. It may be recalled that Saint Kitts and Nevis\nwas among the first in this hemisphere to create a\nMinistry Of Women\u2019s Affairs.\nEqually important to the Government of Saint\nKitts and Nevis is winning the war against poverty. We\nremain steadfast in our efforts to eliminate poverty,\nwhich is not simply a noble ideal. It is a practical,\nachievable objective and, by God, it is the right thing\nto do. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, in the last seven years,\nwe have endured social and economic dislocations in\nthe wake of several catastrophic natural disasters, 9/11\nand the downturns in the global economy. Nonetheless,\nwith due care and attention to prudent fiscal and\nmonetary management, we are investing in the socio-\neconomic development of our country and continue to\nplace people first in all that we do.\nMy Government has invested greatly in our\nnational health system, supported by the construction\nof a modern hospital and the professional development\nof health care workers. We believe that this will\nimprove the quality of and access to health care for\nnationals and visitors alike. Our continued efforts to\nbuild a healthy nation are consistent with our resolve to\nreduce child mortality and improve maternal health.\nOur capital project investments have improved\nthe existing distribution networks to satisfy demand\nand to better extend service coverage for potable water\nthroughout the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Our\nroad improvement and maintenance programmes have\nresurfaced miles of road and improved drainage\nthroughout the twin island Federation. The\nimprovement of the tourism product has generated\nseveral new jobs consistent with my Government\u2019s\npeople-focused agenda. It has allowed us to depend\n14\n\nless on an agriculture-based economy, which continues\nto suffer from Government subsidies offered to farmers\nin large countries. Such subsidies make it more\ndifficult for small economies like mine to compete.\nOur capacity to compete is further undermined by the\nrecent unilateral decision of the European Union to\nreduce the price of sugar by more than 30 per cent.\nDespite these challenges, we continue to press on,\nmindful of the need to preserve the environment. Saint\nKitts and Nevis are two beautiful islands faced with the\ngeographic reality of being located in the hurricane\ncorridor. We witness the cost of beach and coastal\nerosion resulting from rising sea levels and hurricanes.\nIntegrating environmentally sustainable policies into\nour development agenda has been a real challenge.\nHowever, our determination to protect and preserve the\nislands\u2019 patrimony by adopting environmentally\nfriendly programmes is imperative.\nAt this juncture, I need to emphasize the current\nsituation facing small island developing States. All\nsmall island developing States lack the economy of\nscale to overcome their vulnerabilities on their own.\nWe are extremely vulnerable unless we form\ngeographical partnerships, as CARICOM has done.\nThat, however, does not exempt us from the\nvulnerabilities that we face every day. Geographical\npartnership does allow for a quick response in the\nevent of adversity.\nMy delegation urges the international community\nto accept the concept of vulnerability, leading to a\nvulnerability index that can be appropriately applied to\nsmall island developing States. Grenada\u2019s devastation\nwithin three hours of being struck by hurricane Ivan\ndramatizes for us how a generation of development\nprogress can be wiped out in a small vulnerable nation.\nThere is a pressing need for a global development fund\nto assist small island developing States in recovery\nfollowing national disasters.\nPragmatic and productive partnerships are the\nmost effective vehicle available to the international\ncommunity to tackle the multitude of problems we\nface. We speak of important issues, such as democracy,\nglobalization, terrorism, poverty eradication, human\ndevelopment and the spread of infectious disease, as if\nthey were completely disconnected. The goal of human\ndevelopment on any scale is best achieved by\nrecognizing the interconnectedness of our lives, our\neconomies and our policies. That imposes an obligation\nto develop common strategies, partnerships and policy\napproaches that accept and address the intrinsic\nlinkages among the problems facing nation States.\nI submit that the Pan-Caribbean Partnership\nAgainst HIV/AIDS is the first and only regional\nmechanism created to deal with the pandemic in a\nmultinational way. Our regional cooperation has led to\nreductions in the cost of antiretroviral drugs from\n$20,000 per person per year to $200 per patient per\nyear. We have also been successful in negotiating\nreduced prices for other important pharmaceutical\ndrugs. That experience speaks to the value of\npartnership and cooperation. We believe that networks\nare the most effective means of problem solving. We\npraise the efforts of the Global Fund and the United\nNations for their work in mobilizing additional\nresources to treat people living with HIV/AIDS and to\nfight the spread of the disease.\nThe idea of fighting HIV/AIDS only through\nfaith simplifies the human condition and suggests a\nmisunderstanding of the nature and scope of the\ndisease. My Government insists that a pragmatic policy\napproach to fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS is as\nfundamental to good governance as is the holding of\nfree and fair elections. Good governance means\nGovernments listening to and caring for their citizens.\nGood governance implies that leaders must lead with\nmoral courage and take bold and sometimes\ncontroversial steps in the public interests.\nGood governance means placing the United\nNations at the centre of our international interaction, in\naccordance with and in full respect for the Charter.\nGood governance requires respect for every country\u2019s\nright to choose its own course, consistent with its own\nlaws and the will of its people. Good governance is not\nsimply about whether we ostracize a country if its\npolicies run counter to our national agenda. It should\nbe about creating better understanding, cooperation and\npartnership and building bridges of friendship. Good\ngovernance suggests to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis that\nGovernments abide by and commit themselves to\ninternationally recognized standards and principles and\ndo not discard them when it becomes expedient. Good\ngovernance entails holding everyone to the same\nstandard and not raising the bar for some countries and\nlowering it for others.\nGood governance should propel us to recognize\nthe fact that nearly 23 million people in the Republic of\n15\n\nChina on Taiwan are essentially in a diplomatic black\nhole, alienated from our international discourse. Good\ngovernance requires all peace-loving nations to urge\nboth sides of the Taiwan Straits not only to commit to,\nbut also to engage in constructive dialogue and\npreventive diplomacy. Good governance behooves us\nto support the hard work of the leaders and people of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan to comply with and\nwork within the framework of international law. Good\ngovernance says to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis that a\npeople committed to the rule of law and democracy and\nwilling to invest in human development at home and\nabroad should never be excluded from the fraternity of\nnations.\nIn addition, CARICOM takes great pride in our\nparliamentary system of Government and our solid\ndemocracies from a centuries-old tradition. Our history\nteaches us that good governance and human\ndevelopment are indivisible. Where representative\ndemocracy, democratic institution-building, freedom of\nexpression and the protection of human rights have not\nflourished, human development has suffered. Where\nGovernments have failed to respect the will of the\npeople, human development has faltered. Although\nCARICOM faces great limitations and challenges\nowing to the absence of natural and financial resources,\nwe have managed to build credible democratic\ninstitutions, a reliable judicial system and lasting\ndemocracies in which the transition from incumbent\nGovernments to opposition parties passes without\nincident. We are ready to share these experiences with\nthe rest of the world.\nIn conclusion, for decades countries and\nacademics have questioned the viability of small\nStates. History, though, has witnessed not only our\nviability, but also that we are a dependable beacon of\nhope for others, be they large or small. We live in an\ninterconnected world where national political decisions\nin one corner of the world have devastating\nconsequences thousands of miles away.\nWe must therefore of necessity become our\nbrothers\u2019 keepers. In that vein, we call on Member\nStates to lend their support to the international meeting\nto review the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, scheduled to be held in Mauritius in January\n2005.\nFinally, I would like to repeat my call that\npartnership must trump nationalism and that\nmultilateralism must transcend unilateralism."

        "file_text": "It gives me\ngreat pleasure to address the General Assembly on\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, currently chaired\nby my country, Qatar. I would like to seize this\nopportunity to extend congratulations to Mr. Jean Ping\non his assumption of the presidency of the current\nsession of the General Assembly, wishing His\nExcellency every success in the discharge of his\nfunctions. I would also like to extend thanks to his\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for guiding the work of\nthe previous session.\nIt also gives me pleasure to express my\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for his\njudicious conduct of the work of this Organization\nduring a critical period in which international relations\nhave faced and are still facing immense challenges.\nThe United Nations was established six decades\nago as an expression of the aspirations of all the\nmembers of the international community to save the\nworld from the scourge of war, to maintain\ninternational peace and security, and to achieve\ncooperation among nations and people in various\nfields. Roughly two decades after its inception, on\n15 June 1964, to be exact, the Group of 77 was\nestablished to express the aspirations of scores of\ndeveloping countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America\nto work with each other under the umbrella of the\nUnited Nations, with a view to promoting their\ncommon economic interests, developing their\nnegotiating capacity regarding various international\neconomic issues and increasing the bonds of their\ntechnical cooperation.\nJust as the United Nations has grown, its\nmembership has increased and the scope of its activity\nhas expanded, so, too, the Group of 77 and China has\nattracted new members into its membership \u2014 which\nnow stands at 132 States, constituting more than two\nthirds of the membership of the United Nations.\nOur Group embodies the commitment of the\ndeveloping countries to the mission of the United\nNations and their determination to be guided by the\nlofty principles enshrined in its Charter. While the\nministerial meetings of the Group highlight with\nutmost certainty its close relationship with the\ninternational organizations, the actions of its States\nsince April 2000, when it convened its first meeting at\nthe level of presidents and heads of Government,\nreaffirm the interest of its members in promoting\ncoordination among themselves, inspired by the\nprinciples of the United Nations to achieve their aims.\nIn the view of the Group of 77 and China, the\ndifficult challenge facing the international community\ntoday is that of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity while achieving economic welfare and\ndevelopment. The history of international relations\nover the second half of the last century has shown that\nit is almost impossible to maintain peace and security\nas long as people lack the minimum requirements for a\nbasic dignified livelihood. Poverty and destitution have\noften resulted in tensions that have led to breaches of\ninternational peace and security, and it is no\ncoincidence that the poorest regions in the world are\nthe ones that have suffered the most complicated\nregional conflicts.\nTo achieve the aims of security and development\nsimultaneously, the international community needs to\nadopt more equitable policies that do justice to a large\nsegment of the members of the international\ncommunity who still lack many of the basic necessities\nof life.\nIt is indisputable that globalization has acquired\nan immense momentum and yielded positive results.\nNevertheless, it has been accompanied by some\nadverse effects as well, and a review and\nreconsideration of a number of current international\neconomic policies is needed before globalization can\nacquire the human face it is supposed to have.\nThe continued imbalance in the distribution of the\nbenefits of international economic interdependence, the\nprogressive widening of the gap between the developed\nand the developing countries, and the deterioration of\nthe economic conditions in quite a few countries of the\nSouth, with the attendant adverse effects on the\nenvironment, will accentuate feelings of discontent and\nfrustration and could even lead to abhorrent forms of\ninternational conflict.\nAccordingly, it is necessary to eliminate the\nobstacles that make it difficult for developing countries\nto reap the fruits of world economic growth, and the\ninternational community must reaffirm its commitment\nto the eradication of poverty and the achievement of\nthe Millennium Development Goals through a deeper\nand more comprehensive integration of the developing\ncountries in the world economy.\n13\n\nThe Group of 77 and China urgently calls for the\nestablishment of an open multilateral trading system,\none which takes into account the norms of justice and\nthe rule of law and is geared to assisting developing\ncountries combat poverty and underdevelopment. Such\na system requires the elimination of bias in the\nliberalization of trade between the developed and the\ndeveloping countries and the discontinuation of\npractices that continue to impede freedom of\ncommerce, such as recourse to agricultural subsidies,\nsupport for certain products and restrictions on the\nmovement of individuals, which make it impossible for\ndeveloping countries to tap their potential or market\nmany of their products.\nIn this regard we call on the developed countries\nto liberalize trade at a faster rate by removing the\nvarious obstacles that have so far deprived the\ndeveloping countries of their right to enjoy\ninternational trade relations based on equal\nopportunity. While noting the progress achieved in the\nDoha negotiations on the question of agriculture, we\nsupport the access to the world market of other\nproducts from developing countries and urge that this\nissue should be accorded the priority it deserves.\nMoreover, there should be agreement on specific\nmeasures to ensure sufficient financial flows to\ndeveloping countries, especially foreign direct\ninvestment, to assist those countries in building the\nproduction capacity they need to compete in the world\nmarket. We would also stress the importance of\nenabling everyone to benefit from the achievements of\nscience and technology and thereby to gain access to\nsources of knowledge and receive help in achieving\ndevelopment.\nA review of the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration indicates that its objectives\nrelating to the countries of Africa and the least\ndeveloped countries have so far seemed unattainable.\nThis is due in large measure to the failure of countries\nto fulfil the commitments they so generously made at\nvarious United Nations conferences and summits. As\nthe General Assembly is going to undertake the first\nreview of the Millennium Declaration next year, we\nshould seize the opportunity of our meeting today to\nrenew our commitment to the prompt implementation\nof the Declaration. At the 2005 review of the\nDeclaration, the Group of 77 and China will present a\nseries of implementing proposals, most of which focus\non the development of multilateral international\nrelations, with particular emphasis on the situation in\nAfrica, the least developed countries and the\nlandlocked developing countries. We have participated\nactively in seeking practical solutions to the problems\nbesetting those regions and will participate in the\nforthcoming review of the Barbados Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States early in 2005. I take this\nopportunity to urge the international community to\nsupport the Barbados Programme of Action, as it is an\nintegral part of our efforts to move towards a better\nworld.\nAllow me now to address, on behalf of my\ncountry, Qatar, a number of political issues closely\nrelated to our aim of enabling the developing countries\nand peoples to enjoy their full economic rights. In\nparticular, I wish to single out the absence of\ndemocracy and the prolonged slackening of political\nreform evident in a number of countries of the South,\nand probably most apparent in the past few years in the\nMiddle East, where they have been at the root of most\nof the harsh social and economic suffering currently\nplaguing that region.\nPolitical reform and people\u2019s participation in\ndecision-making are no longer an option but have\nbecome a definite necessity. As the history of\neconomic relations has shown, the States that have\nmade the greatest economic achievements \u2014 whether\nin the North or in the South \u2014 have been those which\nwere most committed to the exercise of democracy.\nThe few exceptions \u2014 States that have managed to\nimprove their economic performance without following\nthe principles of democracy \u2014 have known limited\nsuccess and have continued to be vulnerable to sudden\neconomic upheavals.\nJust as international economic relations are\ndominated by the discourse on sustainable\ndevelopment, another discourse must be launched on\nwhat I would term \u201csustainable reform\u201d. There is no\nlesson to be learned from the experience of the\ncountries of the South which undertake political reform\none moment then regress the next or take one step\ntowards democracy to serve a selfish interest then take\ntwo steps backwards once that interest has been\nsatisfied. One must instead look for guidance to the\nlong history of development, which shows that those\nStates which succeed are those which realize that their\neconomies must be based on efficiency and that\nefficiency can be achieved, not by fiat and policies of\n14\n\nintimidation and confinement, but only by discussion\nof and participation in public affairs.\nThe question of Palestine embodies the suffering\nof a people deprived of both its political and its\neconomic rights and struggling, despite its difficulties,\nto remedy the situation. However, the Israeli\noccupation remains a crushing burden on the legitimate\nPalestinian dreams of freedom and development. For\nmore than 50 years, the question of Palestine has been\non the agenda of the General Assembly. Hence, the\ninternational community needs to listen to its\nconscience and to reconsider its position, bearing in\nmind that this question despite its humanitarian nature\nand manifest legitimacy, has been allowed to fester\nfrom one century to the next, thus compounding the\ntragedy of the Palestinian people before the might of\nthe Israeli occupation forces. Compelling Israel to\nimplement the resolutions of international legitimacy is\nmore than a mere duty, because such legitimacy must\nnot be applied selectively. Also, Israel must fulfil the\ncommitments it has made, in accordance with the\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice\nissued on 9 July 2004 and later endorsed by the\nGeneral Assembly at its tenth emergency special\nsession. This includes its commitment to the road map;\nhalting the construction of the separation wall, which\nhas harmed the Palestinian homeland and disrupted\nlivelihoods; and enabling the Palestinian people to\nexercise its right to self determination and to establish\nan independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its\ncapital, that would coexist in security and peace with\nIsrael.\nRelated to this is the need to achieve a\ncomprehensive peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli\nconflict on the basis of Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all the\nterritories occupied in 1967, including the Syrian\nGolan and the Lebanese Shaba\u2019a farms. In this regard,\nwe stress the need to transform the Middle East into a\nzone free of weapons of mass destruction, without any\nexception.\nAs regards Iraq, it is our hope that Security\nCouncil resolution 1546 (2004) will help stabilize the\nsituation so as to allow the implementation of the\nresolution\u2019s timetable regarding the holding of free,\ndemocratic elections and the timely drafting of a\npermanent constitution as a prelude to the\nestablishment of an elected constitutional government.\nAlso, we will spare no effort in supporting the\nreconstruction of Iraq, and we affirm our position of\nprinciple regarding the need to safeguard its\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in its internal affairs. We would also\nlike to emphasize the central role of the United Nations\nin Iraq.\nWe note with satisfaction the commitment of the\nSudan to work closely with the international\ncommunity to resolve the conflict in the Darfur region.\nThis makes it incumbent on the international\ncommunity to cooperate positively with the Sudanese\nGovernment, especially since it has initiated actions to\nrestore the rule of law to mitigate the suffering of the\ninhabitants of that region. We also welcome the\naccords that were signed to find a peaceful settlement\nto the problem of southern Sudan and urge the\ninternational community to support the efforts of the\nGovernment of the Sudan in this regard.\nThese last issues which I have raised, although\nseemingly of a political nature related to chronic\nregional problems, mainly in the Middle East, are not,\nin fact, far removed from the endeavours of the Group\nof 77 and China to achieve a more equitable\ninternational order. The regional stability that is sought\nin each of these cases will allow economic\nreconstruction on a sound basis in every instance.\nThe Group of 77 has been striving for more than\n40 years on more than one front. While building\nbridges among developing counties, it has actively\nsought to reach out to the developed countries and\nconvince them that the interest of the international\neconomic order lies in narrowing the gap, rather than\nwidening it. Moreover, it will always remain\ncommitted to the principles of the United Nations,\nmindful of the need for continuous coordination with\nits organs and bodies."

        "file_text": "Thank you for the honour of\naddressing the General Assembly. The American\npeople respect the idealism that gave life to this\nOrganization. And we respect the men and women of\nthe United Nations, who stand for peace and human\nrights in every part of the world. Welcome to New\nYork City, and welcome to the United States of\nAmerica.\nDuring the past three years, I have addressed the\nGeneral Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country,\nand in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at\na time of tremendous opportunity for the United\nNations and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the\ncircle of liberty, security and development has been\nexpanding in our world. This progress has brought\nunity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and\nAsia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic\n8\n\nchance to widen the circle even further, to fight\nradicalism and terror with justice and dignity and to\nachieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.\nThe United Nations and my country share the\ndeepest commitments. Both the American Declaration\nof Independence and the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of\nevery human life. That dignity is honoured by the rule\nof law, limits on the power of the State, respect for\nwomen, protection of private property, free speech,\nequal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity is\ndishonoured by oppression, corruption, tyranny,\nbigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent.\nBoth our founding documents affirm that this bright\nline between justice and injustice \u2014 between right and\nwrong \u2014 is the same in every age, every culture and\nevery nation.\nWise Governments also stand for these principles\nfor very practical and realistic reasons. We know that\ndictators are quick to choose aggression, while free\nnations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know\nthat oppressive Governments support terror, while free\nGovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We\nknow that free peoples embrace progress and life,\ninstead of becoming the recruits for murderous\nideologies.\nEvery nation that wants peace will share the\nbenefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks\npeace has an obligation to help build that world.\nEventually there is no safe isolation from terror\nnetworks, or failed States that shelter them, or outlaw\nregimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually\nthere is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet\nlife by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.\nIn this young century our world needs a new\ndefinition of security. Our security is not merely found\nin spheres of influence or some balance of power. The\nsecurity of our world is found in the advancing rights\nof mankind.\nThose rights are advancing across the world. And\nacross the world, the enemies of human rights are\nresponding with violence. Terrorists and their allies\nbelieve the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nthe United States Bill of Rights and every charter of\nliberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyed\nand forgotten. They believe that dictators should\ncontrol every mind and tongue in the Middle East and\nbeyond. They believe that suicide and torture and\nmurder are fully justified to serve any goal they\ndeclare. And they act on their beliefs.\nIn the last year alone terrorists have attacked\npolice stations and banks and commuter trains and\nsynagogues and a school filled with children. This\nmonth in Beslan we saw once again how the terrorists\nmeasure their success in the death of the innocent and\nin the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was\nheld hostage along with her son and her nephew. Her\nnephew did not survive. She recently visited the\ncemetery and saw what she called the \u201clittle graves\u201d.\nShe said, \u201cI understand that there is evil in the world,\nbut what have these little creatures done?\u201d\nThe Russian children did nothing to deserve such\nawful suffering and fright and death. The people of\nMadrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have\ndone nothing to deserve sudden and random murder.\nThose acts violate the standards of justice in all\ncultures and the principles of all religions. All civilized\nnations are in this struggle together and all must fight\nthe murderers.\nWe are determined to destroy terror networks\nwherever they operate, and the United States is grateful\nto every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets,\ntrack down their operatives and disrupt their plans. We\nare determined to end the State sponsorship of terror,\nand my nation is grateful to all that participated in the\nliberation of Afghanistan. We are determined to\nprevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of the\nworld, and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many\nnations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people\nfrom an outlaw dictator.\nThe dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a\nceasefire, to fully comply with all Security Council\nresolutions, then ignored more than a decade of those\nresolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised\nserious consequences for his defiance. The\ncommitments we make must have meaning. When we\nsay \u201cserious consequences\u201d, for the sake of peace there\nmust be serious consequences. So a coalition of nations\nenforced the just demands of the world.\nDefending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough.\nOur broader mission as United Nations Members is to\napply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Our\nwider goal is to promote hope and progress as the\nalternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose\nis to build a better world beyond the war on terror.\n9\n\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have established a\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nIn three years the contributing countries have funded\nprojects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total\nof $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertaken\na $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment\nand humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing\na special focus on 15 countries where the need is most\nurgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time,\nand our unprecedented commitment will bring new\nhope to those who have walked too long in the shadow\nof death.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have joined together to\nconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We\nare supporting organizations that rescue the victims,\npassing stronger anti-trafficking laws and warning\ntravellers that they will be held to account for\nsupporting this modern form of slavery. Women and\nchildren should never be exploited for pleasure or\ngreed, anywhere on Earth.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, we should\ntake seriously the protection of life from exploitation\nunder any pretext. In this session, the General\nAssembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored by\nCosta Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human\ncloning. I support that draft resolution and urge all\nGovernments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no\nhuman life should ever be produced or destroyed for\nthe benefit of another.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have changed the way\nwe fight poverty, curb corruption and provide aid. In\n2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold\napproach that links new aid from developed nations to\nreal reform in developing ones. And through the\nMillennium Challenge Account, my nation is\nincreasing our aid to developing nations that expand\neconomic freedom and invest in the education and\nhealth of their own people.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have acted to lift the\ncrushing burden of debt that limits the growth of\ndeveloping economies and holds millions of people in\npoverty. Since those efforts began in 1996, poor\ncountries with the heaviest debt burdens have received\nmore than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the\nbuild-up of future debt, my country and other nations\nhave agreed that international financial institutions\nshould increasingly provide new aid in the form of\ngrants rather than loans.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the world\nmust have more effective means to stabilize regions in\nturmoil and to halt religious violence and ethnic\ncleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to\nrespond to future crises.\nThe United States and Italy have proposed a\nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight\n(G-8) countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers \u2014\ninitially from Africa \u2014 so they can conduct operations\non that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the\nG-8 will help that peacekeeping force with deployment\nand logistical needs.\nAt this hour, the world is witnessing terrible\nsuffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of\nthe Sudan, crimes my Government has concluded are\ngenocide. The United States played a key role in efforts\nto broker a ceasefire, and we are providing\nhumanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people.\nRwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudan\nto help improve security so that aid can be delivered.\nThe Security Council adopted a new resolution that\nsupports an expanded African Union force to help\nprevent further bloodshed and that urges the\nGovernment of the Sudan to stop flights by military\naircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the\nCouncil on this timely and necessary action. I call on\nthe Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire it\nsigned, and to stop the killing in Darfur.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, peaceful\nnations must stand for the advance of democracy. No\nother system of government has done more to protect\nminorities, to secure the rights of labour, to raise the\nstatus of women or to channel human energy to the\npursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise of\ndemocratic Governments in predominantly Hindu and\nMuslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures.\nDemocratic institutions have taken root in modern\nsocieties and in traditional societies. When it comes to\nthe desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of\ncivilizations. People everywhere are capable of\nfreedom and worthy of freedom.\nFinding the full promise of representative\nGovernment takes time, as America has found in two\ncenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one\n10\n\nform of representative Government, because\ndemocracies by definition take on the unique character\nof the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know\nwith certainty: the desire for freedom resides in every\nhuman heart, and that desire cannot be contained\nforever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police.\nOver time and across the Earth, freedom will find a\nway.\nFreedom is finding a way in Iraq and\nAfghanistan, and we must continue to show our\ncommitment to democracies in those nations. The\nliberty that many have won at a cost must be secured.\nAs Members of the United Nations, we all have a stake\nin the success of the world\u2019s newest democracies. Not\nlong ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul\nthreatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Those\nregimes destabilized one of the world\u2019s most vital and\nmost volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples in\ndefiance of all civilized norms.\nToday, the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on the\npath to democracy and freedom. The Governments that\nare rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of\nharbouring terrorists, they are fighting terrorist groups.\nAnd this progress is good for the long-term security of\nall of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary\ncourage under difficult conditions. They are fighting to\ndefend their nation from Taliban hold-outs and helping\nto strike against the terrorist killers. They are reviving\ntheir economy. They have adopted a Constitution\nthat protects the rights of all, while honouring their\nnation\u2019s most cherished traditions. More than 10\nmillion Afghan citizens \u2014 over four million of them\nwomen \u2014 are now registered to vote in next month\u2019s\npresidential election. To any who still would question\nwhether Muslim societies can be democratic societies,\nthe Afghan people are giving their answer.\nSince the last general debate of this General\nAssembly, the people of Iraq have regained\nsovereignty. Today, in this Hall, the Prime Minister of\nIraq and his delegation represent a country that has\nrejoined the community of nations. The Government of\nPrime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every\nnation that believes in self-determination and desires\npeace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511\n(2003) and 1546 (2004), the world is providing that\nsupport. The United Nations and its Member nations\nmust respond to Prime Minister Allawi\u2019s request and\ndo more to help build an Iraq that is secure,\ndemocratic, federal and free.\nA democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies because\nterrorists know the stakes in that country. They know\nthat a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a\ndecisive blow against their ambitions for that region.\nSo a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is now\none of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq\ntoday, conducting a campaign of bombings against\ncivilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition\nforces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists\nand foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around the\nworld will never have to face them within our own\nborders.\nOur coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi\nsecurity force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nis providing vital training to that force. More than 35\nnations have contributed money and expertise to help\nrebuild Iraq\u2019s infrastructure and, as the Iraqi Interim\nGovernment moves towards national elections,\nofficials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis\nbuild the infrastructure of democracy. Those selfless\npeople are doing heroic work and are carrying on the\ngreat legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello.\nAs we have seen in other countries, one of the\nmain terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt and\ninfluence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist\nattacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach\nnational elections. The work ahead is demanding, but\nthose difficulties will not shake our conviction that the\nfuture of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty.\nThe proper response to difficulty is not to retreat \u2014 it\nis to prevail.\nThe advance of freedom always carries a cost,\npaid by the bravest among us. America mourns the\nlosses to our nation and to many others, and today I\nassure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every\nenemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of\nAfghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and\nsecurity are fulfilled.\nThese two nations will be a model for the broader\nMiddle East, a region where millions have been denied\nbasic human rights and simple justice. For too long,\nmany nations, including my own, tolerated and even\nexcused oppression in the Middle East in the name of\nstability. Oppression became common, but stability\nnever arrived. We must take a different approach. We\nmust help the reformers of the Middle East as they\nwork for freedom and strive to build a community of\npeaceful, democratic nations.\n11\n\nThat commitment to democratic reform is\nessential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace\nwill not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who\nintimidate opposition, tolerate corruption and maintain\nties to terrorist groups. The long-suffering Palestinian\npeople deserve better. They deserve true leaders\ncapable of creating and governing a free and peaceful\nPalestinian State.\nEven after the setbacks and frustrations of recent\nmonths, good will and hard effort can achieve the\npromise of the road map to peace. Those who would\nlead a new Palestinian State should adopt peaceful\nmeans to achieve the rights of their people and create\nthe reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab\nStates should end incitement in their own media, cut\noff public and private funding for terrorism, and\nestablish normal relations with Israel. Israel should\nimpose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized\noutposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian\npeople, and avoid any actions that prejudice final\nnegotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all\nfavour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails\nhis people and betrays their cause.\nThe democratic hopes we see growing in the\nMiddle East are growing everywhere. In the words of\nthe Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi:\n\u201cWe do not accept the notion that democracy is a\nWestern value. To the contrary, democracy simply\nmeans good Government rooted in responsibility,\ntransparency and accountability.\u201d\nHere at the United Nations, Members know this to be\ntrue. In recent years, this Organization has helped\ncreate a new democracy in East Timor and the United\nNations has aided other nations in making the\ntransition to self-rule.\nBecause I believe that the advance of liberty is\nthe path to both a safer and better world, today I\npropose establishing a democracy fund within the\nUnited Nations. This is a great calling for this great\nOrganization. The fund would help countries lay the\nfoundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law,\nindependent courts, a free press, political parties and\ntrade unions. Money from the fund would also help set\nup voter precincts and polling places and support the\nwork of election monitors. To show our commitment to\nthe new democracy fund, the United States will make\nan initial contribution, and I urge all other nations to\ncontribute as well.\nToday I have outlined a broad agenda to advance\nhuman dignity and enhance the security of all of us.\nThe defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the\nspread of prosperity, the advance of democracy \u2014\nthese causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the\nworld. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together\nwe can accomplish so much more.\nHistory will honour the high ideals of this\nOrganization. The Charter states them with clarity: \u201cto\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...\nto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\nlarger freedom\u201d.\nLet history also record that our generation of\nleaders followed through on these ideals, even in\nadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade,\nmembers of the United Nations did not grow weary in\nour duties, or waver in meeting them. I am confident\nthat this young century will be liberty\u2019s century. I\nbelieve we will rise to this moment, because I know the\ncharacter of so many nations and leaders represented\nhere today. And I have faith in the transforming power\nof freedom.\nMay God bless you."

        "file_text": "There are some matters on\nwhich we all agree. One of these is that, later this year,\nwe will receive the important report that will be tabled\nby the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange, which was constituted by our Secretary-\nGeneral. The other is that, next year, we will mark the\ntenth anniversaries of the Copenhagen World Summit\non Sustainable Development and the Beijing World\nConference on Women and discuss their outcomes. The\nthird matter on which we all agree is that, next year, we\nwill observe the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the\nhistoric Millennium Declaration.\nWe will also agree that we took all these\ninitiatives \u00f3 the convening of the social, women\u00eds and\nmillennium summits and the constitution of the High-\nLevel Panel \u00f3 because we were of one mind that we\nhad a number of problems that needed to be solved. In\nthe Millennium Declaration, we used inspiring words\nto sum up our response to these problems. We said:\n\u00ecWe have a collective responsibility to uphold the\nprinciples of human dignity, equality and equity\nat the global level. As leaders we have a duty\ntherefore to all the world's people, especially the\nmost vulnerable and, in particular, the children of\nthe world, to whom the future belongs.\u00ee\n(resolution 55/2, para. 2)\nWe went on to say:\n\u00ecWe are determined to establish a just and lasting\npeace all over the world in accordance with the\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\u00ee (ibid.,\npara. 4)\nWe also said that our efforts to make globalization\nfully inclusive and equitable\n'must include policies and measures, at the\nglobal level, which correspond to the needs of\ndeveloping countries and economies in transition\nand are formulated and implemented with their\neffective participation'. (ibid., para. 5)\nTo this we added the commitment that\n'We will spare no effort to free our fellow men,\nwomen and children from the abject and\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty'.\n'We are committed to making the right to\ndevelopment a reality for everyone and to freeing\nthe entire human race from want.' (ibid.,\npara. 11)\nNaturally, we have no choice but to agree that we\ndid say all these things and would undoubtedly agree\nthat we meant what we said. I trust that this will not\nmark the end of the range of issues over which we\nwould speak with one voice. I say this because, when I\nhave asked myself the question 'Have we achieved the\ngoals we set ourselves?', I have found it impossible\nnot to answer that we have failed. There may very well\nbe others among us who will take a different view and\nsay that a good beginning has been made and therefore\nthat it is too early to say we have failed.\nBut I am certain that if we say to those affected\nby violence and war that we have made a good\nbeginning towards the establishment of a just and\n11\n\nlasting peace all over the world, they will not believe\nus. I am equally certain that if we say to those who go\nto bed hungry every day that we have made a good\nbeginning towards freeing the entire human race from\nwant, they will also not believe us.\nI would make bold to say that the vision of\nhuman dignity, equality and equity at the global level\nthat we enunciated in this imposing forum four years\nago resonates among the ordinary people who are\nvictims of hunger and war as a beautiful dream that\nwill inevitably be deferred.\nDoes this mean that, when we made the promises\nwe made, we deliberately intended to tell the billions\nof ordinary people a lie? The answer to that question is\nobviously \u00ecno\u00ee. Did we speak as we did simply\nbecause talk is easy and cheap? Again, the answer to\nthat question is obviously 'no'. The question must\ntherefore arise as to why the grandeur of our words and\nthe vision they paint \u00f3 of a world of peace, free of\nwar, a world characterized by shared prosperity, free of\npoverty - has not produced the grand results we\nsincerely sought and seek.\nIt would seem to me that the answer to that\nquestion lies in the fact that we have as yet not\nseriously confronted the difficult issues that relate to\nthe uses and perhaps the abuses of power. Yesterday, in\nhis statement on his report on the work of the\nOrganization, our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nspoke eloquently about the 3,000-year-old Code of\nHammurabi, and said: 'That code was a landmark in\nmankind\u00eds struggle to build an order where, instead of\nmight making right, right would make might'\n(). We took it that the Secretary-General was,\nin his own elegant way, drawing our attention to the\ncentral question of our day: the uses and abuses of\npower.\nContemporary human society is characterized by\na gross and entrenched imbalance in the distribution of\npower. That power is held and exercised by human\nbeings. As human beings, the powerful share many\nthings with the powerless. Together, the powerful and\nthe disempowered share the common human needs to\neat, to drink water, to be protected from the elements,\nto dream, to love, to laugh, to play, and to live.\nBut life itself tells us that all of that describes\nonly what human beings share. The rest, the relations\namong us as social beings, is defined by our varied\naccess to power and its exercise.\nWithout fear of contradiction, I have said that we\nall agree that later this year we will receive the report\nof the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange. I am equally convinced that, depending on\nwhere we stand relative to the power equation, we will\nhold radically different views about what constitutes\nhumanity's most serious threats and challenges, and\ntherefore what must be changed to respond to that\nperceived reality.\nBoth the powerful and the disempowered will\nundoubtedly agree that terrorism and war represent a\nserious threat to all humanity. They will agree that we\nwere right to make the commitment in the Millennium\nDeclaration to work for\n'a just and lasting peace all over the world in\naccordance with the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter' (resolution 55/2, para. 4).\nMany of those who have already addressed the\nAssembly have correctly drawn our attention to many\ninstances of terrorism and war, to which we are all\nopposed. They have spoken of the bombings of the\nUnited States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and of\nthe African and American lives those claimed; of the\nheinous 11 September outrage in this city; and of the\nacts of terrorism in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Morocco,\nSpain, Israel, Gatumba in Burundi, Beslan in the\nRussian Federation, and elsewhere.\nThey have correctly drawn our attention to the\nviolent conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\nBurundi, the Sudan, Palestine, Israel, Iraq,\nAfghanistan, Chechnya, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and\nelsewhere, and to other unsolved problems, such as\nself-determination for the people of Western Sahara,\nthat cry out for a solution.\nBoth the powerful and the disempowered agree\nthat the international community must act together\nsuccessfully to confront these situations and therefore\nthe threat and challenge of terrorism and war.\nHowever, the powerful will also make the\nadditional determination that terrorism and war\nconstitute the central and principal threat and challenge\nthat human civilization faces. They will make that\ndetermination because, almost by definition, the\nterrorists target them simply because they are\npowerful; they have no logical choice but to identify\nterrorism as the central and principal threat and\nchallenge they face, and to which they must respond.\n12\n\nBecause of their place in the power equation,\nwhat they decide will necessarily represent the global\ndecision of what constitutes the central, principal and\nmost urgent threat and challenge to human society,\nnecessitating various changes in the global system of\ngovernance. What they decide will translate into a set\nof obligatory injunctions, issued by this Organization,\nwhich all Member nations will have to accept and\nimplement.\nAgain, both the powerful and the disempowered\nwill undoubtedly also agree that poverty, want and\nunderdevelopment constitute serious problems that all\nhumanity must confront. Many of those who have\nalready addressed the Assembly have correctly drawn\nour attention to the reality of poverty, which billions\nacross the globe continue to experience.\nAmong other things, they have correctly\nreminded us of the fact that some countries are poorer\ntoday than they were a decade ago. They have pointed\nto the virtual certainty that we will fail to meet the\nMillennium Development Goals we set ourselves four\nyears ago.\nBoth the powerful and the disempowered agree\nthat the international community must act together\nsuccessfully to confront this situation, and therefore\nthe threat and challenge of poverty and\nunderdevelopment. However, the disempowered, who\nare also the poor of the world, will also make the\nadditional determination that poverty and\nunderdevelopment constitute the central and principal\nthreat and challenge that human civilization faces.\nThey will make the determination that, because\nthey are the daily victims of deprivation and want,\nwhich claim the lives of millions every year \u00f3\ntranslating into cold statistics about shortened life\nexpectancy - deprivation and want represent the\ncentral and principal threat and challenge that\nhumanity faces, necessitating changes in the global\nsystem of governance in order effectively to respond to\nthat reality.\nBut because they are powerless, those billions -\nthe overwhelming majority of the same humanity that\nneeds to eat, to drink water, to be protected from the\nelements, to dream, to love, to laugh, to play, to live -\nwill have no possibility of persuading this\nOrganization, laughably described in the Millennium\nDeclaration as 'the most universal and most\nrepresentative Organization in the world', to translate\nwhat they have concluded into obligatory injunctions,\nissued by this Organization, which all Member nations\nwill have to accept and implement.\nIf, for a moment, we resist the temptation to\nspeak in parables or in tongues, for fear that we might\nbe punished for telling the truth, we must say that this\nstark and simple reality reflects the distribution of\npower and wealth in contemporary human society.\nThe wealthy and powerful feel, correctly,\nmortally threatened by the fanatical rage of the\nterrorists. They have the power to respond to this\npresent and immediate danger with all their might, and,\nbecause they are mighty, they can determine for all\nhumanity that the principal threat to them is the\nprincipal threat that all humanity faces.\nThe poor and powerless feel threatened by a\npermanent hurricane of poverty, which is devastating\ntheir communities as horrendously as hurricane Ivan\ndestroyed the Caribbean island State of Grenada.\nBut, tragically, because they are poor, they do not\nhave the means to respond to this present and\nimmediate danger. Neither do they have the power to\ndetermine for all humanity that what they decide is the\nprincipal threat they confront, is also the principal\nthreat that all humanity, including the rich and\npowerful, faces.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, we spoke of the\nneed to implement\n'policies and measures, at the global level, which\ncorrespond to the needs of developing countries\nand economies in transition and are formulated\nand implemented with their effective\nparticipation' (ibid., para. 5).\nPerhaps the mistake we made was to assume that\nthe contemporary distribution of power in human\nsociety would permit this outcome, and that, regardless\nof this fundamental consideration, it would be possible\nfor the concerns of the poor to take precedence on the\nglobal agenda and the global programme of action.\nWe comforted, or perhaps deluded, ourselves\nwith the thought that this Organization is 'the most\nuniversal and most representative organization in the\nworld' - afraid to ask the question, is it?\nEvery year many of us who have spoken, and will\nspeak, from this rostrum make an annual pilgrimage to\nthis great and vibrant city to plead the cause of the\n13\n\npoor of the world, hopeful that this time our voices will\nbe heard. Every year, after a few days, we pack up our\nbags to return to the reality of our societies, whose\nsqualor stands out in sharp contrast to the splendour of\nNew York and this majestic precinct that constitutes\nthe headquarters of the United Nations.\nIn the aftermath, resolutions are passed. Again\nand again our permanent representatives, with their\nextraordinary and plenipotentiary powers, report that\nthose resolutions oblige us to act to thwart the deadly\nplans of murderous terrorist gangs. Again and again\nthey report that yet another appeal has been made to\nthe mighty and the lowly alike, voluntarily to respond\nto the cries of the wretched of the earth.\nWe are truly proud and inspired to see you,\nMr. President, presiding over the proceedings of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, because we\nknow that you will discharge your obligations as a son\nof the poor of the world should. We are moved by the\nfact that you had as your predecessor President Julian\nHunte, who also understood intimately what must be\ndone to ensure that the United Nations can become, in\nreality, the indispensable common house of the entire\nhuman family.\nAs an Israeli said to us at our headquarters in\nPretoria a fortnight ago, it is perhaps time that we, the\npoor and powerless, abandon our wheelchairs and\nbegin to walk unaided. Perhaps that will help to build\nthe social order of which Hammurabi - and Kofi\nAnnan - spoke, in which right makes might and not\nmight, right."

        "file_text": "I would\nlike to begin by expressing our appreciation to\nMr. Julian Hunte, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint\nLucia, for his accomplished and skilful leadership of\nthe General Assembly during its previous session.\nI would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session.\nI would also like to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the great wisdom that he\nhas shown in the discharge of his functions. He\ndeserves our respect and appreciation, and we extend\nto him our support and solidarity.\nMy country has reached a crucial point in its\nhistory. It faces the challenge of living up to the\nexpectations raised by the end of the internal armed\nconflict. Since January, when I assumed office, the\nfrustrated hopes of all of our people have been\nrekindled.\nMy plan of government is predicated on the peace\nagreements and defines their implementation as a\ncommitment of the whole nation. As President of\n11\n\nGuatemala, I endorse fully the principle that a firm and\nlasting peace must be based on participatory socio-\neconomic development, aimed at achieving the\ncommon good and responding to the needs of all of our\npeople, particularly those still living in extreme\npoverty.\nSince I took office, I have made a point of\nlistening to the opinions of all of our citizens. That has\nenabled me to identify the constraints facing\nGuatemala, which it must overcome if it is to deal\nadequately with the many legitimate social demands\nand expectations.\nThe actions that my Government intends to take\nin the period 2004 to 2008 will focus on four areas:\nsocial investment; conditions of production;\nenvironmental sustainability; and security for all.\nThose policies are being carried out within the\nframework of the principles of solidarity and\ninclusiveness; decentralization and participation; and\ntransparency in public actions. Those areas of action\nand principles accord fully with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nI would like to single out a number of\nachievements resulting from our new approach to\ngovernment. We have reduced our troop strength by\n43 per cent and have begun to modernize the armed\nforces and to make them more professional, consistent\nwith the functions that they are required to perform in\ntime of peace. This includes, at the international level,\ngreater participation by the Guatemalan army in United\nNations peace operations, for example in Haiti.\nIn terms of public spending, we are according\npriority to education, health, security, citizenship and\ninfrastructure.\nWe are fighting petty crime, gang-related crime\nand organized crime, focusing in particular on\ncombating drug trafficking, terrorism, smuggling,\nmoney laundering, trafficking in persons and the illegal\narms trade, all of which represent a huge challenge that\ncannot be overcome without the support of the\ninternational community.\nWe are waging an all-out war against corruption,\nand creating mechanisms to ensure transparency in\npublic procurement and contracting. For the first time\nin the history of our country, charges of corruption are\nbeing investigated, and those found guilty will be\nprosecuted.\nWe have adopted a series of measures aimed at\nelaborating and implementing a fiscal pact. Sustained\nefforts are being made to meet the taxation goals set\nout in the peace agreements, within the framework of\nmy Government\u2019s objectives for economic growth.\nWe have, as a matter of priority, established a\nnational front against hunger and malnutrition.\nWorking with civil society, we have elaborated a policy\non food and nutritional security.\nWe have consolidated our responsible approach\nto macroeconomic management; that is necessary if we\nare to promote competitiveness and productive\ninvestment and ensure the well-being of all\nGuatemalans. In this context, we launched a\nprogramme for economic and social recovery, entitled\nVamos Guatemala.\nWe have taken firm measures to eliminate\nextreme poverty and reduce social exclusion, while\nfully respecting our diversity \u2014 for Guatemala is a\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual country.\nMy Government is committed to full respect for\nhuman rights. We believe that every Guatemalan\nshould enjoy basic rights and fundamental freedoms,\nand that the right to development must be ensured. In\nthis context, Guatemala will cooperate with\ninternational bodies that promote and protect human\nrights.\nMy Government\u2019s foreign policy is consistent\nwith its national interests. Our guiding principle is the\nneed to ensure that Guatemala can take its proper place\nin today\u2019s globalized world, as well as to strengthen\nmultilateralism and regional integration.\nThe presidents of the Central American countries\nhave given greater impetus to our integration process.\nThis year, we took the decisions required to bring to\nfruition a customs union between El Salvador,\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\nMy Government is proposing a new beginning in\nits bilateral relationship with Belize. We must reach a\npermanent, just, equitable and honourable settlement of\nthe territorial dispute between the two countries, while\nat the same time making a constructive effort to resolve\nthe socio-economic problems afflicting our peoples.\nThat is why my Government is promoting joint\nprojects relating to production, a trade agreement,\ngreater flexibility in the transit of persons, goods and\nservices, full observance of human rights and the\n12\n\nconclusion of agreements for mutual legal assistance,\nall of which will contribute to the progress of our\npeoples and to the security of the region.\nThe Central American countries have just\nconcluded trade negotiations with the United States.\nLast May, at the Guadalajara Summit, an\nannouncement was made regarding the initiation of a\nprocess leading up to an association agreement\nbetween Central America and the European Union, to\ninclude a free trade agreement. We will shortly be\nsigning a trade agreement with Colombia, and we hope\nto conclude free trade agreements with Taiwan,\nMERCOSUR, the Andean Group and the Caribbean\nCommunity.\nLooking after the interests of Guatemalan\nemigrants is also a priority issue for my Government.\nWe provide support for them as they seek solutions to\ntheir problems and respect for their fundamental rights.\nWe are in contact with the receiving countries,\nparticularly the United States of America, with a view\nto regularizing the situation of emigrants, who make a\nsubstantial contribution to the well-being of their\ncommunities.\nAll the efforts that Guatemala is making to\novercome poverty and achieve socio-economic\ndevelopment necessarily depend on the progress being\nmade in multilateral trade negotiations. Guatemala\nappeals to the international community to fulfil its\nlongstanding commitments to eliminate all the\nmeasures and practices that distort markets, to\nliberalize trade in our products and, more generally, to\nadopt measures enabling a country like Guatemala,\nwhich has been striving to open its economy, to obtain\nbetter opportunities for access to markets for its\nexports.\nMay I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\n(MINUGUA), which, after 10 years of fruitful work, is\nreaching the end of its mandate. MINUGUA has left an\nimportant legacy in our country.\nI would like to turn now to our agenda at this\nsession. We are convinced of the need to adapt the\nOrganization to the new challenges, threats and\nchanges that humanity faces. We trust that 2005 will\noffer us an opportunity to react to them in a responsible\nmanner.\nOne of the most timely issues is the reform of the\nSecurity Council. Our position thereon has been\nevolving, reflecting the imperative need to make that\norgan more representative, transparent and effective.\nWe advocate the expansion of its membership and\ncould agree to such an expansion being applied to both\ncategories of members \u2014 permanent and non-\npermanent \u2014 so long as the need to ensure adequate\ngeographic representation is taken into account. The\nreform of the Security Council would be the point of\ndeparture for the adaptation of all the organs of the\nUnited Nations to the new circumstances. We favour\nthe strengthening of the General Assembly and the\nEconomic and Social Council.\nWe reiterate our complete repudiation of all\nforms of terrorism. We are taking all feasible measures\nat the national level against the scourge and support the\ncollective action of the international community to\ncombat it, inter alia, through the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390\n(2002), as well as participation in the relevant treaties.\nWe are convinced of the need for a stronger\ncollective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts. We\nbelieve that the United Nations should continue to\naddress the imperative of development, including such\nemerging issues as transnational migrations. We also\nfeel that our Organization should play a vital role in\nseeking to ensure that the benefits of globalization are\nwidely distributed among all countries. In that\nconnection, we wish to highlight the significance we\nattach to the Monterrey Consensus and the\nJohannesburg Plan of Action.\nGuatemala is conscious of the divisions that\npersist in the Middle East, Asia and Africa among\nneighbouring countries. We earnestly hope that the\ndisputes between them can be resolved through\ndialogue and other peaceful means, thus enabling all\npeoples of the world to be represented here without\nrejection or discrimination.\nI wish to note in particular our concern over the\nsituation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republic\nof China on Taiwan, whose aspirations to\nrepresentation in international bodies remain\nunfulfilled. We also wish to voice our earnest hope that\nthe difficult situation prevailing in the Middle East,\nwhich has deteriorated of late, will be resolved in\nconformity with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002).\n13\n\nUnder your guidance, Sir, this Assembly will\nhave to address issues of the greatest significance for\nhumankind and the United Nations. Guatemala\nundertakes to participate actively in this year\u2019s debates\nand in the special event to be held just before our next\nregular session. We hasten to offer our cooperation\nwith a view to the success of your endeavours."

        "file_text": "It gives me\npleasure to extend my delegation\u00eds sincere\n41\n\ncongratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his deserved\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly. Given the issues that we must\nconsider during this session, and in view of the\nimportant tasks we must face in the coming year, we\nparticularly welcome the President\u00eds experience and\nskills, which are familiar to us in the African arena.\nWe would also like to extend our thanks and\nappreciation to Mr. Julian R. Hunte, the outgoing\nPresident, for the great efforts he made in conducting\nthe work of the Assembly, as well as to the Secretary-\nGeneral for leading the work of the Organization.\nLast year from this rostrum I stated that\nnegotiations between the Government and the Sudan\nPeople\u00eds Liberation Movement/Army, under the\nauspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD) and Kenya\u00eds chairmanship, and\nwith the support of the IGAD partners, had made great\nprogress and peace had become imminent. I am glad to\nsay that the last round of negotiations resulted in the\nsigning, in the first week of June 2004, of six protocols\ndealing with security arrangements, cessation of\nhostilities, distribution of wealth, power-sharing and\nthe conflict in the Nubian mountains region, the Blue\nNile and Abiai. We decided to hold the last round of\nnegotiations on 7 October 2004 to complete the details\nof a comprehensive peace, which will, it is hoped, be\nsigned at the end of this year.\nWe stand on the threshold of peace. The new\nchallenge before us now is to overcome the differences\nof the past, start reconstruction and rehabilitation,\nconcentrate on development and strengthen the pillars\nof peace and national unity on the basis of\ncompatriotism and equality of rights and duties. For\nthat reason, my Government declares its firm intention\nof conducting a national dialogue with all political\nforces, inside and outside the Sudan, in order to make\npeace a national objective that can be achieved through\na national charter.\nIt also gives me pleasure to say that in addition to\nthe talks in Naivasha and Abuja my Government\nstarted a third forum in Cairo, under the auspices of the\nEgyptian Government, to engage in dialogue with\nfactions of the national opposition, headquartered in\nAsmara.\nBecause war has devastated all sectors of the\ncountry, reconstruction efforts are especially difficult.\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the\ninternational community for the humanitarian assistance\nthey provided during the war. We now appeal to the\ninternational community to help in the reconstruction\nprocess: to ameliorate the living conditions in the areas\ndevastated by war all over the Sudan; to aid in the\nresettlement of internally displaced persons and\nrefugees; and to participate in development projects in\norder to achieve peace and stability.\nWe were at the threshold of peace in the south\nwhen another war broke out in Darfur as the result of a\nrebel movement begun by some tribes and supported\nby foreign forces. The rebel movement\u00eds terrorist\naction was not directed against the Government only,\nbut against those tribes that refused to join them. That,\nin turn, pushed those tribes to train and arm militias to\ndefend themselves against the rebels. The rebel\nmovement targeted the security apparatus, sowing\ndeath and destruction, which led to the release of criminal\nJanjaweed groups from prisons. The aggression continued\nagainst civilians and Government institutions.\nThe root causes of Darfur go back to conflicts\namong the tribal communities in the region. Previously,\nthose conflicts were settled according to traditional\ncustoms and norms. But the growth in population and\nthe number of livestock, coupled with a decrease in the\nwater supply owing to desertification, led to tense\nstruggles between grazing land tribes and farmers.\nThere were other causes for regional conflict: an influx\nof arms and the interference of neighbouring countries\nthat tried to exploit the tense situation, encouraging\nrebellions against the Government by training and\narming certain groups.\nThe present conflict in Darfur started in March\n2003, when rebels started inciting dissension and strife,\nattacking highways, plundering livestock and taking\ninternational relief workers as hostages. The\nGovernment tried to convince them to abandon military\naction, but they insisted on occupying cities and\nvillages and terrorizing tribes, forcing them into armed\nservice. Everyone had to carry weapons for self-\ndefence. Then, the Government intervened to try to\nhalt the hostilities, impose law and order and prevent\ncivil war.\nThis conflict, which was imposed on the\nGovernment, has created extremely complicated and\ndire humanitarian conditions. The Government took the\nnecessary measures. It sent food relief to Darfur. Next,\nit eliminated all the administrative, legal and technical\n42\n\narrangements that impeded relief work, it allowed\nrelief organizations to enter Darfur unimpeded, and it\ncurtailed certain regulations, such as visa requirements,\nin order to provide protection to camps of displaced\npersons. The Government deployed police and\nreopened legal offices destroyed by the rebels. The\nprocess of bringing all of those accused of violating\nhuman rights to justice began. Furthermore, the\nGovernment cooperated with the international\ncommunity by signing a joint communique with the\nSecretary-General that includes a number of measures\nto deal with the situation in Darfur and, together with\nJan Pronk, Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for the Sudan, I headed a Joint Implementation\nMechanism mission to the area.\nFurthermore, out of its belief in a peaceful\nsettlement as a strategic choice, the Government\nentered into negotiations with the rebels under the\nauspices of the President of Chad, which culminated in\nthe Abashi agreement in 2003, but that agreement was\nlater violated by the rebels. However, this did not\nweaken the Government\u00eds resolve to continue its\nefforts, until we attained the ceasefire agreement in\nN\u00edDjamena. In order to cooperate with the African\nUnion, we sent a high-level delegation to the first\nround of negotiations at Addis Ababa; our delegation\nwas given full authority to reach a peaceful settlement\nwith the rebels. But the rebels boycotted the talks.\nThe Government redoubled its efforts at all\nlevels - political, security and humanitarian - out of\nits responsibility for the people, and it cooperated fully\nwith the United Nations so as to implement the\nagreement that had been reached with the Secretary-\nGeneral. Then, on 30 July 2004, the Security Council\nadopted resolution 1556 (2004), which gave the\nGovernment only one month to deal with the problem\nand threatened the imposition of sanctions. It is\nregrettable that this resolution sent an erroneous\nmessage, thus encouraging the rebels to give up\nnegotiations with good intention. They insisted on\nconditions that were impossible to implement. And this\nled to the collapse of negotiations in Addis Ababa, in\nspite of the African Union\u00eds great efforts.\nNotwithstanding the faults and impracticality of\nthis Security Council resolution, my Government,\nabiding by its international legitimacy and\nresponsibility for its people, will continue to do its\nutmost to find the shortest way for the return of peace,\nstability and security to Darfur. My Government signed\na working plan for Darfur with the United Nations; this\nplan included detailed arrangements for humanitarian\naid, security and protection of displaced persons and\ntheir voluntary return. We assigned extra police forces,\nnumbering 10,000. We also signed an agreement with\nthe International Organization for Migration on the\nreturn of refugees.\nWithin the framework of a political settlement,\nand despite the intransigence and lack of seriousness of\nthe rebels, my Government accepted the invitation\nextended by President Obasanjo of Nigeria, the current\nChairman of the African Union. We then sent another\nhigh-ranking delegation to Abuja on 23 August out of\nour belief in the political settlement as a strategic\noption. As it happened in the Addis Ababa\nnegotiations, the Security Council adopted its\nresolution 1564 (2004) last Saturday, 18 September,\nwhich gave more incentive to the rebels and sent them\nan erroneous message to continue their intransigence.\nThis led to the failure of the negotiations.\nSecurity Council resolution 1564 (2004) did not\nconsider my Government\u00eds efforts to contain the\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur, which led to d\u00c8tente in\nthe situation. It did not pay attention to my\nGovernment\u00eds warning about the negative impact of\nany measures that would hamper the efforts made by\nthe African Union for the peaceful settlement of the\nquestion of Darfur.\nWe call upon the international community to\nprovide assistance to the needy population in Darfur.\nAt the same time, we ask for support and promotion of\nthe African Union's efforts and that the situation on the\nground not be further complicated or the Union\u00eds\nefforts undermined.\nBelieving in our own principles, our sense of\nresponsibility and the attention my Government\nattaches to human rights questions, we have cooperated\nwith international and voluntary organizations for the\ndevelopment and enhancement of human rights in my\ncountry. We have ratified this year the African\nChildren's Initiative and, over the past months, we\nhave received some independent experts and special\nrapporteurs sent by the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In\ncooperation with OHCHR, we have deployed a team of\nhuman rights observers in Darfur. Sudan's doors will\nbe open for all those who want to know the truth. We\nhave nothing to hide. Our efforts were not limited to\n43\n\ncooperating with the international community. We have\ntaken some measures at the local level, and we have\nestablished a national independent committee to\ninvestigate allegations of human rights violations in\nDarfur. Also, there are other committees to investigate\nthe other claims of rape in the Darfur region besides\nour efforts to provide protection, peace and security to\nour citizens.\nSince the beginning of the crisis, my Government\nhas not hesitated to recognize that there has been a\nhumanitarian problem in Darfur and a security problem\nthat ought to be dealt with through a comprehensive\npolitical solution, despite the fact that the rebel\nmovement led to this problem by starting violence and\nfighting. Then we resorted to the international\ncommunity in general and the African Union and the\nLeague of Arab States in particular.\nWe hope that the international community,\nespecially the Security Council, will cooperate with us\nto find a solution instead of issuing threats and\ncondemnations. The last Security Council resolution is\na living example of such threats.\nWe welcome the international community\u00eds\ninvestigation of the Darfur violations. As I said, we\nhave nothing to hide. What we all want from the\nSecretary-General, who is responsible for the\nestablishment of this committee, and from the Security\nCouncil is confirmation of the credibility of the\ninternational organization so that this international\ncommittee would be neutral and professional. We do\nnot want a committee like that headed by Richard\nButler, who prepared his report at another location\nwhere it was signed and submitted to the Security\nCouncil indicating that it represented the position of\nthe Organization.\nWe hope that the voices of those who took certain\npositions regarding Darfur will be silent until the\ninternational committee\u00eds report is issued. We face a\nvery delicate situation and developments in the world\ntoday, and we need to face such challenges by\ngarnering the political will to enhance the role of the\nUnited Nations and its agencies in order to carry out\ntheir functions within the framework of a real\ndemocracy that would express the interests and hopes\nof all peoples and confront the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century.\nWe must accelerate our current efforts that have\nbeen going on for a decade now for Security Council\nreform and to develop its methods of work. The body\nthat is responsible for international peace and security\nis composed of permanent members, whose monopoly\nof the veto reflects a great imbalance over the simplest\ncriteria of justice. Among the five permanent\nMembers, there are three from one geographical group;\ntwo of them are from Western Europe. There is no\nrepresentation whatsoever for entire continents, such as\nAfrica or Latin America, and vast regions of Asia.\nTherefore, any discussion about submitting another\ncandidate from Western Europe before taking these\ncontinents into consideration would be a consecration\nof this imbalanced equation and of the West\u00eds\nhegemony over the affairs of this Organization.\nTerrorism and extremism are among the\nchallenges facing the world today. We declare our total\nrejection and condemnation of this destructive\nphenomenon; but at the same time there is an\nunacceptable misunderstanding and confusion between\nterrorism and the struggles of people to achieve their\nindependence and to rid themselves of foreign\noccupation. This misunderstanding culminates in the\nextreme when terrorism is linked to followers of a\ncertain religion or culture. Terrorism has no religion or\nhomeland. We stand with the international community\nand cooperate with it in its fight to eliminate terrorism,\nand we call for an international agreement on a\ndefinition of terrorism and to find the best means to\nface this plague through collective efforts.\nThe gap between the rich and poor countries is\nwidening within a system of globalization that further\nenriches the wealthy and impoverishes the poor. It has\nbecome an obstacle for the international community\nand the aspirations to a free and dignified life of\nbillions of people in developing countries. The\nimbalance in today\u00eds world economy and free trade is\nobvious. It will have an adverse effect not only on the\ndeveloping countries but will lead also to total\ncatastrophe in the whole world. We need to have\npolitical resolve, as stated by world leaders in the\nMillennium Declaration four years ago, and later at\nMonterrey and Johannesburg.\nDeveloping and least developed countries are still\nsuffering from hunger and poverty.\nLet us renew hope for the hundreds of millions of\npoor and hungry people by translating that political\nwill into concrete action in order to provide them with\neducation and drinking water and to eliminate hunger,\n44\n\ndestitution and disease by focusing on the goals and\nprogrammes that we have repeatedly agreed on. In this\nconnection, we would like to pay tribute to the\ninternational initiative on the new Action Against\nHunger and Poverty.\nIsrael\u00eds oppressive policies against unarmed\nPalestinian people, the imposition of closures on\noccupied Palestinian land, the extrajudicial crimes\ncommitted there, the demolition of houses, the\nstarvation and intimidation, the increased settlement\nactivities and the besieging of the Palestinian President\nall require that the international community bring\npressure to bear on Israel to stop those acts. The Sudan\nwelcomes the advisory opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice on the illegality of the separation wall\nand on compensation for all losses caused by it. We\nwelcome resolution ES-10/15, adopted by the General\nAssembly at its tenth emergency session, on 20 July\n2004, demanding that Israel abide by that opinion. An\ninternational, comprehensive and just peace in the\nMiddle East will be reached only when Israel\nwithdraws from all occupied Arab lands, including the\nSyrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese Shali\u00eda farms.\nThere will be no peace or stability until the Palestinian\npeople recover their legitimate rights, including their\nright to establish an independent Palestinian State with\nJerusalem as its capital and the right of refugees to\nreturn to their lands.\nThe difficult situation facing the Iraqi people\nmakes it necessary to assist them to overcome their\nproblems. Here we reaffirm the unity and independence\nof the Iraqi people and their right to self-determination.\nWe hope that the restoration of those rights will lead to\nsecurity and stability and to a return to normality in\nIraq and that it will enable the Iraqi people to exercise\ntheir right to choose their own political leadership\nthrough free and fair elections. We call upon the\ninternational community to support the Iraqi\nprovisional Government, to help in the reconstruction\nof Iraq and to support any initiative that would enable\nthe Iraqis to live in dignity in their own country.\nOur efforts complement those efforts of the\nAfrican Union to achieve stability and development in\nour continent, a continent so rich natural and human\nresources and capabilities. We have resolved to settle\nour conflicts and crises, which squander such resources\nand capabilities, and to work instead to promote\neconomic and social development through the New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development (NEPAD).\nIn conclusion, we reaffirm our determination to\nachieve a comprehensive and just peace that would\nlead to stability and well-being for the people of the\nSudan and would bolster African Union efforts towards\neconomic and social integrity. We look forward to the\nUnited Nations playing its role in establishing justice\nin international relations based on understanding,\ncooperation and mutual interests and avoiding\nconfrontation and sanctions, which have proven to be\nharmful to people."

This is therefore my very last attendance\nof a session of the General Assembly in my capacity as\nHead of State and Government.\nAfter the elections, I will join civil society and\ncontinue to make my humble contribution to the efforts\non the prevailing challenges still facing Mozambique,\nAfrica and the world, particularly in the areas of peace\nand the promotion of cultural, social and economic\ndevelopment.\n5\n\nI have been attending sessions of the General\nAssembly since 1975, first in my capacity as Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs and then as President of\nMozambique. I cherish every moment I have spent here\nat the United Nations, as part of the global efforts to\ncollectively find solutions to the problems around the\nworld. It has been, indeed, quite a rewarding\nexperience as, through our common resolve, we have\nbeen able to successfully advance the decolonization\nprocess in Africa and elsewhere, while engaging in the\nstruggle for peace and stability, poverty eradication and\ndevelopment.\nAs I depart, allow me to share some reflections\non the role played by our universal Organization, the\nUnited Nations. Reaffirming the inalienable right of all\npeoples to self-determination and independence, in\naccordance with the principles and objectives set forth\nin the Charter of the United Nations and General\nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV), Mozambique attained\nits independence from colonial rule in 1975. Since\nthen, the country has been actively involved in the\nUnited Nations, has progressively improved its\nrelations with the Organization and its related bodies\nand has received strong, multidisciplinary support.\nSince then, 60 territories worldwide have become\ndecolonized, and millions of people today are able to\nexercise their right to self-determination.\nIt was on 16 September 1975 that, for the first\ntime, I had the privilege of addressing the General\nAssembly from this rostrum. I was then the Foreign\nMinister of my country, and I was expressing the\ngratitude of the people and the Government of\nMozambique for our admission as a Member of the\nUnited Nations.\nWhen Mozambique was admitted, the United\nNations was composed of 144 Member States,\ncompared to 191 in 2004. That shows the extent of the\ngrowth of our Organization. In Africa, countries such\nas Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and\nWestern Sahara were not yet independent or were\nunder apartheid domination. On other continents, the\nsituation was very similar.\nThe cold war was at its peak and the arms race\nwas a dominant feature of international politics. The\nfocus of the Non-Aligned Movement was on\nadvocating the interests of the developing countries, on\nraising international awareness of the dangers and risks\nof a nuclear confrontation and on the struggle for the\nestablishment of a new international economic order.\nIn those days of high political tensions, international\ndialogue was characterized by confrontation and\nintolerance. Today, international dialogue is more one\nof consultation and the search for consensus. The\nconstructive dialogue existing among Africa and the\nGroup of Eight, the European Union, the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations, the South American\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and other regional\ngroupings are good examples of the prevailing new\ninternational political mood. Throughout this process,\nthe United Nations has played an important role.\nSoon after its independence, my country had to\nface the economic and social consequences stemming\nfrom its decision to close its border with Southern\nRhodesia, in compliance with a United Nations\nresolution that imposed sanctions on that neighbouring\nTerritory. It was a costly measure, but because it\nachieved its aim of ending the illegal regime in that\nTerritory, we feel proud to have taken that action.\nDuring that period, Mozambique enjoyed\nimportant support from the United Nations, particularly\nin the areas of health, education, rural development,\nadvocacy and emergency assistance for the victims of\nwar and natural disasters.\nFollowing many years of a destabilizing war, the\nGovernment and the Mozambique National Resistance\n(RENAMO), the former guerrilla group, signed the\nGeneral Peace Agreement on 4 October 1992. Soon\nafter the signing of the Agreement, the Security\nCouncil approved the establishment of the United\nNations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) to\nmonitor and verify its implementation.\nWe deeply appreciate the resolute and decisive\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the peace\nprocess, with the mobilization of human, material and\nfinancial resources. That strong support from the\ninternational community, combined with our people\u00eds\nwill and determination to achieve peace, led to what\nmany regard as the first example of a successful United\nNations peacekeeping mission in Africa.\nDuring the last 12 years of peace, our country has\nbenefited from considerable support from the United\nNations and its various specialized bodies for\nreconstruction and development activities. That\nsupport has been critical for economic growth and the\ngradual improvement of the people\u00eds living conditions.\n6\n\nIn 2000, unprecedented floods devastated\nMozambique. Those floods affected the central and\nsouthern parts of the country, causing heavy losses of\nhuman lives and infrastructure. Again, the response of\nthe United Nations and the international community to\nthe disaster was commendable. We take this\nopportunity to reiterate our gratitude to both the United\nNations and the international community in general for\ntheir unconditional support, without which the losses\ncould have been heavier.\nAs a result of sound economic and social policies\nand an enabling political environment, we have been\nable to record encouraging progress. The absolute\npoverty rate decreased from 69.5 per cent in 1997 to\n54.1 per cent in 2003. From 1997 to 2003, real average\ngross domestic product growth was 8 per cent.\nWe wish to recognize the critical role played by\nour development partners in assisting our country as it\nembarked on its steady progress. Their continued\nassistance will be critical to ensuring the sustainability\nand the irreversibility of the political, economic and\nsocial gains made so far.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic in Mozambique is a\ngrowing threat to sustainable development. Together\nwith malaria, tuberculosis and cholera, it is\njeopardizing decades of economic and social\ndevelopment. Without an aggressive response by the\nyear 2020, 20 per cent of the agricultural labour force\nin Mozambique will be lost to HIV/AIDS, and it is\nestimated that life expectancy will drop to 36 years by\n2010.\nWithin the framework of the African Union and\nits programmatic vision, the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u00eds Development (NEPAD), Africa has been\nmaking important strides towards its renaissance and\nthe ownership of its destiny. In that endeavour, we have\nwitnessed a further strengthening of democracy on the\ncontinent. Moreover, Africa has been increasingly\ndischarging its responsibility with regard to the\nmaintenance of peace and stability on the continent.\nToday we are building self-confidence around\nAfrica and creating the necessary conditions for\nsustainable development. Through NEPAD we are\nraising the ownership spirit surrounding African\nleaders to bring about significant changes in Africa\u00eds\ndevelopment. The recognition that success can only be\nachieved through partnership among all stakeholders is\na step forward in the establishment of public-private\npartnerships, regional integration and cooperation\namong different regions in Africa.\nWe would like to commend the decision of the\nSecretary-General to appoint an advisory panel on\ninternational support for NEPAD.\nDuring the last few years, we have witnessed\nglobal action towards the materialization of the\nMillennium Development Goals around the world. In\nthat endeavour, we have registered mixed results with\nencouraging developments on one side and visible\nsetbacks on the other.\nWe have seen a strong determination by\ndeveloping countries to achieve the Goals through\nrelevant domestic actions and policies. However,\ndespite such a clear commitment to improvement of the\nliving conditions of our respective peoples, our goals\nmay not be realized, due mainly to an unfavourable\ninternational environment, including insufficient flows\nof official development assistance and foreign direct\ninvestment.\nConsequently, we are failing in the creation of the\nnecessary conditions for the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals. We will not be able to\nachieve the 3 per cent economic growth worldwide that\nis required for reducing poverty by half by 2015, while\nsub-Saharan Africa records a disappointing level of\neconomic growth.\nThe flow of financial resources for the most\nneeded regions is decreasing. Market access remains a\nchallenge for both developing and developed countries.\nPandemic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, are\naggressively eroding the productive capacity of\ndeveloping countries.\nWe therefore need concerted global action to\neffectively address those challenges. The meeting of\nworld leaders for action against hunger and poverty\nheld at the United Nations yesterday was an\nencouraging renewal of the commitment of the\ninternational community to make the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals a reality. The final declaration that\nwas adopted should be the guide to our collective\naction against hunger and poverty.\nThe success of the ongoing reforms should be\nmeasured against an effective improvement of global\ngovernance and the strengthening of multilateralism,\nwith the General Assembly assuming a central role in\nthe conduct of global issues. The United Nations\n7\n\nshould pursue a multilateral approach that truly reflects\nthe current realities of the world, rather than entrench\nan anachronism inherited from the end of the Second\nWorld War.\nI urge you to continue the process of reform of\nour Organization, in order to have a Security Council\nthat is democratic, representative, equitable and\ntransparent. I urge you to continue with the agenda for\neconomic and social development.\nI feel honoured for having shared experiences\nwith Your Excellencies. I will keep and cherish\nmemories of the long and difficult, but gratifying\nmoments that we have spent together, building\nconsensus around vital issues for our Organization and,\nindeed, for our world. They were precious moments of\nlearning and of individual and collective enrichment.\nI express my profound gratitude to the United\nNations family for all the support they have given to\nme and to my country. I plead for the continuation of\nthat solidarity to Mozambique, with the aim of\neradicating poverty, hunger and endemic diseases.\nI leave you with a sense of having fulfilled my\nduty and given my humble contribution to the cause of\nliberation, peace and development of Mozambique,\nAfrica and the world as a whole.\nThe goal of complete decolonization has not yet\nbeen fulfilled, as the fate of 16 Non-Self-Governing\nTerritories has yet to be determined. We continue to\nlook for the day when the agenda of the General\nAssembly will contemplate neither colonies nor Non-\nSelf-Governing Territories.\nI look forward to a successful fifty-ninth session,\none in which we will focus on the priority actions for\nthe present year and for the years ahead. Whatever we\ndo, we must be able to give real hope to our nations\nand peoples \u00f3 hope not just to live, but also to live\nwell and safely; hope not only to continue to be free,\nbut to be free in decency and dignity."

        "file_text": "Let me start by congratulating\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\nninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is\na tribute not only to yourself, but also to your country,\nGabon, with which Botswana enjoys the most cordial\nof relations. 1 assure you of the full support and\ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your\nonerous duties and responsibilities.\nWe also pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia, for his stewardship of\nthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Saint\nLucia is another country with which Botswana enjoys\nexcellent relations. Come to think of it, we can\nunderstand why countries of the world can be friendly\nwith each other, as Botswana is friendly to them all.\nOur words of congratulations are addressed also\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nvisionary leadership of the Organization and for his\nenduring spirit in the face of the complex challenges\nthat the United Nations is called upon to address across\nour common universe.\nI take this opportunity to join other delegations in\nextending our condolences to the Government and the\npeople of the Russian Federation on the tragic loss of\nlife in Beslan. There can never be any justification for\nsuch a savage attack on innocent children, men and\nwomen. Botswana joins the rest of the international\ncommunity in condemning that horrendous act.\nWe also extend our sympathies and condolences\nto our dear brothers and sisters in the Caribbean and\nthe southern part of the United States of America on\nthe loss of life and the destruction of property caused\nby recent hurricanes.\nWe are gathered here today, 12 months before the\nfirst review of the Millennium Declaration, an\nunprecedented compact made by world leaders to unite\nin action in addressing the problems bedevilling\nhumanity. It is our hope that we will use this gathering\nto reflect on whether we have done enough to achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We have to ask\nourselves, individually and collectively, whether the\nenthusiasm and political commitment with which we\nendorsed the Declaration is being translated into\nprogrammes and projects. Simply put, we must be\nready to answer, hopefully in the affirmative, whether\nwe are doing enough to meet the targets that we set for\nourselves for the first five years of this millennium.\nLet us recall that pessimists proclaimed the\nMillennium Summit a talking shop and poured scorn\non its intended outcome. Are we doing enough to prove\nthem wrong? We owe it to the millions of our people\nwho look up to us to mitigate their suffering. Thus far,\nthe available evidence suggests that our performance\nhas been disappointing. Unfortunately, time is not on\nour side. There is need to act with vigour if we are to\nmeet our commitments.\nMy delegation is fully aware that a multiplicity of\nfactors combined to constrain and to thwart some of\nour efforts in the past few years. There is no doubt, for\ninstance, that major international conflicts, such as the\nwar in Iraq, have been a drag on the international\ncommunity\u2019s efforts to focus on the Goals. As a result\nof the war, oil prices have skyrocketed, putting\ntremendous pressure on the world economy, and in\nparticular on the vulnerable economies of developing\ncountries.\nIn spite of those challenges, we have abiding\nfaith in the human spirit, and therefore remain\nconvinced that it is not beyond the capacity of the\ninternational community to implement those ideals.\nThe Millennium Declaration recognized that\npoverty eradication is fundamental to achieving\nsustainable development, but many of our people still\nlive in conditions of abject poverty. The alleviation of\npoverty and its eventual eradication therefore remain a\ntop priority for us. Official development assistance\nlevels continue to fall in real terms to below the agreed\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. I must,\nhowever, commend the few countries that have met\nthat target. They have demonstrated that the target is\nrealistic and achievable.\nThe continuing debt burden is contributing\nsignificantly to the failure to deal effectively with the\nproblem of poverty. Most developing countries have\nundertaken courageous measures to implement painful\nstructural reforms. The commendable steps taken to\nintroduce sound macroeconomic management and\nprinciples of good governance deserve an urgent,\npositive and appropriate response. It must be\nacknowledged that some of the reforms can, in the short\nterm, worsen the plight of the poor for a very long time\nbefore the benefits of the sacrifices are realized.\n8\n\nStructural reforms have not been confined to\nbudgetary matters alone. They cover the whole\neconomic spectrum, including the creation of an\nenvironment conducive to the growth of the private\nsector and development, as well as to the flow of\nforeign direct investment. A number of developing\ncountries have promulgated legislative and regulatory\nframeworks to stimulate greater private sector\nparticipation in their economies. It is only natural,\ngiven the scope of the reform measures, that\ndeveloping countries should expect some positive\nreaction in the form of flows of foreign direct\ninvestments, which at the moment are, regrettably, still\nvery low.\nIn the area of trade, we are concerned about the\nslow progress in multilateral trade negotiations. As\ndeveloping countries, we have more to gain from a\nmore just, fairer and rule-based international trading\nsystem that would facilitate the integration of our\neconomies into the global economy. We urge the major\nplayers in those negotiations to show a greater sense of\nurgency and commitment.\nWe are concerned at the fact that, in spite of the\nstrong commitments expressed at the Millennium\nSummit, almost half of the people in sub-Saharan\nAfrica continue to survive on a dollar a day. That\nreflects no change in the statistics of 1990. One\nhundred twenty-one million children are still out of\nschool; and the under-5 mortality rate is still as high as\n174 per 1,000 live births.\nThe resources provided to fight the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic remain inadequate, yet we all agree that\nHIV/AIDS is one of the greatest challenges of our\ntime. Combating the scourge of HIV/AIDS must\ntherefore remain a high priority for action, because the\nepidemic has a debilitating impact on everything that\nwe do to improve the human condition. In 2003, it was\nreported that about 40 million people around the world\nwere living with the virus, and that well over 26\nmillion of them were in sub-Saharan Africa alone. The\nepidemic has killed over 2.3 million people in sub-\nSaharan Africa, out of a total of 3 million people who\ndied of AIDS-related illnesses around the world.\nIn Botswana, our various intervention programmes\nare beginning to bear fruit. We are indebted to our\nfriends internationally, whose partnership, support,\nassistance and, indeed, solidarity have combined to\nsave lives and give hope to many of our people.\nHowever, a lot still needs to be done. Our immediate\nchallenge is the lack of capacity to provide the\nantiretroviral therapy programme to all who need\nassistance. We shall therefore continue to rely on the\ninternational community for consistent and assured\nsupport, if we are to assist our people in time.\nInternational peace and security are under\nconstant threat. Our collective memory appears to be\nfailing to draw appropriate lessons, even from the\nrecent horrors of conflicts in Rwanda, Afghanistan and\nthe Balkans. Millions of people continue to suffer and\ndie needlessly in Africa and elsewhere because of\nunnecessary conflicts. It is once again Africa that has\nhad to bear the brunt of those conflicts.\nWe are concerned by the protracted conflicts in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Burundi\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. As Africans, we accept our\nresponsibility to find solutions to those conflicts. That\nis why we established the Peace and Security Council\nof the African Union in May of this year. In its short\nhistory, the Council has already deployed peacekeepers\nin Burundi and peace monitors in the Darfur region of\nSudan, and has sent mediators and peace envoys to\nhelp in negotiating solutions to conflicts elsewhere on\nthe continent.\nOne thing is clear: Africa is an integral part of the\ninternational community. The problems of Africa are\nglobal problems. We cannot isolate ourselves, nor be\nisolated from the rest of the world, and be expected to\nsingle-handedly find solutions to such conflicts. We\nneed consistent and continued international support. In\nthat regard, we acknowledge the important and\ncommendable role that the United Nations is playing in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nand Burundi.\nThe peace process in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo is at a critical stage. The international\ncommunity has a duty and a responsibility to assist the\nGovernment and people of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo in the search for national reconciliation and\na lasting political settlement to the problems facing\nthat country. It is our hope that the international\ncommunity will provide the necessary financial and\nmaterial support to ensure the success of the\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region,\nwhich is to be held in Arusha, United Republic of\nTanzania, at the end of this year.\n9\n\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, everything possible must be\ndone to maintain peace and stability, as well as to\npromote national reconciliation, by ensuring that the\nparties accept the Government of National\nReconciliation.\nRegarding the situation in the Darfur region of\nSudan, the international community must take urgent\nmeasures to arrest the deteriorating security and\nhumanitarian situation in that country. The people of\nDarfur should be assisted to return to their homes in\nsafety and dignity. We urge the Government of Sudan\nto be receptive to the proposals contained in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report and, above all, take due\ncognizance of Security Council resolution 1564 (2004),\nand in particular to facilitate the speedy delivery by the\ninternational community of much-needed humanitarian\nassistance.\nWe are troubled by the escalating conflict in the\nMiddle East, which is a serious threat to international\npeace and security. How long can humanity stand the\nsight of human suffering that we see daily on our\ntelevision screens? For how long can generations of\nmothers mourn the loss of their sons in combat? For\nhow long should succeeding generations fight wars that\ntheir forebears fought? We ask those involved in those\nconflicts, descendants of old civilizations that made\nenormous contributions to the growth and development\nof modern civilization, to live and let live and to find\nin themselves the courage to resolve their differences\nthrough dialogue rather than through indiscriminate\nviolence.\nTerrorism is one of the greatest challenges to\ninternational peace and security. No one country can\ndefeat that scourge, which has caused the loss of many\nlives across the world. The activities of terrorists have\nbecome very complex and sophisticated. We need\nunited, stronger and concerted action by all the\ncountries of the world to defeat that scourge, which\nknows no boundaries.\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm the importance that\nBotswana attaches to the revitalization of the General\nAssembly and the reform of the Security Council. We\ncommend the President of the fifty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly for his practical proposals in\nthat area. We were disappointed that the Assembly\ncould not reach consensus on those proposals. My\ndelegation will contribute in whatever small way it can\nto the building of such consensus.\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council, we\nare concerned that, after 11 years of consultations, not\nmuch progress has been achieved. The solution to that\nvexing question rests on the ability of Member States,\nin particular the permanent members of the Council, to\nmuster the political will to compromise. We should not\ntolerate this paralysis any longer. It is therefore my\nhope that action will be taken at this session to\ncontinue the process of democratizing the Security\nCouncil and make it more representative of the\nmembership of the United Nations.\nFinally, I once again make a special appeal to the\ngeneral Membership of the Organization to do more to\nfacilitate the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration. We must do all we can to transform hope\ninto reality. Together we have the resources, the skills\nand the science and technology to make the\nDeclaration have meaning in the lives of our peoples.\nBotswana is committed to doing its part."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and the\npeople of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I\nextend congratulations to Mr. Ping on his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session. We are confident that his experience and\ndiplomatic skills will enable him to discharge fully the\nweighty responsibilities of his office.\nPermit me to convey to his predecessor, The\nHonourable Julian Hunte, Minister of Foreign Affairs\nof Saint Lucia, our deep appreciation of his efforts\ntowards revitalization of the General Assembly.\nI wish also to convey to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, the full support of the Government\nand the people of Trinidad and Tobago as he continues\nthe global initiatives of the United Nations towards\nmaking the world better and safer for all humanity.\nToday Trinidad and Tobago is celebrating its\ntwenty-eighth anniversary as a republic. Over our 42\nyears as an independent country, we have made\nsignificant strides in the development of our nation. We\nhave maintained a strong tradition of democratic\n7\n\ngovernance through an increasingly inclusive and\nmultiparty political system; by respecting fully the\nconstitutionally entrenched and internationally\nrecognized fundamental human rights and freedoms of\nthe individual; and by ensuring strict adherence to the\nrule of law.\nWe have sought increasingly to diversify our\neconomic base. Through consistent and sound macro-\neconomic policies, together with prudent management\nand use of our resources, we have sustained more than\na decade of positive economic growth, which last year\nwas of the order of 13.2 per cent.\nOur country has made significant strides in\nadvancing the capabilities of our people through\nuniversal access to primary and secondary education.\nWe have gone further through our State-sponsored\npreschool programme, which targets universal early\nchildhood education by 2010, and by fully opening the\ngateway to tertiary education through support for every\nstudent, enhanced funding for deserving ones, and our\nrecently established University of Trinidad and\nTobago.\nOur archipelagic Republic, populated by 1.3\nmillion people of African, Indian, European, Chinese,\nMiddle Eastern and mixed ancestries, constitutes a\nveritable microcosm of the people of the world.\nHowever, we have been able to foster racial harmony\nand religious tolerance through the collective embrace\nof the diversity of our people.\nThat approach, together with adherence to\nintegrity and transparency in public affairs and equality\nof opportunity for all, has been essential to the\ncontinued peace, stability and progress we enjoy as we\npropose to make Trinidad and Tobago a beacon of\nintegrity in the world.\nTrinidad and Tobago has demonstrated\nremarkable strength and resilience in the face of a\nglobal environment characterized by rapid economic,\nsocial and other changes; this has mobilized us to\nembark on the realization of a bold new vision in the\npursuit of our developmental agenda. In that respect,\nour Government and people are currently engaged in a\nhighly participatory consultative process aimed at\nformulating a National Strategic Development Plan to\nguide Trinidad and Tobago towards becoming a\ndeveloped nation by the year 2020 or earlier.\nIt is called Vision 2020, and its agenda includes\nhuman capital development; the evolution of a\ntechnologically driven, knowledge-based society; the\ndevelopment of a highly productive and globally\ncompetitive economy; and, by the year 2020, the\nprovision for all our citizens of a standard of living\ncomparable to that enjoyed in developed countries.\nOur achievements stand in indisputable testimony\nto what a small, independent nation such as ours can do\nin that regard. There is an instructive link between two\nof the features that today define and distinguish our\ncountry among others in the region. One is our oil and\nnatural gas resources \u2014 the foundation and mainstay\nof our economy; the other, the steelpan, our creation\nderived from heating and tuning the top of discarded\noil drums.\nThe steelpan is one of the most important musical\ninstruments invented during the last century. We are\nproud to have created it, and equally so of its growing\ninternational recognition and popularity, which is an\napt reflection of the phenomenal ingenuity of the\npeoples of developing countries.\nThe same holds true in respect of achievements in\nour energy sector. At just over 130,000 barrels of oil\nper day, Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s production is not\nsignificant by international standards. Our natural gas\nproduction, however, stands at 2.9 billion cubic feet\nper day, and that has propelled my country to become\ntoday the world\u2019s largest exporter of methanol and also\nof ammonia. We are currently supplying 80 per cent of\nUnited States liquid natural gas imports out of our\nthree trains, and we propose to leverage that fact\ntowards Caribbean regional development. We are also a\ncritical supplier of energy to our Caribbean neighbours.\nTo further facilitate this, we are exploring the\nfeasibility of several energy-related projects, including\nthe establishment of a natural gas pipeline through the\neastern Caribbean. We have also entered into a joint\nventure with neighbouring Venezuela to liquefy that\ncountry\u2019s natural gas in Trinidad and Tobago.\nMeanwhile, our iron and steel production\nfacilities are being expanded. Several new production\nfacilities are in train, among them an ethylene\nproduction complex, an aluminium smelter project, and\nothers for expanded ammonia and methanol production\nas well as other downstream petrochemical products.\nThe combination of an attractive and enabling\ninvestment climate, available and affordable energy, a\n8\n\nstrategic location vis-\u00e0-vis the North, Central and\nSouth American and European markets, a population\nliteracy level of over 90 per cent, and a sound work\nethic, as well as a good communications infrastructure,\ncontinue to make Trinidad and Tobago one of the\nlargest per-capita recipients of foreign direct\ninvestment in the hemisphere. Indeed, last year we\nwere the second-largest recipient after Canada.\nLike other countries we, too, have our fair share\nof challenges. For example, our strategic location \u2014\nless than nine miles off the South American coast and\nto the south of the Caribbean island chain, with\nexcellent air and sea transport links to major North\nAtlantic cities \u2014 renders Trinidad and Tobago highly\nvulnerable to trade in illegal drugs and firearms.\nCombating narco-trafficking, drug-related crimes and\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS is among our greatest\nchallenges, but the Government of Trinidad and\nTobago remains resolute in its determination to\neradicate those scourges. We continue to implement the\nmeasures necessary to fight them and are confident that\nwe shall win the battle.\nOur development agenda is not centred solely on\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is part and\nparcel of a pan-Caribbean agenda to which we are\nirrevocably and solidly committed, and which takes\ninto consideration the fullest development of the\ncountries of our region. Many historical and other ties\nbind our Caribbean nations and we understand that the\nfundamental basis for our development lies in being\nable to work more closely together to exert a greater\ninfluence on our own as well as global development,\nwhich for centuries have been dictated by others.\nToday, our level of functional cooperation in the\nregion has increased over a range of areas and Trinidad\nand Tobago continues to play a central role at all\nlevels. We therefore look forward to the\noperationalization of our newest Caribbean institution,\nthe Caribbean Court of Justice, which will serve as the\narbitral body for the soon-to-be-established CARICOM\nSingle Market and Economy, as well as the region\u2019s\nfinal appellate Court, and will be headquartered in Port\nof Spain.\nThe development of Trinidad and Tobago and\nCARICOM are intertwined. CARICOM is our second\nlargest export market after the United States of\nAmerica, absorbing close to 20 per cent of our exports.\nOur share of regional trade grew to 80 per cent in\n2001. Since 1996, we have contributed approximately\nUS$ 1.4 billion in assistance to Caribbean States\nthrough a variety of mechanisms including capital\nmarket activities, foreign direct investment, debt relief,\nand direct assistance. Last year we provided US$ 505\nmillion in loans to companies and Governments in the\nregion, some of whom have difficulty in borrowing on\nthe international market. In addition, we have recently\nestablished a new grant facility, to be based on sales of\npetroleum products to the region, which will be\ndedicated to poverty eradication within CARICOM.\nMy country sees the development of the\nCaribbean, our second largest market, as integral to the\ndevelopment of Trinidad and Tobago. Even so, our\nnational and regional development efforts require an\ninternational economic environment of greater\nsensitivity, one facilitating a more beneficial\nintegration of developing countries into the world\neconomy. In that regard, as sanguine as we are about\nthe future of Trinidad and Tobago, I must on this\noccasion take a stand in the interest of the beleaguered\nnations of the Caribbean. How often have small\nindependent States preached from this very\nmountaintop of the need for multilateral trading\narrangements that take into account the inherent\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States, and\nconsequently the need to be accorded special and\ndifferential treatment? There is a notable reluctance of\nsome partner countries to respond accordingly, and that\ncontinues to have negative consequences, especially\nfor the small economies of the Caribbean.\nTrinidad and Tobago therefore stands resolute\nwith our developing country partners in calling for\nwhat must be conceived of as the application of a\nsocial conscience within the management of\nglobalization and its processes. As capital importing\neconomies, the developing countries of the Caribbean\nare only too well aware, sometimes painfully so, of the\nimplications of capital shortage for the generation of\nemployment and the provision of housing, education\nand health care for our citizens. And perhaps I speak\neven for those yet unborn.\nIt is through softer trading arrangements,\nincreased financial flows and the consequent\nempowerment of our citizens that we will be able to\nrealize the most central of all the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, the eradication of poverty. The\nimplications are clear. The course on which some of\nour European Union (EU) country partners are\n9\n\nembarked will render the achievement of our\nMillennium Development Goals more difficult.\nIn speaking of those goals our attention is now\ndrawn to Haiti, our newest CARICOM member, where\nover 1,000 people died from the onslaught of\nHurricane Jeanne, further aggravating the tremendous\nproblems that that nation already suffers. Trinidad and\nTobago therefore welcomes the decision taken by the\nSecurity Council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30\nApril 2004 to establish the United Nations Stabilization\nMission in Haiti. We also support the recent decision\nby the Economic and Social Council to reactivate its\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to promote the\ncoordination and development of a long-term\nprogramme of assistance to that country. We believe\nthat those efforts by the international community will\ncontribute significantly to the stability and urgently\nneeded development of Haiti.\nAt this juncture, however, Haiti needs a\ntremendous outpouring of international humanitarian\nassistance. The same holds true for Grenada and\nseveral other Caribbean States whose misfortune it was\nto have been visited by \u201cIvan, the Terrible\u201d. On\n8 September, Hurricane Ivan descended on Grenada. In\nless than two hours it had completely destroyed the\neconomy and infrastructure of Grenada, ravaging that\ncountry beyond description. Ninety percent of the\nbuildings on the island were damaged or destroyed. A\nprimarily agricultural economy, dependent also on\ntourism, all of Grenada\u2019s crops disappeared with the\nstrong wind. CARICOM leaders were recently advised\nby a Grenadian representative that today Grenada has\nno gross domestic product.\nBefore visiting Grenada, Hurricane Ivan \u2014\nsowing varying amounts of disruption and\ndestruction \u2014 visited Tobago and Barbados. After\nGrenada, it proceeded to Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Cuba,\nBahamas and the southern United States. Everywhere\nthere was considerable damage, but Grenada and the\nCayman Islands were the hardest hit.\nBefore Ivan, there was Charley and Frances.\nAfter Ivan came Jeanne, with death and destruction for\nPuerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A\nnumber of CARICOM countries are now saddled with\nthe immense challenge of trying to restore normalcy.\nPermit me to ask, to what extent have these\nobvious climate changes been influenced by incursions\ninto space from planet Earth, or for that matter by\necological imbalances caused by industrialization?\nIn the aftermath of the devastation visited on\nGrenada, CARICOM countries have been rallying to\nthe assistance of that island, and must be applauded for\ntheir massive outpouring of humanitarian aid that\ncontinues to flow to Grenada. In that regard, permit me\nto recognize and applaud the most appropriate response\nof the Secretary-General.\nTrinidad and Tobago pledges its support to our\nbeleaguered Caribbean neighbours, and we have thus\ncommitted ourselves through direct financial and other\nassistance. But what Grenada and Haiti require is well\nbeyond the region\u2019s capacity to deliver. I urge the\nwider international community and donor agencies to\nrespond adequately and to play their part. Help is\nneeded and needed now.\nThe catastrophic events of the present hurricane\nseason bring into sharper focus yet another dimension\nof the vulnerability of Caribbean countries. The\nJanuary 2005 International Meeting in Mauritius to\nreview the implementation of the Barbados Programme\nof Action must seek to comprehensively address the\nnew and emerging threats to the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing States. The\ninternational community should take note that a whole\nnew set of security issues have now arisen in the\nCaribbean as a result of those developments.\nThe answer to so many of our problems lies in\nmultilateralism, if approached the right way. Belief in\nand respect for multilateralism led to Trinidad and\nTobago\u2019s respect for all major global and regional\nforums. Today, we are active participants in the\ncreation of the free trade area of the Americas, which,\nwhen realized, will stretch from Alaska in the north to\nTierra del Fuego in the south, creating a market of\nmore than 800 million consumers and generating\ntremendous opportunity for economic and social\ndevelopment.\nOur region\u2019s commitment to that hemispheric\nintegration process has led Trinidad and Tobago and its\npartners in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to\npropose our capital city, Port-of-Spain, as the ideal\nlocation for the seat of the proposed permanent\nsecretariat of the free trade area of the Americas.\nUnanimous regional support for this CARICOM\nproposal would demonstrate the hemisphere\u2019s\n10\n\nsolidarity with one of its smaller members and give\ntrue meaning to the principle of the sovereign equality\nof all States. It would further decentralize the\nheadquartering of major international and regional\norganizations and enable a small island developing\nState to place its resources at the service of the\nhemispheric community. Accordingly, we look forward\nto receiving the support of all our neighbours in the\nhemisphere.\nWe remain pleased with the progress of certain\nmultilateral initiatives, including the New African\nPartnership for Development, which I urge CARICOM\nand African countries to support by exploring\nopportunities to develop investment, trade, tourism and\nregular transport routes between our region and the\nAfrican continent.\nWe also consider the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court to be a major\nachievement, and we urge partner countries to uphold\nthe integrity of the Rome Statute. The commission of\nwar crimes, genocide and other such crimes against\nhumanity has been facilitated by a global culture of\nimpunity. The people of the world will be safe only\nwhen the perpetrators of such crimes know that\npunishment is inescapable.\nTrinidad and Tobago condemns all forms and\nmanifestations of terrorism, wherever and by\nwhomever they are committed. We are already a party\nto the principal international legal instruments against\nterrorism, and the Government will shortly take\nparliamentary action to enact legislation honouring our\nobligations with respect to the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism.\nAs the international community continues to\nconfront the many threats to the survival of mankind,\nthe world\u2019s political leadership must unequivocally\nreaffirm its commitment to the United Nations so that\nthe United Nations can continue its role in fighting\ninjustice, inequality, inequity and intolerance\nworldwide through resolute and speedy action, in\nrespect of its commitment to the ideals for which it was\nfounded.\nTrinidad and Tobago is of the view that the issue\nof United Nations reform takes on even more urgency\nas the institution approaches the sixtieth anniversary of\nits founding in 1945. We therefore look forward to\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General\u2019s recommendations\nbased on the report of the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, chaired by former Prime\nMinister Anand Panyarachun.\nIn conclusion, I wish to propose that on 24\nOctober, 2005, United Nations Day, a special\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly be\nheld in San Francisco, where our Charter was signed,\nto reaffirm our commitment to the lofty ideals\nenunciated some 50 years ago, which are still valid\ntoday."

        "file_text": "Let me first\ncongratulate Mr. Jean Ping on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and\nwish him every success in this important position. I\nwould also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Julian\nHunte, for his relentless efforts and leadership\nthroughout the year.\nIn May, the Czech Republic became a member of\nthe European Union (EU). For the first time, we took\npart in the preparation of the EU statement presented\nhere last week by the Foreign Minister of the\nNetherlands, as well as in shaping the EU priorities for\nthe current General Assembly session. It goes without\nsaying that we fully associate ourselves with those\ntexts.\nWe share the commitment of the EU to effective\nmultilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.\nIndeed, the vision of a strong and truly universal\nUnited Nations is one of the fundamentals of Czech\nforeign policy.\nSecurity, or the lack of it, has emerged as the\nmost challenging problem today. International\nterrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, regional conflicts, State failure or\norganized crime \u2014 these are the threats menacing all\nof us.\nTerrorism spares no one anywhere in the world.\nThe brutality of the attacks and the increase in their\nnumber over the past year are frightening. It seems that\nthe whole nature of terrorism is changing. While most\nearlier terrorists tried to target specific persons or\ninstitutions, with the aim of gaining the sympathy of\nthe general public, today\u2019s terrorists are solely intent\non spreading fear and terror. Their target is the general\npublic, each one of us, and the more killed the better.\nWhat can we expect of individuals who sacrifice\nunlimited numbers of their own people to a perverse\nideology? Their acquisition of weapons of mass\ndestruction would result in a deadly combination.\nAbsolute disregard for life by these \u201cnew\u201d\nterrorists has also given rise to their most dangerous\ntool, the ideological suicide bomber. Previously,\nterrorists had to devote most of their energy to\nplanning escape routes and concealing themselves; a\nsuicide bomber, on the other hand, needs only to\nconcentrate on how best to hit and to destroy his target.\nThe diffusion of targets and the perpetrators\u2019\nabsolute resolve mean that terrorist threats have\ncompletely permeated our public and private spaces,\neach area of which has become a defence site. All this\ncould ultimately lead to very disagreeable restrictions\non certain freedoms and rights. And this takes us full\ncircle.\nIf we are lax in understanding our roots and\nvalues, and if we do not have a comprehensive grasp of\nhuman rights, we could find that, in the end, we are\nunable to cope with the uneasy balance between\nsecurity and freedom.\nI do not want to speculate about cause and effect.\nIt is not the case that a terrorist attack is a reaction, an\ninappropriate reaction, to something. Terrorists\u2019\nideology is aggressive and expansive, and they do not\nrecognize terms such as \u201cconciliation\u201d or\n\u201ccoexistence\u201d. Therefore, each offer we make to\nnegotiate, each sign of unwillingness to defend\nourselves, is seen by them as further proof of our\nweakness and, by extension, of their \u201cright\u201d to assume\ncontrol of declining society.\nIn the fight against terrorism, nobody can remain\nneutral. The United Nations has to pave the way for\nthis fight at the global level. To be sure, the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee has done an outstanding job in\noverseeing the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) and in facilitating universal\nacceptance of the United Nations Conventions on\nterrorism; but certainly more can and should be done.\nThe true tests of our ability to cooperate are Iraq,\nAfghanistan and the Middle East.\nIraq continues to be of utmost concern to the\ninternational community. The full transfer of power to\nthe Iraqi Interim Government is a historic moment for\nthe country and an essential step on the road towards a\nfree, prosperous and secure country. The road will, no\ndoubt, be long and winding. Without the elimination of\nterrorist activities and the stabilization of the security\nsituation, political transition and economic recovery\nwill remain elusive.\n5\n\nLast summer, United Nations employees in Iraq\npaid the highest price for their commitment to help\nthose in need. Now, the Organization has new tasks\nbefore it, including those connected with preparations\nfor free elections in January 2005. However, a greater\nengagement of the United Nations requires a more\nsecure environment and stronger support from the\ninternational community. The Czech Republic\u2019s\ncontribution is focused mainly on building up Iraqi\nsecurity forces and helping to finance the protection of\nthe United Nations presence in Iraq.\nIraq, however, must not divert our attention from\nother major security concerns, including Afghanistan,\nthe Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. In all these\nconflicts, my country seeks to play a constructive role,\ncontributing in various ways to the related efforts of\nthe international community. Thus, in Afghanistan, the\nCzech Republic is participating in the stabilization\nprocess and the rooting out of terrorism; in Africa, it is\ntaking part in peacekeeping operations; in Kosovo, we\nhave our largest military contingent abroad serving in\nthe Kosovo Force and we intend to contribute troops to\nthe new EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAs for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we believe\nthat the role of the international community lies in\nproviding a trusted frame of reference. It is crucial that\nboth parties to the conflict make a sincere effort to\nimplement their obligations in order to achieve the\nvision of two States living side by side in peace and\nsecurity and in a peaceful and secure neighbourhood.\nLast but not least, Africa has to remain on our\nagenda. Ten years after the genocide in Rwanda,\nanother part of Africa is suffering from grave ethnic\nviolence. In Darfur, people are dying every day, and in\nthe Great Lakes region the situation is not much better.\nThe international community must not turn away from\nthose tragedies.\nSo far I have focused mainly on what we call\nhard threats to international security. But I do not want\nto create an impression that other problems plaguing\nthe contemporary world are of lesser importance.\nThose more traditional problems, or soft threats, also\ncontinue to deserve our undiminished attention. There\nis no question of these two threats competing for our\nresponse; there is no question of forgetting one in\nfavour of the other.\nThat is why the Czech Republic, as an emerging\ndonor country, supports the strengthening of\nmultilateral development assistance within the United\nNations system, as well as close cooperation among the\nUnited Nations funds and programmes and the Bretton\nWoods institutions. That is why we support and strive\nto contribute to activities undertaken in pursuit of the\nMillennium Development Goals and other\ninternationally agreed development targets.\nRespect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms remains a priority of Czech foreign policy.\nTogether with the rest of the EU, we place special\nemphasis on the abolition of the death penalty, the fight\nagainst torture \u2014 in fact, just a few days ago we signed\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention against\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment \u2014 the protection of children\nin armed conflicts and, of course, respect for the\nactivities of human rights defenders who,\nunfortunately, continue to face difficult conditions in a\nnumber of countries, such as Belarus, Myanmar and\nCuba, among others.\nConvinced that all people have equal rights and\ndignity, the Czech Republic is concerned about recent\nattempts to create a human being through cloning. We\ntherefore concur with those calling for the swift\nadoption of a legally binding instrument at the\nuniversal level regulating the cloning of human beings.\nFaced with the aforementioned challenges, the\nUnited Nations has to change. Of course, United\nNations reform seems to be on everyone\u2019s agenda.\nThere are, perhaps, too many reform processes going\non in parallel or partially overlapping. To achieve\ngenuine reform, however, we simply have to keep the\npressure on; the United Nations must continue\nconstantly to monitor itself and to continue its pursuit\nof improvement.\nThe Czech Republic considers itself a reform-\nminded country. It is an advocate of revitalization of\nthe General Assembly, strengthening of the United\nNations and reform and enlargement of the Security\nCouncil. For many years, we have been actively\ninvolved in those processes, including through the\nCzech presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We have no vested interest in these\nreforms except the better functioning and greater\nauthority of the whole United Nations. The Czech\nRepublic will continue to support inevitable reform\nmeasures, including enlargement of the Security\nCouncil in both categories of membership. In\n6\n\nparticular, we support the aspiration of Germany and\nJapan to permanent seats, as well as the allocation of a\nfurther three new permanent seats for Africa, Asia and\nLatin America.\nWe greatly appreciate the reform efforts that the\nSecretary-General has made so far, and we expect his\nguidance to continue in the years to come. We eagerly\nawait the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change, which should place United\nNations reform in a wider context of major global\nthreats and challenges.\nWe are determined to play an active role in\nfinding multilateral and United Nations-based solutions\nto numerous grave problems of the contemporary\nworld. An expression of that commitment and\ndetermination is our candidature for a non-permanent\nseat on the Security Council in 2008-2009."

        "file_text": "I\nam pleased, Sir, to congratulate you and your friendly\ncountry, Gabon, on your well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. We remain convinced that your great skills and\nrich experience guarantee the success of our work. I\nwould also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Julian\nHunte, who so ably guided the work of the previous\nsession. I should like also to express my sincere\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and\nto his entire team, on the immense efforts they have\nexerted to achieve the noble ideals of our Organization.\nAllow me to express our deep satisfaction at the\nactivities undertaken since the last Assembly session,\nnotably the high-level segment of the Economic and\nSocial Council, held in New York in June, on the theme\nof \u201cResources mobilization and enabling environment\nfor poverty eradication in the context of the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010\u201d.\nMy country had the privilege of hosting the\npreparatory meeting for our subregion last April,\nbringing together government sectors and international\npartners, as well as regional civil society organizations.\nWe hail the efforts to define priorities and the\nmeasures needed to implement the recommendations of\nthe Monterrey Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, the decisions taken at the Johannesburg\nSummit on Sustainable Development and the\nMillennium Development Goals. I should note here\nthat those Goals will be reached only if the Group of\nEight and the other industrialized countries pursue\ntheir joint efforts to provide greater support and\nassistance to developing countries. In this regard, I\nwould also like to reaffirm my country\u2019s support for\nthe New York Declaration on the Action Against\nHunger and Poverty.\nThe achievement of the Development Goals and\nensuring security and stability are closely linked to\nhow we address the problem of violence and terrorism.\nTerrorism is a global problem, and its solution must\nalso be global. The fight must be based on an\nintellectual and cultural vision of the complementarity\nof civilizations and on an absolute rejection of\nconfrontation between countries.\nIt is important also to note the unjust disparity in\nthe level of development between rich and poor\ncountries, because poverty and social, scientific,\ntechnological underdevelopment are among the main\ncauses of tension, violence and extremism. The growth\nof terrorism, and its resulting fear and destruction,\nobliges the international community to engage in closer\ndialogue, increased coordination and a concerted effort\nto face the dangers that threaten all humankind.\nMy country, Mauritania, firmly condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including\nthe taking and killing of hostages, and we reaffirm our\ncommitment to combat that phenomenon, which is\nalien to our society and to our sacred Islamic values,\nwhich reject violence and extremism and which call for\ndialogue, understanding, tolerance and the acceptance\nof others.\nIt is clear that the repeated failure of the\ninternational community to fulfil its commitments with\nregard to the establishment of a comprehensive, just\nand lasting peace in the Middle East and the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State\nliving side by side with Israel, remains the main cause\nof insecurity and instability in the region and of the\ngrowth of the extremism and violence from which we\nall are suffering.\nThat is why it is high time that the international\ncommunity \u2014 represented by the Security Council, the\nGeneral Assembly and all relevant regional and\n9\n\ninternational actors, including the Quartet \u2014 work\ntogether to bring about peace and stability in the\nMiddle East, which, together with the rest of the world,\nhas suffered for so long from the destructive effects of\nwar.\nIt is high time that we implement the Arab peace\ninitiative, under which the Arab States guarantee\ncomprehensive peace and the promise of normal\nrelations to Israel in exchange for a complete\nwithdrawal from all Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese\nterritories up to the borders of 4 June 1967, the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, with\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, and a just, consensual\nresolution of the refugee issue. Clearly, there is no way\nto achieve that noble goal except to carry out the peace\nprocess and to resume the negotiations on all tracks, in\nkeeping with the Madrid terms of reference, the\nprinciple of land for peace, the road map and the\nrelevant provisions of international law.\nWe are following with interest the development\nof the situation in Iraq, and we reaffirm our\ncommitment to the unity, territorial integrity,\nsovereignty and independence of Iraq and to non-\ninterference in its internal affairs. My country also\nreaffirms its support for the brotherly Iraqi people, its\nInterim National Council and its Interim Government\nin their efforts to overcome the difficulties hampering\ntheir aspirations to security, stability and the\nestablishment of State institutions.\nWe are also following with interest the\ndevelopment of the situation in Darfur. We welcome\nthe commendable efforts of the Sudanese Government,\nin cooperation with the African Union, the League of\nArab States and the United Nations, with a view to\nresolving the humanitarian, security and political\naspects of the crisis. We call upon all regional and\ninternational actors to support those efforts and to\naccord to the Sudanese Government the time it needs\nto honour its commitments without threats of armed\nintervention, the imposition of sanctions or any\ntendentious propaganda aimed at giving the Darfur\nproblem an ethnic or sectarian dimension. In that\nregard, I welcome the positive results achieved\nfollowing the peace negotiations held at Abuja and\nN\u2019Djamena, sponsored by the African Union. I\nencourage all the parties to continue the dialogue and\nthe negotiation process, since that is the only way to\nresolve the crisis.\nI now turn to Western Sahara. Mauritania\nsupports the efforts undertaken by the United Nations\nand its Secretary-General to arrive at a definitive\nsettlement that brings stability to the region and enjoys\nthe agreement of all the parties.\nMy country is strongly committed to contributing\nto relations of cooperation and solidarity within the\nframework of our integrated regional affiliations. We\nare deeply convinced of the need for the Arab Maghreb\nUnion, which remains an indispensable strategic option\nand an ambitious project aimed at enabling the peoples\nof the region to achieve greater complementarity and\nsolidarity. My country seeks to deepen dialogue,\nunderstanding and cultural contacts among\ncivilizations through the five-plus-five approach and\nthe Barcelona approach.\nAt the level of the African continent, we\ncommend the solidarity and complementarity within\nthe framework of the organization on the use of the\nSenegal River and the brotherly and friendly bilateral\nrelations with West African countries. My country also\nwelcomes the decisions taken recently by the\ninstitutions and organs of the African Union,\nparticularly the formation of an African Parliament and\na Peace and Security Council, which will constitute a\nframework that will enable us to transcend all current\ndifficulties.\nAt the international level, Mauritania reaffirms its\nsupport for the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole\nand legal representative of the Chinese people. In that\nregard, we appreciate the efforts of the Chinese\nGovernment aimed at achieving its reunification by\npeaceful means.\nMy country has the honour to preside over the\ncurrent session of the League of Arab States at the\nlevel of Ministers for Foreign Affairs. I should like to\nstress that the Arab Summit reaffirmed at Tunis the\nresolve of all Arab States to pursue the reform process\nby deepening democracy, expanding political\nparticipation and promoting respect for human rights,\nthe advancement of women and the understanding that\nsuch reform must be progressive, gradual and adapted\nto social and cultural traditions specific to the States of\nthe region, not imposed from outside.\nMauritania is pursuing its efforts in that direction\nunder the leadership of the President of the Republic,\nHis Excellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid\u2019Ahmed Taya,\nand continues to work to establish the rule of law, good\n10\n\ngovernance and pluralistic democracy that promotes\nhuman rights, freedom of expression, and personal and\ngeneral freedoms.\nAt the socio-economic level, we have adopted\nsignificant new laws, such as those dealing with labour\nand trafficking in persons and the introduction of broad\nreforms that would enable us to make progress in\nmodernizing public administration to improve its\nperformance, liberalizing private enterprise, promoting\ninvestment and providing basic services for our\ncitizens, such as education, health and potable water.\nThe Charter of the United Nations reflects the\ncommon aspiration of the world\u2019s peoples to attain\ntheir fundamental development objectives and to\nensure international peace and security. Clearly, the\nsweeping changes now taking place in the international\narena call for the reform of United Nations structures\nwith a view to expanding representation on the\nSecurity Council, thereby opening it up to key regions,\nsuch as Africa and Latin America, as well as\nsignificant groups, such as the Group of Arab States,\nand important industrialized countries that provide\nsubstantial contributions to the Organization, such as\nGermany and Japan, in order to respond to the new\nchanges taking place and to enable the Council, thus\nrestructured, to better reflect the realities and diversity\nof today\u2019s world.\nWe sincerely hope to see the international\ncommunity work together to consolidate international\nsolidarity in order to establish a new, just and more\nequitable world order that safeguards peace and\nsecurity and provides a life of freedom and dignity for\neveryone."

        "file_text": "This is\nthe first occasion on which I have addressed the\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of my country; I am very\npleased to do so. My country is an old country - a\ndiverse country, with several languages and various\ntraditions and cultures. Our country is European,\nMediterranean and Ibero-American in character.\nI am speaking on behalf of a country that has had\nits share of difficult experiences throughout history. It\nis a country in which some people who are alive today\nhave known a civil war, a dictatorship that lasted for\nalmost four decades and a democracy that is now 25\nyears old and that has brought great progress. We have\nalso known the scourge of terrorism for more than 30\nyears \u00f3 terrorism that has taken so many lives.\nOver the past 30 years, Spanish men and women\nhave learned a great deal about terrorism. We learned\nearly on how evil it is. We became familiar with it. We\nlearned how to defy it and how to withstand its blows\nwith courage and dignity. We have learned how to fight\nit. Precisely because they have experienced it for 30\nyears that the citizens of my country felt deeply the\npain of the American people on 11 September 2001.\nWe knew how they felt; we know how they feel. Here\nin New York, I would like to convey the heartfelt\nsolidarity of the people of Spain with the great nation\nof the United States.\nWe fully understand the terrible pain that in\nrecent years has been inflicted upon Jakarta, Bali,\nCasablanca, Riyadh and Beslanq. We know all about\nkidnappings, bombings and cold-blooded killings. We\nknow what compassion means.\nOn 11 March this year, a terrorist attack in\nMadrid took the lives of 192 people. We had never\nexperienced that kind of terrorism before, but we were\nfamiliar with the bloodshed and the pain that it caused.\nI would like, from this rostrum, to express my deep\nappreciation to all nations for their solidarity with our\ncountry when we were suffering so deeply after the\nbrutal attack in Madrid.\nSpanish men and women were not afraid. On the\nday after the bombings, millions of people left their\nhomes and took to the streets and squares of our cities\nand towns. Once again, we expressed our\ncondemnation, disgust and total contempt for terrorist\nbrutality.\nThirty years of resisting terrorism has taught us\nthat the risk of a terrorist victory rises sharply when, in\norder to fight terror, democracy betrays its fundamental\nnature, when Governments curtail civil liberties, put\njudicial guaranties at risk or carry out pre-emptive\nmilitary operations. This is what my people have\nlearned: it is the rule of law, democracy and political\nmethods that make us stronger and make them weaker.\nWe will resist terrorism. Our history endorses our\nresolve. We will pursue our fight against terrorism, but\nwe will do so respecting domestic and international\nlaw; we will do so with respect for human rights and\nfor the United Nations \u00f3 and in no other way. It is not\nonly the ethics of our beliefs that move us. It is above\nall our belief in ethics. Our conviction is that\nlegality - only legality \u00f3 will enable us to prevail in\nthe fight against terrorism.\nNothing justifies terrorism. Like the plague, it has\nno justification. But like the plague, it has roots that\ncan and must be uncovered. We can and must rationally\nanalyse how it emerges and how it grows, so that we\ncan fight it rationally.\nTerrorism is insanity and death, and regrettably\nthere will always be fanatics who are ready to kill to\nimpose their insanity through force, ready to scatter the\nseed of evil. The seed of evil cannot take root when it\nfalls on the rock of justice, well-being, freedom and\nhope, but it can take root if it lands on the soil of\ninjustice, poverty, humiliation and despair.\nRedressing the major political and economic\ninjustices that devastate our world would therefore\ndeprive terrorists of their popular support. The more\npeople there are who have decent living conditions\naround the world, the safer we will all be.\n35\n\nIn this context, I would like to speak about Iraq.\nBut first of all I would like to speak about the\nthousands of victims of this conflict: the Iraqis, the\nsoldiers, the civilians who have lost their lives. We\nextend to them and to their countries our steady\nsolidarity.\nThe overwhelming majority of people in Spain\nspoke out against the war. We were not persuaded by\nthe arguments offered by those who promoted the war.\nWe expressed our views in the Spanish Parliament and\nin the streets. We spoke out loudly, we shouted. We\nalso said that winning the war would be much easier\nthan winning the peace. Peace must be our task - a\ntask that requires more courage, more determination\nand more heroism than the war. That is why the\nSpanish troops returned from Iraq.\nIn any event, what really matters now is to help\nfully restore the sovereignty and independence of\nIraq - a democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbours.\nWe will spare no effort in that task. And so Spain\nactively participated in the drafting of Security Council\nresolution 1546 (2004) and will continue to offer\npolitical and financial support for the process of\npolitical normalization and strengthening Iraqi\ndemocratic institutions.\nThere will be neither security nor stability in the\nworld as long as the Middle East conflict continues to\nbleed. That conflict is the primary tumour for many\nsources of instability.\nSpain firmly supports resolutions adopted by the\nUnited Nations, and other instruments such as the\nQuartet's road map, which is yet to be implemented.\nThe time we are wasting is to be measured in terms of\nhuman lives.\nSpain stands by Israel against the terrible scourge\nof terrorism, against which it is entitled to defend itself\nby legitimate means. Spain firmly defends the\nestablishment of a viable, democratic Palestinian State\nthat can live in peace and security with the State of\nIsrael. Israel will be able to count on the international\ncommunity to the extent that it respects international\nlaw, but the placement of the dividing wall fails to do\nthat.\nSpain will spare no political, diplomatic or\ncooperation effort to try and bring about the peace that\nis so needed in the Middle East. But from this rostrum,\nwe would also like to extend an urgent appeal to the\nUnited States, the European Union, Russia and the\nUnited Nations to implement the road map. Those are\nfour powerful players indeed, and we want to see them\nexerting decisive diplomatic pressure.\nIn the humanitarian field, Spain has contributed\nseveral million euros to help alleviate the terrible crisis\nin Darfur. However, the Sudanese authorities must,\nwithout delay, take all measures necessary to end the\natrocities, bring the perpetrators to justice and\nnormalize the situation in the region. It is also\nnecessary for the rebel groups and militias to respect\nthe ceasefire and show a constructive attitude at the\nnegotiating table. In this context, we must support the\ninitiatives of the African Union.\nSpain believes we can no longer passively accept\nthe continuation of Africa's forgotten conflicts, and\nthat is why, with partners in the European Union, we\nsupported the establishment of the African Peace\nFacility, an instrument designed to promote regional\nsolutions to crises in Africa.\nIn the Maghreb, Spain is pursuing an active and\ncomprehensive policy to enhance political stability and\neconomic and social development in the region.\nRegional integration and interdependence with Spain\nand Europe is, we believe, the way to reach those\ngoals.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Spain strongly\nsupports the search for a just and definitive political\nsolution that is accepted by all parties and respects the\nprinciples set forth in the resolutions of the United\nNations. From this rostrum I appeal to all the parties\ninvolved to redouble their efforts, within the\nframework of dialogue and negotiations established by\nthe United Nations, to resolve a conflict that has\ndragged on for far too long.\nMay I confirm Spain's commitment to\npeacekeeping operations - a fundamental part of\neffective multilateralism that we are seeking to\nencourage. Our political commitment is reflected in\nspecific contributions in the form of military\ncontingents for Afghanistan and Haiti, in accordance\nwith explicit Security Council mandates.\nPeace and security will spread through the world\nonly with the strength of the United Nations, the\nstrength of international legality, the strength of human\nrights, of democracy, of men abiding by the law, with\nequality of men and women, with equality of\n36\n\nopportunities, no matter where people are born. We\nreject those who would manipulate us or wish to\nimpose any kind of religion or belief. The strength of\neducation and culture is essential, for culture is always\npeace. Let us ensure that our perception of others is\ncoloured by respect. There must be dialogue among\npeoples.\nThus, as a representative of a country created and\nenriched by divers cultures, in this Assembly I want to\npropose an alliance of civilizations between the\nWestern and the Arab and Muslim worlds. Some years\nago a wall fell. We must now prevent hatred and a lack\nof understanding from building another wall. Spain\nproposes to the Secretary-General - whose work at\nthe head of this organization we firmly support \u00f3 the\npossibility of establishing a high-level group to move\nahead with this initiative.\nThis is the house of nations, but I see only\nwomen and men. I hear only the voices of women and\nmen who represent billions of other women and men.\nMany of these voices - many feeble and barely\naudible, the voices of children, the weak, the\nhopeless - come from lands devastated by poverty\nand inequality.\nIt is they whom I now want to address to declare\nthat Spain strongly supports the Millennium\nDeclaration Goals with respect to development,\npoverty eradication and the preservation of the\nenvironment. Poverty is the main cause of uncontrolled\nmigration flows. But no wall, no matter how tall, can\nprevent those who suffer from trying to escape poverty\nin order to recover their dignity as human beings.\nFor those reasons, we are firmly committed to the\npolitical declaration we adopted yesterday within the\nframework of the International Alliance Against\nHunger - promoted by President Lula da Silva -\nwhich establishes new ways to fund development. The\nGovernment of Spain will substantially increase its\nofficial development assistance in order to reach the\nthreshold of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.\nIn order for there to be peace, security and hope\nall over the world, international instruments for the\npromotion and protection of human rights need to be\nstrengthened and effectively implemented. That is one\nof the basic pillars of our foreign policy. Our objectives\nare the signing and ratification of the Optional Protocol\nto the Convention against Torture, the universal\nabolition of the death penalty, the effort to end\ndiscrimination against women, gender-based violence\nand discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation,\nthe protection of children and the combating of child\nabuse and exploitation, and the strict observance of\nhuman rights in the fight against terrorism and crime.\nWorld peace and security require respect for\nlegality. Therefore, Spain wishes to promote the\neffective functioning of the International Criminal\nCourt. To that end, I call upon all States that have yet\ndone so to ratify the Statute of the Court fully,\nunconditionally and without delay and thus help us in\nour common endeavour to build a world that is more\njust.\nMy Government wholeheartedly supports the\nUnited Nations reform process set out in the\nMillennium Declaration and endorses the Secretary-\nGeneral\u00eds initiatives for the reform and institutional\nstrengthening of the Organization. Spain believes that\nit is essential for the future of the international order\nthat the reform be aimed at ensuring effective\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions, in\nparticular those of the Security Council.\nThe Security Council must be made more\nrepresentative, democratic, effective and transparent.\nTo that end, Spain is willing to consider new proposals\nfor achieving consensus on increasing the number of\nnon-permanent members and on the use of the veto\npower.\nI want to reaffirm Spain's commitment to the just\ncauses of the Latin American peoples and to\nconsolidating democratic systems and political stability\nin the region. I reaffirm our support for economic\nprogress aimed at reducing inequality and\nstrengthening social cohesion. Within the European\nUnion, we will continue to promote a closer\nrelationship with that region through the development\nof a strategic partnership between both sides of the\nAtlantic.\nI would not wish to conclude my statement\nwithout referring to the question of Gibraltar. Every\nyear, the General Assembly reiterates its calls to Spain\nand the United Kingdom to pursue bilateral\nnegotiations in order to reach a definitive solution to\nthe dispute. I affirm that my country will continue its\nwillingness to negotiate a solution that benefits the\n37\n\nregion as a whole and heeds the wishes of that non-\nautonomous territory.\nThe United Nations was born of necessity and\nideals. It was built by women and men who affirmed\ntheir faith in understanding among peoples and\ncultures. They left us a legacy of utopia. They thought\nthat everything was within their reach: the settlement\nof old conflicts, the eradication of poverty, rights for\nall human beings. Today we could ask ourselves, what\nis within our reach?\nAlmost everything is. It is true that the history of\nhumankind does not give us many reasons to be\noptimistic. Nor does the world today offer us many\nreasons to feel superior to the men that preceded us.\nOne out of three countries in the world does not have a\nfree system. Torture continues to exist. There are more\nthan 30 armed conflicts around the world today. Half of\nthe war victims are children. Millions of people are\nsuffering from AIDS. One billion human beings subsist\non a dollar a day. More than 800 million adults are\nilliterate. More than 150 million children are without\naccess to any kind of education. More than 1 billion\npeople lack safe drinking water. No, we human beings\ncannot feel very proud of ourselves.\nWe must fight to overcome this situation. We, the\nSpanish women and men of today, are resolved to make\nit possible for the women and men who come after us\nto be able to say: yes, they did do it."

The\noutstanding qualities that have won you this distinction\nundoubtedly constitute a guarantee that our work will\nprogress well. I am convinced that advances will be\nmade in the search for viable and lasting solutions to\nthe different problems confronting the international\ncommunity. I also wish to express our gratitude to\nMinister Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia, whose far-\nsightedness and sense of balance gave decisive weight\nto his initiatives to give new dynamics to the work of\nthe General Assembly during the last session.\nI also want to pay tribute to the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to reiterate\nto him, on behalf of the Haitian people, our deepest\n9\n\nappreciation for the constant interest that he has shown\nin Haiti. This is also an opportunity for me to express\nto you, Mr. President, and to the United Nations family\nmy deepest thanks for the expressions of sympathy\ntowards \u2014 and solidarity with \u2014 the Haitian people,\nonce again struck by terrible floods on 18 and\n19 September 2004.\nSince 1945, our Organization has given proof of\nits capacity for survival and renewal. Nonetheless, the\nrecent course of events in certain parts of the world is\nof constant concern. The imposing of terror as a form\nof political expression is completely unacceptable. In\nthis regard, Haiti endorses the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council. The spiral of violence, which\ntragically affects civilian populations here and\nelsewhere, is an attack on human dignity and on the\nculture of peace that the United Nations embodies. The\nUnited Nations must necessarily play its role in the\nforefront, in accordance with the United Nations\nCharter, in the settlement of disputes that threaten\ninternational peace and security. The Republic of Haiti\nwishes to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals and to\nthe principles of universality of our Organization and\nto the objectives of peace and development to be\nattained through international cooperation.\nWhile the Republic of Haiti celebrates, this year,\nthe bicentenary of its independence, it has had to\nrequest the solidarity of the United Nations to help in\nthe stabilization of the situation in the country,\nfollowing the events of 29 February 2004. The Haitian\npeople express their appreciation to the Security\nCouncil, which, at my request, gave the international\ncommunity the mandate to help Haiti in the process of\npolitical transition by virtue of Security Council\nresolutions 1529 (2004) and 1542 (2004).\nSeven months after the major political events that\ntook place in Haiti, I have come here to bear witness to\nthe hopes that democratic renewal is inspiring in the\nHaitian population. I am also here to say, on behalf of\nthe Haitian people and their Government, that the\nRepublic of Haiti has never felt as close to the\nprinciples and the objectives of the United Nations,\nwhich, at the height of our distress, showed its interest\nin a future of freedom, democracy and collective well-\nbeing in Haiti.\nOn 29 February 2004, in accordance with the\nprinciples of the Haitian Constitution and in my\ncapacity as Chief Justice of our Supreme Court, I took\nmy oath as interim President of the Republic. Fifteen\ndays later, a Government of transition was established,\nwith the participation of the political and social forces\nof the country. The transition over which I am\npresiding is designed to be inclusive. The democratic\nprocess has begun. Political parties are forming, and\nothers are reorganizing themselves. A constant and\nfruitful dialogue has begun between the authorities of\nthe State, the political class and civil society\norganizations in the country. In that same spirit, a\nmutually satisfactory agreement was reached on\n18 September between the Government authorities and\nthe representatives of the demobilized military. This\nthus spared the nation a bloodbath and a pointless\nfratricidal struggle.\nI pledged, before the Haitian nation, to put an end\nto the political transition that dated back some 20\nyears. May this transition put an end to the transition.\nGeneral elections will be organized in 2005. The\nGovernment resolutely supports this process, and, on\n7 February 2006, I must and will hand power over to a\ndemocratically elected President.\nI thank those States that made the deployment of\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti\n(MINUSTAH) possible, particularly those that have\nmade or will make contingents available to the\nmission. I invite MINUSTAH to work more closely\nwith the Haitian authorities for genuine disarmament in\nthe country. It is not admissible that armed groups\ncommit their misdeeds with impunity, without being\nthe least disturbed by the presence of MINUSTAH.\nThe Haitian national police is steadily strengthening.\nThe transitional Government counts on international\ncooperation to make that strengthening not only\nquantitative, but qualitative, in terms of training and\nequipment.\nWithout the active and sustained support of the\ninternational community, the objectives of the\ntransitional Government might not be achieved. That\nfailure would mean a return to anarchy and chaos in\nHaiti and would be a grave setback to the United\nNations.\nHowever, Haiti has a fresh look. All freedoms are\nguaranteed, international commitments are respected\nand justice again prevails. Unfortunately, the\nGovernment of Haiti and its intentions were recently\nquestioned, following a verdict in which no member of\nthe executive branch had any role whatsoever, and that,\n10\n\nin accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the\nRepublic.\nThe necessary reform of the Haitian judicial\nsystem is clearly an imperative. But it is fundamentally\nunjust to blame the present Government of brazen\ninterference in judiciary proceedings or to\nsystematically bleed magistrates and the civil servants\nin charge of establishing the law.\nThe Government of Haiti is extremely sensitive\nto the comments and remarks of its friends and partners\nwith whom it is cooperating in all fields of political,\neconomic and social governance; but it refuses to be\nassociated with or connected to decisions that involve\nonly one organ of the State, which acted completely\nindependently, even if those decisions might raise\ncertain questions.\nWhat must not be forgotten is that I am still\nPresident of the Court of Appeals, provisionally\nexercising the function of President of the Republic.\nTherefore, I cannot tolerate any arbitrary action, nor\ncan I tolerate any interference of the political authority\nin the judiciary system. Justice must be independent.\nGuaranteeing security, promoting freedom and\nhuman dignity, promoting economic growth and social\ndevelopment, preparing the provisional electoral\ncouncil for the holding of honest, credible and clean\nelections \u2014 those are the objectives that the\nGovernment of Haiti intends to achieve through its\nprogramme of action, within the current climate of\nexceptional difficulties.\nFor that reason, I make a solemn appeal from this\nrostrum to the international community, to friendly\ncountries, to the specialized agencies of the United\nNations system, and to all of those for whom solidarity\nis not just word that special attention, beyond symbolic\ngestures, be given to the Republic of Haiti so that a\nsubstantial and well-directed cooperative effort may\nhelp mobilize the necessary resources, with a view to\nimmediate and long-term action, and may promote the\nreturn of sustained growth in Haiti following years of\nstagnation.\nThe people of Haiti are starting anew, and it is\nnatural that at this time they should turn to the United\nNations. Based upon the values and objectives that we\nshare, Haiti seeks the understanding of its natural\npartners so that it can at last break the infernal cycle of\nviolence and isolation in which it has lived for too\nlong."

        "file_text": "I would\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. This election is a tribute to Africa and to the\nbrotherly State of Gabon. I am sure that you will carry\non the commendable work initiated by your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, with a view to\nrevitalizing the role played by the United Nations and\nto enhancing its prestige.\nI should also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, for his untiring efforts\nto achieve the objectives of our Organization. I want to\nassure him, once again, of our trust in him and of our\nfull support.\nThe world today is faced with major risks and\nperils of such magnitude that a renewed multilateral\nsystem is required. In that regard, we must ask\nourselves if the United Nations system, in its present\nform, is capable of providing effective solutions to the\nnumerous problems that are disrupting the international\norder.\nThe end of the cold war, along with progress in\nscience and technology and the opening of markets,\nshould have led to greater security and prosperity, but,\ninstead, the world is still encountering distressing\nconflicts, which cause considerable human and\nmaterial loss, to the detriment of development. Human\nvalues and ideals are on the decline, while fanaticism,\nextremism and terrorism are on the rise. The gap\nbetween a rich North and a poor South is widening.\nIt is Africa that suffers the most from the\nscourges of poverty, hunger, desertification and deadly\nepidemics, in addition to the problems of illegal\nimmigration, refugees and forced displacement. The\ncountries of the South cannot effectively cope with\nthese scourges on their own without successful\nregional and international coordination, as well as\neffective support for local development efforts.\nThese problems, and their pernicious impact,\nwhich is compounded by ethnic strife as well as by\nregional tensions and conflicts, not only cause terrible\nsuffering but also hamper progress, development,\nregional integration and the transition towards\ndemocracy. The international community is therefore\ncalled upon to pool its efforts so that the logic of\ndialogue and negotiation may prevail over that of\nforce, destruction and war. It must give fresh impetus\nto preventive diplomacy, at the regional and\ninternational levels, in order to preserve peace and\nsecurity on our continent.\nIn that regard, Morocco considers that the\nartificial dispute over the Sahara is, regrettably, still\nhindering the establishment of the Arab Maghreb\nUnion. I should like to reiterate my country\u00eds readiness\nto cooperate in a sincere and determined way with the\nUnited Nations and all the parties concerned in order to\nachieve, within the framework of international legality,\na final, negotiated political solution that would\nguarantee the sovereignty, national unity and territorial\nintegrity of the Kingdom of Morocco, and enable the\ninhabitants of its southern provinces to manage their\nregional affairs by themselves, in a democratic, stable\nenvironment conducive to integrated development.\nSuch a solution would spare the area the risk of\nbecoming a hotbed of tension. It would also foster\nMaghreb integration and enable the region fully to play\nits role in the Mediterranean and in its relations with\nAfrican countries of the Sahel, thereby sparing the\nwhole of north-west Africa the risk of Balkanization\nand the threats of international terrorism.\nAs an active member of the African family and of\nthe international community, the Kingdom of Morocco\nis keen to continue cooperating with the United\nNations and the world community to settle disputes\nthrough peaceful means, volunteering to participate in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions, as is currently\nthe case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nin C\u00d9te d\u00edIvoire. Morocco is also eager to help bring\nabout reconciliation and the settlement of disputes\nthrough peaceful means, as illustrated by the mediation\nundertaken by my country to resolve the crisis in the\nMano River region.\nMorocco takes pride in contributing to African\nendeavours designed to meet the challenge of\nachieving peace, development, progress and good\ngovernance \u00f3 the very objectives of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u00eds Development. Since the\naccomplishment of those ambitious goals exceeds the\ncapabilities of African countries and requires\nconsiderable resources, I urge the international\ncommunity to support this initiative and to find\ngenerous and effective solutions to the debt problem.\nMorocco has already taken steps in that direction.\nAs far as the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned,\nmy country is as determined as ever to work with the\ninternational community to find a just, comprehensive\n23\n\nand lasting solution within the framework of\ninternational legality - a solution that guarantees\nIsrael\u00eds withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories\nand the establishment of a viable, independent\nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,\nliving side by side, in peace and concord, with the\nState of Israel.\nI should like to stress that, as Chairman of the\nAl-Quds Committee, I am always ready to undertake\nwhatever initiatives are needed and to support\nmeaningful endeavours to restore peace to this region,\nwarning anew of the negative implications of the\nviolation of religious sanctities.\nMorocco hopes that no effort will be spared to\nhelp brotherly Iraq out of its current predicament and\nto support its Interim Government in its efforts to\nensure stability and security for Iraqis and to create the\nright conditions to initiate constructive dialogue and\norganize elections which will enable all components of\nthe Iraqi population to choose their institutions freely\nand peacefully.\nIn order to meet the challenges at this turning\npoint in history, the international community has no\nalternative but to revitalize the current multilateral\nsystem.\nAfter the First and Second World Wars, nations\nrealized that it was necessary to establish a global\nsystem to govern international relations, within the\nframework of law and legality. Setting up an\nalternative global system would not resolve the\nproblem of the fierce trade wars currently raging\nworldwide, nor the ethnic conflicts, ideological\nfanaticism and perils of terrorism, whether latent or\napparent. I am convinced that the United Nations,\nwhich has helped solve countless crises, is perfectly\ncapable of managing the current international situation\nin a peaceful and civilized way, by revitalizing the\nmultilateral system.\nSuch an objective, however, can be achieved only\nif the United Nations is provided with the kind of\nresources and means needed to meet the geo-strategic\nrequirements of the twenty-first century, and if its\nworking methods and its organs \u00f3 including the\nSecurity Council \u00f3 are reformed and invigorated. The\nUnited Nations system would then become an ideal\nforum for negotiation and interaction between cultures\nand religions. Furthermore, it would be effectively\ninstrumental in upholding human ideals, enhancing\nsecurity and stability and promoting sustainable\ndevelopment.\nMorocco, through its chairmanship of the Group\nof 77 and China and its participation in various\nregional and international events, including the Doha,\nMonterrey and Johannesburg conferences, has sought\nto contribute effectively to building this multilateral\nsystem, as a top priority on its diplomatic agenda. My\ncountry will continue to work for the implementation\nof the Millennium Goals, urging countries as well as\ninternational financial and trade institutions to honour\ntheir obligations. Morocco reaffirms its commitment to\nsupport the emergence of a new multilateral system\nbuilt on international legality, justice and equity and\ncooperation in social and economic relations, and\nbased on an efficient and dynamic United Nations\nsystem.\nThis is the course of action to be taken to enhance\ntrust in the United Nations as the conscience of\nhumankind and the bedrock of a new world order,\nwhere the values of peace, global security, joint\ndevelopment, equality, tolerance, democracy and\nsolidarity prevail."

        "file_text": "I want to talk today about\nUnited Nations reform, particularly about the way we\nshould serve and the way we should do business if the\nUnited Nations is to play the role we want it to in the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe world is organized into independent States\nand the primary obligation of Governments is to look\nafter their own people. This presents us with a\nfundamental dilemma, for unless we also act\ncollectively on the basis of our common humanity, the\nrich will become richer, the poor will become poorer,\nand hundreds of millions of people will be at risk.\nThus, we need institutions whose primary obligation is\nto our common humanity. Herein lies the importance of\nthe United Nations. It comprises Member States, but its\nmission is, indeed, to serve the world's peoples. Its\nCharter makes this very clear:\n'We the peoples of the United Nations [are]\ndetermined - to reaffirm faith in fundamental\nhuman rights, in the dignity and worth of the\nhuman person, in the equal rights of men and\nwomen.'\nOthers, quite properly, will talk about structural\nreform. But today I want to talk about reforms\ndesigned to put our common humanity at the centre of\nthe agenda of the United Nations.\nCanada sees five areas where bold steps are\nrequired. The first area is the responsibility to\nprotect - the need to develop the rules and the\npolitical will that would allow the international\ncommunity to intervene in countries to prevent a\nhumanitarian catastrophe.\nDarfur is a human tragedy of immense\nproportions.\n(spoke in French)\nWe welcome the Security Council's support for\nexpanded engagement there, although we believe the\ninternational response should be more robust. The\nAfrican Union, which has agreed to lead that effort,\nmust have the unswerving support of the international\ncommunity. Canada is offering $20 million to assist,\nand we call on others to join in now.\n(spoke in English)\nIt is good that the international community is\nfinally moving, but it has taken far too long. The\nSecurity Council has been bogged down in debating\nthe issue. It has looked at whether Darfur is a threat to\ninternational peace and security. It is considering\nwhether the tragedy qualifies as genocide, because\neither could provide justification, under international\nlaw, for intervention. The fact is, though, that, while\nthe international community struggles with definitions,\nthe people of Darfur struggle with disaster. They are\nhungry, they are homeless, they are sick, and many\nhave been driven out of their own country. Tens of\nthousands have been murdered, raped and assaulted.\nWar crimes and crimes against humanity are being\ncommitted.\nWe must not let debates about definitions become\nobstacles to action. We should not have to go through\nsuch painful exercises to figure out how to respond to\nhumanitarian catastrophe. We need clear principles that\n31\n\nwill allow the international community to intervene\nmuch faster in situations like the one in Darfur.\nOur common humanity should be a powerful\nenough argument, and yet that is precisely what is\nmissing. Put simply, there is still no explicit provision\nin international law for intervention on humanitarian\ngrounds. The 'responsibility to protect' is intended to\nfill that gap. It says that we should have the legal right\nto intervene in a country on the grounds of\nhumanitarian emergency alone. We should be able to\ndo so when the Government of a country is unwilling\nor unable to protect its people from extreme harm as a\nresult of internal war, repression or, simply, State\nfailure.\nThe primary responsibility for the protection of a\nState's own population lies with that State itself. We\nare not arguing for a unilateral right to intervene in one\ncountry whenever another country feels like it. It is\nalways preferable to have multilateral authority for\nintervention in the affairs of a sovereign State. What\nwe seek is the evolution of international law and\npractice so that multilateral action may be taken in\nsituations of extreme humanitarian emergency.\nInternational law is moving in the right direction.\nExisting instruments such as the Convention on\nGenocide and human rights treaties acknowledge\nStates\u00ed obligations to their own people. The\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\ncriminal tribunals are further steps forward. Thus\ncustomary international law is evolving to provide a\nsolid basis in the building of a normative framework\nfor collective humanitarian intervention. To speed it\nalong, however, Member States should now adopt a\nGeneral Assembly resolution recognizing the evolution\nof sovereignty to encompass the international\nresponsibility to people. In turn, the Security Council\nshould establish new thresholds for when the\ninternational community judges that civilian\npopulations face extreme threats; and for exploring\nnon-military and, if necessary, proportionate military\noptions to protect civilians. The responsibility to\nprotect is not a license for intervention; it is an\ninternational guarantor of political accountability.\nThe second area I would speak to is the\n'responsibility to deny', which encompasses the need\nto ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not\nunder any circumstances spread to States or terrorists\nprepared to use them, especially against innocent\ncivilians. Non-proliferation and disarmament remain\nfundamental pillars of the commitment of the United\nNations to international peace and security.\nIn both cases, multilateralism has been\nchallenged by dramatic changes in the security climate,\nand there is a clear need to make our systems stronger\nand more responsive. Strict verification is the key.\nThe United Nations nuclear watchdog, the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, needs stronger\ntools, and it needs political support. We need more\nrigorous controls on sensitive nuclear technology, and\nthe Security Council must be prepared to deal with\nnon-compliance effectively. The fact is that, as we all\nknow, determined proliferators have been able to\ncircumvent their treaty obligations. The United Nations\nshould establish a permanent inspection and\nverification mechanism that can reinforce and\nsupplement existing verification systems.\nMore generally, and to show how far we have to\ngo on the disarmament agenda, and on the\nresponsibility to deny, the Conference on\nDisarmament, charged with the responsibility for\nnegotiating new multilateral instruments, has not even\nbeen able to agree on a work plan since 1998. Surely\nthe Conference must get back to productive work.\n(spoke in French)\nThe third area is the 'responsibility to respect'\nhuman beings, their dignity, their freedom and their\nculture. I would like to talk about a broader notion of\nhuman rights - one that can encompass individual\nrights, the protection of collective rights and pluralism,\nas reflected in the concept of cultural diversity. In fact,\nthe United Nations Development Programme\u00eds recent\nHuman Development Report stresses that cultural\ndiversity is also tied in with freedom. That is why we\nsupport a United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization instrument on cultural\npromotion.\nSince the United Nations Charter and the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, humanity has\nmade remarkable strides in the area of human rights.\nConventions are now in place to protect a number of\nrights: civil, political, economic, social and cultural.\nBut we must remain vigilant in the face of new forms\nof abuse, such as international trafficking of people and\nthe horrifying child sex trade.\n32\n\nIn addition to the protections afforded individual\nrights, various conventions have also been concluded\nto better protect minorities, to denounce racial\ndiscrimination and to combat marginalization.\nNevertheless, it is apparent that the most divisive\nconflicts result, more often than not, from attempts by\none group to prevent other groups from realizing their\nperfectly legitimate economic, religious, social or\npolitical aspirations. Entire communities are\nthreatened. Violence, civil strife and even failed States\nensue. Kosovo, Bosnia, the Great Lakes region in\nAfrica, and today Darfur are the most chilling\nexamples. The international community must take\nvigorous action to protect individuals as well as\nminority communities. It is not enough to simply\npossess various legal instruments; they must be put\ninto practice. Institutions responsible for human rights\nmust reveal to the entire world those guilty of abuse -\nbe they armed groups, communities or Governments -\nand take the necessary measures. The United Nations is\nour moral conscience and it is up to us to act.\nThe fourth area is the responsibility to build. The\nobjectives of the Millennium Summit on poverty,\ndisease and global insecurity will come to naught if we\ndo not follow up on the Monterrey Consensus,\naccording to which genuine development requires a\nholistic approach to such issues as debt, market access\nand social investment.\nThat being said, as we have seen in Haiti over the\npast 10 years, all the aid in the world will have only a\nfleeting effect if a country does not have functioning\npublic institutions. We must build countries'\ngovernance capacities and take the time to do it right.\nThe same is true for economic institutions. Those that\nwork well marshal the creative energies of local\nentrepreneurs. That is the message of the United\nNations Commission on the Private Sector and\nDevelopment: a thriving economy is the product of\ncitizens' trust in their country\u00eds public institutions. In\nbrief, development depends on governance.\nLastly, there is responsibility for the future,\nwhich is to say the obligation we have to leave a better\nworld for our children. That is no small challenge. It\ninvolves all aspects of our common heritage: health,\nthe environment, oceans, space. The new pandemics\ndemand our most urgent attention. AIDS, SARS and\nthe Ebola virus are sounding a terrifying alarm, but\nscientists are predicting even worse diseases. The\nWorld Health Organization must bolster its\nsurveillance systems. It must do a better job\ncoordinating its actions with those of other United\nNations bodies.\nBeyond health issues lies the whole question of\nmanaging our environment. It is gravely threatened.\nOnly international cooperation and technical assistance\ncan bring lasting solutions to such problems as access\nto clean air and water. Furthermore, we need an oceans\npolicy that allows us to rebuild our fish stocks. Access\nto fisheries must be better regulated under international\nlaw. Simply put, the pillage of those global resources\nmust stop.\nSpace is our final frontier. It has always captured\nour imagination. What a tragedy it would be if space\nbecame one big weapons arsenal and the scene of a\nnew arms race. In 1967, the United Nations agreed that\nweapons of mass destruction must not be based in\nspace. The time has come to extend that ban to all\nweapons.\n(spoke in English)\nI have talked today about responsibilities. In\nconclusion, let me mention one more: the\nresponsibility to act. We await the report of the\nSecretary-General\u00eds High-Level Panel and we\nanticipate substantial recommendations for reform.\nMany countries are focused on the Security Council\nand we should support reforms that will make it more\neffective and will permit those countries which actively\nsupport United Nations peacekeeping, development\nand other activities to continue to have a meaningful\nopportunity to serve.\nBut we must also look forward to\nrecommendations that go well beyond the Security\nCouncil. For example, there is a need to set out\nmeasures to facilitate an integrated response to the\ndiverse range of security challenges that each of us\nfaces, from the proliferation of terrorism to improving\nUnited Nations coordination on development, health\nand the environment. As individual countries, as\nindividual members of regional organizations, and as\nparticipants in various international groups that form\naround specific interests, we all must act to bridge the\ndifferences that divide us and to forge an international\nconsensus for reform of the United Nations.\nIn another context, for instance, Canada has\nproposed a special meeting at which leaders from 20 or\nso countries in the developed and developing worlds\n33\n\nwould get together to discuss our collective challenges\nand responsibilities. This could very well include\nproviding a major boost to United Nations reform\nefforts.\nIn any event, no matter how one comes at it, the\ntime has come for real reform of the United Nations.\nAll of us in this Hall and in our respective\nGovernments must put aside narrow interests and work\nto common purpose to strengthen this universal\ninstitution, whose activities give force to our common\nhumanity.\nFour years ago, at the Millennium Summit, the\nleaders of the world agreed that 'we have a duty - to\nall the world's people, especially the most vulnerable'\n(resolution 55/2, para. 2). That duty will not be\ndischarged unless we as Governments speak to the\ndignity and to the freedom of every human being on\nEarth, here at the world's meeting place of nations."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to address the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf of\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nAllow me to extend my congratulations to you,\nMr. President, on your election, and to wish you well in\nyour endeavours throughout this session.\nThis year has seen important landmarks for the\nMarshall Islands at the domestic level. On 1 May we\ncelebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption\nof our Constitution. The same day also marked the\nentry into force of our amended Compact of Free\nAssociation with the United States. The renewal of that\nagreement reaffirms the special relationship between\nour two countries.\nAt the regional level, we continue to place great\nimportance on our membership in the Pacific Islands\nForum. Over the past year, the Forum has conducted a\ncomprehensive review of existing regional\nmechanisms. Last month Pacific leaders met in Samoa,\nwhere they endorsed the terms of reference of a new\nPacific Plan, which will develop a strategy for broader\nregional cooperation based on the key goals of\neconomic growth, sustainable development, good\ngovernance and security.\nAt the international level, the Marshall Islands\nreaffirms its solidarity with the Alliance of Small\nIsland States (AOSIS), which continues to act as a\npowerful voice for small island developing States.\nIt has long been recognized that small island\ndeveloping States suffer from unique vulnerabilities\nand disadvantages. In January 2005, the international\ncommunity will meet in Mauritius to conduct the\n10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States. Over the past year, members of\nAOSIS have been engaged in a detailed process of\npreparation for the international meeting. At an\ninterregional meeting in January, small island\ndeveloping States adopted the AOSIS Strategy for the\nFurther Implementation of the Barbados Programme of\nAction, which addresses critical issues including\nclimate change and sea-level rise, renewable energy,\ntrade access and others.\nIt is vital that we maintain the momentum in the\nlead-up to Mauritius in order to ensure a successful\noutcome for small island developing States. I\nencourage the international community to become\nengaged in the ongoing preparatory process and to\nparticipate in the international meeting at the highest\nlevel. It is our fervent hope that the meeting will\nproduce practical outcomes that will assist small island\ndeveloping States in implementing the Programme of\nAction to benefit people at the local level.\nIn this increasingly globalized world, the\nMarshall Islands faces challenges shared by many\nother small island States. Our environment is extremely\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change and natural\ndisasters; our small population faces the challenge of\nmanaging high levels of major diseases such as\ndiabetes, and the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS\nand other sexually transmitted diseases; and our limited\nresource base and remoteness restrict our ability to\nintegrate into the global economy.\nWith these challenges in mind, the Marshall\nIslands is particularly concerned about the following\nissues.\nFirst, regarding sustainable development, the\nMarshall Islands has developed a national sustainable\ndevelopment strategy, and we are in the process of\nestablishing a task force to ensure that the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals are fully integrated into our\nnational strategy. In striving to achieve internationally\nagreed development goals, we are severely constrained\nby our lack of human and technical resources. Thus we\ncontinue to seek to form partnerships that will assist us\nthrough capacity-building and technology transfer.\nWe were pleased that the twelfth session of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development focused on\nwater, sanitation and human settlements. We in the\nPacific region are working hard to improve access to\nfresh water and to develop environmentally responsible\nwaste-management systems. We seek the support of the\ninternational community to assist us in the\nimplementation of regional projects such as the Pacific\nRegional Action Plan on Sustainable Water\nManagement. We look forward to the thirteenth session\nof the Commission\u2019s providing further policy guidance\nin these areas.\n23\n\nAn ongoing issue of the utmost concern for the\npeople of the Marshall Islands is that of nuclear-\nweapon testing. Between 1946 and 1958, the United\nStates conducted a series of nuclear tests in the\nMarshall Islands, which included the detonation of 23\natomic and hydrogen bombs. On 1 March this year we\ncommemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Bravo\ntest at Bikini atoll. The Bravo blast was 1,000 times\nmore powerful than Hiroshima, and its fallout spread\nradioactive debris across the neighbouring islands.\nToday, many of our people continue to suffer\nfrom the long-term health effects, while others remain\ndisplaced from their homes because of ongoing\ncontamination. We urge the United States Government\nto fully address the issue of adequate compensation for\npopulations affected by the nuclear testing programme\nand to fulfil its responsibilities regarding the safe\nresettlement of displaced populations.\nOn broader issues of disarmament and non-\nproliferation, we urge the international community to\nretain a focus on disarmament by the nuclear-weapon\nStates, as well as on non-proliferation measures. We\nlook forward to next year\u2019s Review Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, and we hope that the Conference\nwill produce substantial progress on the 13 steps\ntowards complete nuclear disarmament.\nI wish to reiterate our critical concern regarding\nclimate change. Along with other low-lying island\nnations, we are most vulnerable to the impacts of\nclimate change. We are already experiencing these\ndramatic effects: sea levels are rising, weather patterns\nare changing and coral reef systems are being harmed.\nUrgent action is needed at the global level to halt and\nultimately reverse the devastating impact of climate\nchange. Without such global action, our national efforts\nat sustainable development will ultimately be rendered\nmeaningless.\nWhile we are committed to playing our part,\nstrong leadership is required by the major\nindustrialized countries. We renew our support for the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\nKyoto Protocol, and we call upon all States that have\nnot yet done so \u2014 in particular the major emitters \u2014 to\nratify the Protocol without further delay. We also call\nupon the international community to assist small island\ndeveloping States in developing and implementing\ncomprehensive adaptation strategies.\nAs a nation whose livelihood depends on the\nresources of the sea, we are becoming increasingly\nconcerned about the state of the world\u2019s oceans and\nfish stocks. At the regional level, we cooperate closely\nwith other members of the Pacific Islands Forum to\nensure that the oceans and marine resources in our\nregion are managed in a responsible and sustainable\nmanner. The Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy,\nadopted in 2002, will be implemented throughout the\nregion under a recently developed framework for\nintegrated strategic action. Another notable\nachievement in the region is the entry into force of the\nConvention on the Conservation and Management of\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and\nCentral Pacific Ocean.\nWhile such developments are encouraging, we\nreiterate our concerns regarding the prevalence of\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Like many\nother small island developing States, we rely on\nfisheries resources as a primary means of survival, yet\nwe lack the capacity to adequately monitor our\nexclusive economic zone. Regional and international\ncooperation must focus on addressing the problem of\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and\nassisting small island developing States by building\ncapacity for monitoring and surveillance.\nI have briefly mentioned a few of the major\npriorities for the Marshall Islands. There are, of course,\nmany other important issues to be addressed during the\nupcoming session.\nInternational terrorism is obviously one of the\nbiggest challenges facing the global community today.\nThe reality is that no State or region is immune. All\nStates must take action at the national level and must\ncooperate at the regional and international levels to\nensure that we combat terrorist threats with\ncomprehensive and unified action. Within the Pacific\nregion, we continue to cooperate closely to ensure that\neffective regional action is taken to combat threats to\npeace and security. At the national level, we are in the\nprocess of implementing the 12 core anti-terrorism\nconventions and the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, and we have taken many steps to combat\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing.\nThe Marshall Islands, as a State party to the\nRome Statute, welcomes the ongoing progress of the\nInternational Criminal Court. We are pleased that the\nCourt is now fully operational and has begun its first\n24\n\ninvestigations. We are confident that the Court will\nplay a valuable role in the administration of justice at\nthe international level, and we urge those States that\nhave not yet done so to become parties.\nAnother issue requiring action by this body is the\ncontinued exclusion of Taiwan from the United\nNations. Taiwan is a peace-loving, sovereign State, and\nonly its democratically elected Government can be the\nlegitimate representative of the interests of the people\nof Taiwan within the United Nations. The Marshall\nIslands reiterates its full support for the ongoing quest\nof the people of Taiwan to be granted membership in\nthis global body and in various other international\norganizations.\nFinally, the Marshall Islands reiterates its support\nfor the expansion of the Security Council in both\ncategories of membership. We support the allocation of\na new permanent seat to Japan, and we believe that the\nrepresentation on the Council of developing countries\nmust be increased. Such expansion is crucial if the\nCouncil is to retain its legitimacy.\nMy delegation looks forward, Mr. President, to a\nproductive session under your able leadership."

        "file_text": "It is a source of pride for\nAfricans and our friends alike to see you, Sir, presiding\nover the demanding business of the fifty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly. You bring to your high office\nthe immense wisdom and experience you have gained\nover the years as a dedicated public servant and\nCabinet minister of the Gabonese Republic. You hold\nin your capable hands the mandate given to you by the\nCharter of the United Nations to give new impetus to\nthe promotion of peace, human security and sustainable\ndevelopment throughout the world. I congratulate you\nwarmly and pledge Namibia\u00eds full support to you\npersonally and to your Bureau.\nYou will recall, Mr. President, the renewed spirit\nand firm resolve for change demonstrated by African\nleaders in July 2002 in Durban, South Africa. There,\nwe stressed a new beginning for Africa in transforming\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nlaunching the African Union and its development arm,\nthe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD). We also reiterated our commitment to\nembrace the African diaspora in consolidating and\ntransforming our continent.\nI am, therefore, delighted to note that the\noutgoing President of the General Assembly, His\nExcellency Mr. Julian Hunte, hails from the sister\ncountry of Saint Lucia in the Caribbean. I pay tribute\nto him for his excellent and successful service to the\nUnited Nations. During his tenure of office, he showed\nleadership and dedication to world peace, security and\nsustainable development.\nWe are gathered once again at United Nations\nHeadquarters to reaffirm the precious ideals, principles\nand purposes of the Organization, and to transform\nthem into action towards ending armed conflict, saving\nour children and investing resources to eradicate\nhunger, disease and poverty in the world.\nOur illustrious and hardworking Secretary-\nGeneral, my dear brother Kofi Annan, has left no stone\nunturned in his tireless efforts to exert his authority in\nconflict situations. His insistence on the centrality and\nlegitimate responsibility of the Organization to be on\nthe side of the poor, the weak and the needy in the\nworld should be commended. In his annual report on\nthe work of the Organization (A/59/1), the Secretary-\nGeneral once again reminds Member States of the\nterrible state of the world, and offers real alternatives\nfor world peace and security, social development\nfinancing and the mitigation of the effects of the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and other infectious diseases. I\ncommend the Secretary-General for his worthy\ninterventions and effective leadership.\nDuring the 1999-2000 period, Namibia had the\nrare honour and privilege of serving the Organization\nin two capacities. My country served both as a non-\npermanent member of the Security Council and,\nsimultaneously, as President of the fifty-fourth session\nof the General Assembly, whose task, among others,\nwas to prepare for the Millennium Summit and the\nadoption of the historic Millennium Declaration. I was\nthus called upon to co-chair that Summit together with\nmy Finnish counterpart, Her Excellency Ms. Tarja\nHalonen.\nAt that memorable Summit, the largest ever\ngathering of world leaders unanimously endorsed the\nfar-reaching Millennium Development Goals and\ntargets. Today we all remain bound by that historic and\nunique undertaking. Member States collectively\npledged, among other things, to eradicate extreme\npoverty and hunger; achieve universal primary\neducation; promote gender equality and empower\nwomen; reduce child mortality and improve maternal\nhealth; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\nother diseases; ensure environmental sustainability;\nand develop a global partnership for sustainable\ndevelopment.\nBy endorsing those Development Goals and\ntargets, our Governments have made a serious and\nirrevocable commitment, through reliable public policy\ninterventions, to care for the millions of our children\nall over the world who are asking for nothing more\nthan love, protection and a peaceful childhood.\nIn this undertaking, we cannot ignore the ever-\nwidening income gap between the rich and the poor,\nbetween the industrialized North and the developing\nSouth. This situation represents a dangerous time\nbomb, which the world can ill afford to let take its own\ncourse. Our planet Earth is too small to perpetuate the\nunacceptable juxtaposition of abject poverty and\nabundant prosperity. We will deal with this situation\neffectively only when we promote mutually beneficial\ncommercial trade between the North and the South\nwithin the framework of North-South and South-South\ncooperation.\nI would like to emphasize that the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and targets by themselves are only\n7\n\ndeclarations of intent. Our Governments must translate\nthem into sustainable policies, buttressed by adequate\nfinancial and technological resources, to make a real\ndifference in the lives of our peoples.\nFor its part, Namibia, in cooperation with the\nrelevant United Nations agencies, has adopted a\ncountrywide programme to implement the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and targets. In addition to\ndeploying our own resolve and capabilities, we call\nupon other development partners to assist us in our\nnational efforts towards nation-building, reconciliation\nand transformation.\nAt the initiative of President Luiz Inacio Lula da\nSilva of the Federative Republic of Brazil, world\nleaders converged at United Nations Headquarters on\n20 September 2004 to exchange views and find\nworkable solutions aimed at bringing an end to hunger\nand poverty in the world. We commend him for that\nimportant initiative, in which we participated. At the\nend of the meeting, a declaration was adopted, which\nNamibia fully supports. We call upon Member States\nand other stakeholders to implement it with due\nurgency.\nThe world has enormous resources with which to\nfight and defeat poverty, hunger and\nunderdevelopment. In this process of dialogue, we\nmust insist on a realistic balance between the total\nworld spending on war and weapons technology on the\none hand and the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and targets on the other. What is\nrequired is political will and compassion on the part of\nworld leaders. The debate on weapons of mass\ndestruction must not divide United Nations Member\nStates, but should lead nations to find and enhance\npeaceful coexistence and cooperation. Developed\ncountries should consider their support to the countries\nof the South as an act of enlightened contribution to\nregional and global stability, and as a purposeful\nincentive to encourage increased mutually beneficial\ncommercial trade and investment among all nations.\nI wish to underline the significance of my\npresence at the current session of the General\nAssembly. Attached to my attendance are a long\nhistory, a personal journey and an unbroken link\nbetween Namibia and the United Nations over many\nyears. I entered this building for the first time in 1960,\nas a petitioner before the Fourth Committee of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThat was my first humble but determined\nemergence on the diplomatic scene. I have spent many\nyears since then, attending various United Nations\ndebates and conferences that dealt with the\ndecolonization of Namibia and negotiations on self-\ndetermination and independence. During those many\nyears, I addressed some of the Security Council\nmeetings held in respect of the question of Namibia,\nstarting in 1971, as the first freedom fighter accorded\nsuch an opportunity.\nI got to meet and know many distinguished\nstatesmen, diplomats, fellow petitioners and eminent\ninternational civil servants in New York, Geneva, Paris\nand other important conference venues. My Namibian\ncolleagues and I will always treasure the advice,\nsupport and solidarity we received from the United\nNations family, and from friends the world over. Many\nfriendly nations of the world stood firm and rendered\nmoral, material and diplomatic support to the noble\ncause of our freedom and independence.\nMany world-renowned revolutionaries,\nparticularly on the African continent, rendered selfless\nsacrifices, not only towards the independence of our\nmotherland, but also to free the African continent from\ncolonial exploitation and apartheid.\nI therefore would like to salute and pay homage\nto the visionary leaders of the African continent who\nshaped the vision of African unity and the continent\u00eds\nemancipation from the yoke of colonialism, foreign\noccupation and apartheid. Among them, I pay special\ntribute to Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of\nGhana; Ahmed Ben Bella, the first Prime Minister of\nAlgeria; Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt; Julius\nKambarage Nyerere of Tanzania; Kenneth Kaunda of\nZambia; General Murtala Mohammed of Nigeria;\nAntonio Agostinho Neto of Angola; and other African\nleaders and pan-Africanists.\nNamibia\u00eds protracted liberation struggle was\nbloody and bitter. It caused the untold suffering and\nsacrifices of our people inside the country and those of\nus who were forced to spend many decades in exile.\nAfter many years of struggle, the international\ncommunity finally recognized and endorsed the\nlegitimacy of our cause for freedom, equality and\njustice, led by our national liberation movement, the\nSouth-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) of\nNamibia.\n8\n\nNamibia became principally the legal\nresponsibility of the United Nations, and in that way a\nunique partnership was forged for a common cause\nbetween the world Organization and the struggling\nNamibian people, which endured for 30 daunting and\neventful years.\nOn 21 March 1990, His Excellency Javier Perez\nde Cuellar, then Secretary-General of the United\nNations, swore me in as President of the Republic of\nNamibia. Later in September of the same year, I\nreturned to the United Nations to address the General\nAssembly and, on behalf of my people, to thank the\nUnited Nations for the special partnership and the\nprincipled support in various forms that eventually\ngave birth to the 160th State Member of our\nOrganization.\nI paid tribute to those United Nations civil\nservants and members of the United Nations Transition\nAssistance Group (UNTAG) who served diligently to\nensure the full implementation of Security Council\nresolution 435 (1978). I also paid homage to those who\ndied in the course of their duty in Namibia.\nI wish to recall with appreciation that my initial\naccess to the United Nations was made possible by\nnon-governmental organizations, church groups, a\nhandful of United Nations staff members and\nconcerned diplomats from friendly countries. I\nsincerely thank them all. The Namibian people salute\nthem and will forever honour the memories we shared.\nAmong those many organizations, I wish to\nparticularly single out and pay deserved tribute to the\nAfrica-America Institute for its exceptional dedication\nto provide and expand educational opportunities to\nAfricans across our continent, including Namibians,\nboth before and after our independence. I join other\nAfrican leaders in welcoming the Africa-America\nInstitute\u00eds fiftieth anniversary education partnership\ncampaign, which I wholeheartedly recommend for\nglobal support.\nBy my own decision and in compliance with our\nConstitution, I will be serving as President of the\nRepublic only until 20 March 2005. I will then bid\nfarewell to my State duties and public functions. I am\nlooking forward to a less hectic life, but I will remain a\nfully engaged private citizen. I intend to undertake\ncertain causes that are dear to my heart and be ready to\nassist national, regional and international efforts,\nespecially in the areas of poverty eradication, people\nwith disabilities, food production and infrastructure\ndevelopment.\nAt the beginning of my statement, I referred to\nthe launch of the African Union, NEPAD and Africa\u00eds\nresolve to pursue a new beginning. I now want to add\nanother crucial dimension, that of gender equality and\nthe empowerment of women in decision-making and\ntheir election to national, regional and international\ninstitutions.\nOur subregional organization, the Southern\nAfrican Development Community, spearheaded this\nnew thinking, and we are happy that the African Union\nhas also started implementing this progressive and\nforward-looking agenda.\nThe recent inauguration of the Pan-African\nParliament, which is hosted by South Africa, is a\nlitmus test for Africa\u00eds renewal. We must not delay or\nfail in our joint venture to achieve the total integration\nof our continent.\nThe recognition and the full participation of\nwomen in decision-making are fundamental to Africa\u00eds\ntransformation and industrialization. With that in mind,\nwe proudly acknowledge the election of Mrs. Gertrude\nMongella of Tanzania, who became the first President\nof the Pan-African Parliament. There is no shortage of\ncompetent and experienced African women to lead the\nway forward. The African Union Commission includes\nfemale commissioners from various African countries.\nAfrica must place at the top of its agenda the\ninvolvement and support of women as leaders and role\nmodels.\nSince the days of the Organization of African\nUnity, the United Nations and Africa have been true\npartners. In the process, they have offered one another\nmutual support and ever increasing cooperation in the\nvital fields of conflict resolution, peace-building,\nhumanitarian relief and social development. Now that\nthe African Union has established its Peace and\nSecurity Council, in addition to NEPAD, we envisage a\nwider scope for cooperation and resource mobilization\nto plan for the prevention of armed conflicts and\nhuman suffering in Africa.\nWith the attainment of sustained peace and\nstability, Africa\u00eds economic growth and poverty\neradication will become a reality and the hopes and\naspirations of our people will be realized. To that end,\n9\n\nwe need continued and strong partnership with the\nUnited Nations.\nFrom this podium and in various other forums,\nwe have reaffirmed our belief in a peaceful,\ndemocratic, transparent and just international system.\nWe have advocated a system that would bring the poor\nand the rich of the world together to save the lives of\nmillions and pursue sustainable development and\nhuman security.\nTo achieve that noble objective, the United\nNations, in particular the Security Council, cannot\ncontinue operating on the basis of undemocratic\nstructures of decision-making. The Council should be\nreformed without delay; political will is what is\nlacking. We can do better. Now is the time. Africa\nneeds its place as a key player in this world body. We\ndemand our share of responsibility.\nThe current war in Iraq has divided the world,\ncausing enormous human suffering and undermining\ninternational peace and security. There is widespread\ndistrust among nations, and the danger of nuclear\nproliferation makes the situation even more alarming.\nMillions of people in Africa, especially in the\nGreat Lakes region and the Sudan, continue to\nexperience untold suffering due to conflict and war.\nNamibia is deeply concerned about the killings and the\nhuman rights violations against innocent women,\nchildren and the elderly in the Darfur region of the\nSudan. We call on all parties concerned, in particular\nthe Government of the Sudan, to implement without\ndelay all the agreements and commitments they have\nmade.\nAgainst that background, my Government fully\nsupports Security Council resolution 1564 (2004) of\n18 September 2004. While we support the efforts of the\nAfrican Union to find a peaceful solution to that highly\nvolatile situation, we feel strongly that the Security\nCouncil should assume full responsibility in\naccordance with the Charter. This problem can be\nresolved only through a Security Council resolution\nestablishing a peacekeeping mission for Sudan, in\nparticular to deal with human suffering in Darfur. In\nthat context, as a product of the United Nations\nourselves, and in the light of our commitment to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\nNamibia is prepared to contribute a battalion to such a\nUnited Nations mission.\nThe United Nations Settlement Plan for Western\nSahara must be implemented immediately. Likewise,\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people must be\nrealized. We, the international community, owe it to\nthem.\nNamibia reiterates its call for the immediate and\nunconditional lifting of the United States embargo\nagainst Cuba in order to allow the people of the two\ncountries to coexist peacefully.\nThe global security situation is being further\nthreatened by the emergence of mercenaries, who\nundermine legitimate Governments. The African\ncontinent has not been spared by this ugly\nphenomenon, which should be condemned by the\ninternational community.\nThe United Nations is the ideal place for finding\nsolutions through multilateral negotiations and\ncompromise. The Secretary-General needs the\nunwavering support of all Member States in order to\nplay an effective role in the Middle East and Africa\nand in conflict situations around the world. Whether\nfighting poverty, HIV/AIDS or terrorism, the\ninternational community must act as one. We must stop\nhuman suffering and promote security and prosperity\nfor all.\nNamibia stands for peace, unity, stability and\nmutually beneficial economic partnership. Our\nConstitution is the primary guide we rely on in those\npursuits.\nMy Government is implementing Vision 2030\nand the successive national development plans in\nstages, with a view to further enhancing economic\ngrowth and improving the living conditions of our\npeople, including by transforming our villages into\nviable socio-economic participants. Poverty, education,\nhealth care, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, skills\ndevelopment, the empowerment of women, the\nprotection of children and assistance to people with\ndisabilities are among the urgent national priorities\ncovered in those people-centred government\ninterventions.\nWe carry them out in partnership with business,\nlabour and those representing civil society. Happily, the\ncompetent United Nations agencies and international\nexperts based in Namibia are working closely with my\nGovernment to bring prosperity and transformation to\nNamibia and the subregion. When we succeed, Africa\n10\n\nwill benefit and the world, too, will acknowledge the\nshared rewards of development partnerships.\nI conclude my statement in the confidence that,\nthrough the United Nations, humanity will triumph\nover the challenges that confront us today so that the\nfuture generations will live in peace, free from the\nscourges of war, poverty, hunger and disease. I believe\nstrongly that our common goals and objectives are\nachievable because a people united, striving to achieve\na common good for all members of society, will always\nemerge victorious. Long live the United Nations!"

        "file_text": "An\noverall and realistic review of the current developments\nin international relations reveals that our world today\nfaces the formidable challenge of extremism.\nExtremism has two distinct and yet\ninterconnected faces: the violence and terrorism of\nnon-State actors and the unbridled militarism of States.\nThe former leads to increasing insecurity and the latter\nto increasing lawlessness. Insecurity is manifested in\nhorrendous acts of extreme violence and terrorism,\nwhether it is in Iraq, Afghanistan or Russia.\nLawlessness is manifested in acting outside of\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter and\nrelying on the glorification of force and the blatant use\nof military might. Lawless militarism of the powerful\nhas given rise to increasing violence and terrorism and\nis also marketed as their panacea. We must be\nrelentless against the former in a truly collective and\nall-inclusive manner, and we will muster the courage\nand national discipline to guard against the latter and\nremain within the confines of international law.\nThe increasing insecurity and escalation of acts\nof violence and terrorism in different parts of the world\nare a matter of serious concern to all of us. The recent\ntragic incidents in Iraq, in the school in Beslan in the\nRussian Federation\u2019s North Ossetia, and State terrorism\nin occupied Palestine have shocked and outraged all\npeoples worldwide. No rationale can justify the killing\nof children and the innocent.\nAs terrorism has become an international\nchallenge, an effective fight against it requires a global\napproach based on collective cooperation under the\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter as well as the\nprinciples of international law. We must rise above\nbusiness-as-usual politics and avoid discrimination,\ndouble standards and selectivity in our approach to\nfighting this global menace. As a victim of terrorism,\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and we\nhave demonstrated our strong commitment to fighting\nterrorism by the arrest and handover of the greatest\nnumber of Al Qaeda members apprehended by any\nsingle State to date. Our commitment fighting terrorism\nis unwavering. However, the prevailing international\napproach, which is primarily a law and order approach,\nis clearly failing to curb terrorism. We need to revisit our\npremises and try to develop a genuinely collective,\ninclusive, well-rounded and multidisciplinary approach,\nif we are serious about this fight. No State can even\ncome close to doing it alone.\nThe increasing lawless militarism, the second\nface of the challenge we encounter, is the use of brute\nand unsanctioned military force to achieve some\npolitical goals, albeit desirable goals. A clear example\nof this lawlessness is the attack against Iraq. The attack\n33\n\nagainst Iraq was illegal. I wish to thank our\ndistinguished Secretary-General for making this\nstatement a few days ego and courageously defending\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the rule of law. If\nwe, in this body, do not collectively defend the rule of\nlaw, we have helped to send the United Nations Charter\nto oblivion, thereby serving domination and militarism.\nWe in Iran benefited greatly by the removal of\nSaddam Hussein. Many in Iran are joyous to see the\nmurderer of their sons behind bars. However, as a\nmatter of principle, and as a principle of the United\nNations Charter, this cannot be regarded as anything\nbut the fruit of the forbidden tree. The international\ncommunity has demonstrated that it will not celebrate\nachieving this desirable goal through the illegal means\nof glorifying military power and rushing to use force\nwithout the approval of the United Nations.\nThe increasing lawlessness of States constitutes\neven a greater danger to our security. It undermines our\ncollective ability to contain terrorism and violence. It\noffsets our efforts to promote justice, equality,\nfreedom, dignity and prosperity for all, because, if\ncontinued, it will lower everyone\u2019s quality of life and\ndevalue our humanity. The prevailing world realities\nillustrate that unbridled militarism and blind terrorism\nare mutually reinforcing. The international community\nmust work together to find a way to liberate itself from\nthis vicious cycle.\nIn this context, one particular area that requires\nresolute action by the international community is the\nexistence and proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. As the only victim of the unbridled use of\nthese weapons in recent years, Iran feels very strongly\nabout the absolute imperative of a collective and rule-\nbased multilateral campaign to eradicate all such\nweapons and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons as an interim measure. This must be done by\nthe universal application of disarmament and non-\nproliferation instruments in a comprehensive and non-\ndiscriminatory manner. The relevant multilateral\ninstruments must become truly universal and the rights\nand obligations of all must be scrupulously enforced.\nAccess to technology for peaceful purposes is the only\ntrue incentive for the universality of those instruments.\nAt the same time, the legitimate disarmament and non-\nproliferation concerns of the international community\nmust be addressed through transparency and the\nvigorous application of monitoring mechanisms. Iran\nhas always been prepared to contribute actively to that\nglobal effort. While we insist on our right to\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, we have left \u2014 and\nwill leave \u2014 no stone unturned in order to provide\nassurances of our peaceful intentions.\nIran has been in the forefront of efforts to\nestablish a zone free from weapons of mass destruction\nin the Middle East. This initiative, which has received\nthe repeated approval of this Assembly and the Security\nCouncil, has been systematically obstructed by Israel\u2019s\nintransigence and its rejection \u2014 regrettably, with\nimpunity \u2014 of all multilateral instruments. All countries\nof the region and beyond are unanimous in considering\nthe Israeli arsenal, including its weapons of mass\ndestruction, combined with its policy and record of\naggression and State terrorism, as the single greatest\nthreat to regional and global peace and security. Israel\ncannot hide these facts behind smoke screens. It is time\nfor the international community to show its resolve to\nmaintain the credibility of multilateral disarmament\ninstruments by taking action to compel Israel to\ncomply.\nNext year will mark the sixtieth anniversary of\nthe entry into force of the United Nations Charter. The\nnext General Assembly will receive the report of the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\nNow in the final stages of preparing its report, the\nPanel would be well-advised to go beyond the\ngenerally advertised perceptions of threats and\nchallenges, and to address the more fundamental\nmalady of our age \u2014 that is, violence and the\nglorification of military might. Obviously, the\nprescription that the Panel will provide will very much\ndepend on its own perception of threats.\nIn that context, the paradigm of Dialogue among\nCivilizations, presented by President Khatami of the\nIslamic Republic of Iran and warmly received by the\ninternational community, continues to provide the only\nvehicle to help promote mutual understanding and\nfacilitate cooperation among States in the pursuit of\npeace, tolerance, freedom and prosperity.\nIn 2005, coinciding with the sixtieth anniversary\nof the adoption of the United Nations Charter, the\nimplementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\namong Civilizations will be reviewed. Based on the\ninternational experience gained in the period from\n2001 through 2005, such a review can help the\ninternational community to further advance that\nparadigm as a long-term process towards promoting\n34\n\npeace, democracy and development \u2014 the real principles\nand objectives of the United Nations Charter.\nWe condemn all acts of violence and terrorism in\nIraq. We stress the need for promoting security and\npreserving the unity, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of Iraq, promoting democracy through\ndrafting a new constitution, holding free and fair\nelections as scheduled and accelerating the\nreconstruction of Iraq, as well as the speedy\nwithdrawal of foreign forces from that country.\nWe welcomed the formation and supported the\noperation of the Iraqi transitional government as a\npositive step towards the restoration of the Iraqi\npeople\u2019s sovereignty. We emphasize that the United\nNations has a pivotal role to play and substantial\nresponsibilities to discharge in the transitional period.\nWe also welcome the position of the United\nNations Secretary-General on the important role that\nthe neighbouring countries to Iraq can play in the\nrestoration of peace and stability in Iraq and in its\nreconstruction.\nIn the Palestinian lands, the world is witnessing,\nwith much regret and concern, the continued gross\nviolation of human rights and the Israeli policy of\noccupation and repression against the oppressed\nPalestinian people.\nA durable peace in Palestine will only be possible\nif it is based on justice and guarantees an end to the\noccupation of the Palestinian lands, restoration of the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, return of\nthe people of the Palestinian diaspora to their\nhomeland, participation of all in a democratic process\nand the establishment of a Palestinian State with Al-\nQuds Al-Sharif as its capital.\nWe are of the view that the enlightened\nPalestinian people are capable of independently\ndeciding their political and social affairs and we\nrespect their free decisions on the future of Palestine.\nWe welcome the valuable efforts by the\nGovernment of Afghanistan to consolidate peace,\nsecurity and stability in the country. In addition,\nholding fair and free presidential and legislative\nelections and establishing a broad-based representative\nand multi-ethnic government, will be vital steps in the\nprocess of democratization and reconstruction in\nAfghanistan.\nRealization of the Millennium Development\nGoals is inseparable from viable international peace\nand security. Otherwise the political, social, economic\nand cultural problems of our world will continue to\nincrease cumulatively, leaving us in a more desperate\nsituation. In our view, the only option available to us is\nto foster closer international cooperation under\ninternationally recognized rules and instruments in the\nlight of dialogue, justice and democracy."

        "file_text": "I wish to greet you all and\nexpress my great pleasure at having this opportunity to\naddress this Assembly. I also wish to thank the United\nNations, once again, for everything it has done and is\ndoing for my country. Specifically, I would like to\nstress the importance of giving support to the returnees\nwho were expelled from their homes.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a multi-ethnic country\nin which Bosnian Muslims, Orthodox Serbs, Catholic\nCroats, Jews and many other ethnicities lived in peace\nand tolerance for hundreds of years. In Sarajevo and in\nmost other Bosnian towns, one can find mosques,\nOrthodox and Catholic churches and Jewish temples\nthat have stood side by side for hundreds of years. For\nthis reason, Sarajevo is called the Jerusalem of Europe.\nPreserving the multi-ethnic structure of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, with all its characteristics and\ndiversities, presents an historic challenge, not only to\nEurope, but to the whole world. Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is the foremost meeting point of world\ncultures and religions. It therefore refutes the theory of\nthe clash of civilizations.\nI would like to update you on the situation in my\ncountry, which has made significant progress over the\nlast nine years.\nThe infrastructure destroyed in the war has been\nrebuilt and macroeconomic stability has been achieved,\nwith only 1 per cent inflation. The banking system has\nbeen consolidated and foreign debts are being paid off.\nSince the post-war period, the gross domestic product\nhas increased three times over and national reserves\nhave increased 14 times over. Foreign currency\nreserves and savings are constantly increasing as well.\nWe are on the right path to meeting all the\nrequirements for starting negotiations with the\nEuropean Union (EU) on stabilization and association\nagreements. Due to the Republika Srpska entity\u00eds\nfailure to cooperate with the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), we have\nbeen unable to gain Partnership for Peace membership,\nalthough we meet all of the requirements.\nStrong reforms are under way in the areas of\neducation, customs, taxes, security and the defence\n2\n\nsystem. Many new central institutions have been set\nup, such as the Defence and Security Ministry, the\nintelligence service, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint\nMilitary Command and others. Compared with the\napproximately 500,000 soldiers of the three separate\narmies in 1995, the Bosnia and Herzegovina military\nforces now have 12,000 soldiers. The North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) had some 70,000 soldiers\nin Bosnia in 1996, and the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\nnow has about 7,000. The security situation is stable;\nthe peace has never been broken. Since the Dayton\nPeace Accords were signed, not a single foreign soldier\nhas been killed in Bosnia. Instead of being a consumer\nof international aid, Bosnia and Herzegovina is\nincreasingly becoming a participant in international\npeace missions, such as those in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Liberia,\nTimor-Leste, Haiti and others.\nThe common foreign, security and defence\npolicies of the European Union have enabled the EU to\ntake the leading role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By\nthe end of this year, EU military forces will take over\nfrom SFOR in Bosnia.\nThe positive stabilization process - as well as\nthe overall progress made not only in Bosnia, but also\nin the other countries created after the dissolution of\nthe former Yugoslavia - is being slowed down by an\ninappropriate attitude towards war crimes and war\ncriminals. Some public and political officials are trying\nto find an excuse for the war crimes, saying they were\ncommitted in the interest of vital ethnic protection. Yet\nwar criminals are treated as national heroes. This must\nbe changed. Only on the basis of truth and justice can\nwe build confidence and reconciliation among the\npeople and friendly relations among our respective\ncountries.\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the\nFormer Yugoslavia has an irreplaceable role to play in\nthat process. We deeply appreciate the work it has done\nso far. In our view, it must finish the trials that have\nalready begun, particularly those of the highest-level\nofficials. Some of the cases not yet completed can be\ntransferred only to courts of countries where the crimes\nhappened. This can be done only when those countries\nare prepared to guarantee fair and correct trials.\nFull cooperation with the ICTY must be an\nunavoidable requirement for accession to Euro-Atlantic\ninstitutions. Moreover, it is not enough to arrest and\nprosecute only war criminals on the ICTY's list. Local\ncourts in our respective countries must prosecute\nthousands of other war criminals who are still at large,\nwho constitute a destabilizing factor, who hinder\npositive processes, and who are often connected with\norganized crime.\nIn my country, we are going to establish within\nthe Bosnia and Herzegovina Court a war crimes\nchamber. The chamber will take over some of the\nHague Tribunal\u00eds cases, but it will also prosecute many\nother criminals. It is going to be The Hague in\nminiature. We will therefore need technical and\nfinancial support, and we will have to involve\ninternational judges and prosecutors with experience in\nsuch trials, above all those who have worked at The\nHague Tribunal.\nNext year will be the tenth anniversary of the\ngenocide against Bosnian Muslims in the United\nNations safe havens of Srebrenica and Zepa. The\npeople most responsible for that genocide, as well as\nfor all other war crimes committed in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina - Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\nMladic - have not yet been arrested. Those two men\nare responsible for the death of about 200,000 people.\nFrom this rostrum, I call on all in authority to arrest\nthem.\nThe outstanding issue of about 15,000 missing\npersons, whose bodies are spread among numerous\nmass graves throughout the country, 320 of which have\nbeen found so far in Bosnia, presents a big problem for\nmy country. We need help in finding the missing and\nidentifying them.\nThe political system set up by the Dayton and\nWashington Agreements played a positive role in\nestablishing peace, reconstruction and progress in my\ncountry. However, they are now increasingly becoming\nan obstacle to further development and progress. The\ncurrent administration in Bosnia, with a federation\ncomposed of 10 cantons, a republic and a district -\nstrong entities and a weak State - is an obstacle in our\nway towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It is an\nextremely complicated and expensive system that is\nbarely operational. The people, both in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and outside, are aware of this to varying\ndegrees.\nI believe the time is coming for domestic political\nrepresentatives to start to discuss the revision of\nBosnia's constitution and its compliance with\n3\n\ninternational conventions. We have to create an\nefficient State with institutions and mandates that will\nenable us to become a full member of the EU and\nNATO. I hope we will get support and help from\nfriendly countries and the international community as a\nwhole. A good opportunity for this will be next year,\nthe tenth anniversary of the signing of the Dayton\nPeace Accords. It is time for Bosnia to turn from the\nDayton phase to the Brussels phase.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is sincerely and firmly\ncommitted to strengthening friendly relations with the\nneighbouring Republic of Croatia and the State Union\nof Serbia and Montenegro on the basis of mutual\nrespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nequality. Our geographical location, history, ethnic\ncomposition and economic and infrastructure\nconnections are leading us towards overall cooperation.\nWe are aware that, without a resolution of disputed\nissues, we cannot proceed further to European\nintegration; we already have achieved some progress in\nthis regard.\nThe countries of South-Eastern Europe have\nmade huge individual and joint efforts to achieve great\nprogress in changing the stereotype of the region as a\nbackward, problematic and conflict-ridden area of the\nEuropean suburbs. Regional cooperation is being\npromoted in the areas of defence, security, border\ncontrol, free markets, visa regimes, combating\ncorruption and organized crime and the protection of\nethnic and religious minorities.\nThe issue of borders in the region cannot and\nmust not be opened again. We have to arrange such\nmatters in compliance with European standards.\nHowever, we have to open the issue of cooperation\nwith respect to borders, since it is in our common\ninterest.\nI think that the Iraqi crisis needs to be resolved\nsimultaneously with the Palestinian issue. We therefore\nsupport the initiative of the Quartet and the road map\nas a basis for setting up a sincere dialogue between the\ntwo States, with United States mediation. We also\nstrongly condemn all terrorist acts, as well as execution\nwithout trial of Palestinian religious leaders. We\nstrongly condemn the Israeli side's construction of the\nprotection wall.\nWe are happy with the consensus among Security\nCouncil members on the transfer of sovereignty from\ncoalition forces to the legitimately elected legal and\nexecutive authorities in Iraq. We think the United\nNations should take the leading role in shaping the\nfuture of Iraq. The Iraqi people need to govern their\nown country, and the military forces that control the\nterritory must respect the Geneva Conventions and\nhumanitarian law. The territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of Iraq must be preserved, including\nsovereignty over its natural resources. We call for\nprotection of Iraq's world heritage civilization and holy\nplaces, such as Karbala and the Imam Ali mosque in\nNajaf. With a view to helping the people of Iraq and\ncontributing to the establishment of peace there,\nBosnia and Herzegovina has sent a unit to Iraq to\ndestroy mines and unexploded devices.\nMy country is sincerely committed to combating\ninternational terrorism and is an active participant in\nthe international anti-terrorist coalition. Terrorism is\nnot only a threat to peace and security; in our view, it is\nimmoral and counterproductive. It is immoral because\ninnocent people are killed, and it is counterproductive\nbecause terrorism cannot resolve problems. It only\nproduces new ones. In that regard, I would like to\nhighlight here the example of Bosnian Muslims, since\nwe were the major victim of the aggression against\nBosnia between 1992 and 1995. We managed to defend\nourselves, but both during and after the war we never\nturned our hands to revenge or terrorism.\nAllow me to review the issue of Security Council\nreform, as well as that of strengthening the efficiency\nof the mechanisms of the United Nations. The citizens\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina know from their own\nexperience what a lack of proper and efficient United\nNations action can mean. If United Nations\nmechanisms were more efficient, the aggression\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have\nhappened or, at least, the war would not have been so\nlong. If they were more efficient, then genocide would\nnot have been committed in the United Nations safe\nhavens of Srebrenica and Zepa. For that reason, I want\nto remind everyone of the Organization\u00eds obligation to\nassist the survivors in those areas.\nWhen considering the situation in the world\ntoday, the question of efficient cooperation in the area\nof security is inevitably raised. The Security Council\nneeds to be the leading factor for peace and stability in\nthe world. It has to have at its disposal mechanisms\nthat can be operated with efficiency and speed in order\nto prevent conflicts from becoming military clashes.\n4\n\nAmong other proposals, we support the initiatives\nto enlarge the Security Council\u00eds membership.\nBosnia and Herzegovina wants to become a non-\npermanent member of the Security Council. In terms of\nSecurity Council efficiency, our experience has been\nmostly a negative one. Through our participation in the\nwork of the Council, we hope to prevent a repetition of\nour experience elsewhere in the world. Therefore, we\ntake this opportunity to confirm our intention of\nputting forth our candidature for the 2010-2011 term.\nBosnia and Herzegovina deserves that honour and we\nare determined to prove our worth."

        "file_text": "I am\npleased to convey my congratulations to the President\nelected to the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. I likewise take this opportunity to express\nour appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for the great efforts he has been exerting to\nrestructure and reform the United Nations, to improve\nits methods of work and revitalize its role in all fields\nin order to face the demands and challenges of the\ntwenty-first century.\nReform and restructuring of the United Nations\nsystem have become imperatives, since this world\nOrganization remains the ideal mechanism to address\nthe urgent problems of the world, by way of combating\npoverty and hunger, ensuring the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, achieving disarmament\nand resolving armed conflicts, combating diseases that\ntake the lives of millions, such as AIDS and malaria.\nThe United Nations has organized numerous\ninternational conferences and summits in the last 10\nyears, such as the Millennium Summit, the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg\nand the International Conference on Financing for\n50\n\nDevelopment in Monterrey to address those\nmultilateral problems. The international community\nmay not have been able to achieve enough progress in\naddressing some of these issues, but this should not\nprevent us from redoubling our efforts to implement\nthe international treaties, resolutions and programmes\nof action of such United Nations conferences. This\nmust be done in order to ensure respect for the\npurposes and principles of the Charter, international\nlaw, the central role of the United Nations and its\nprimacy in preserving international peace and security\nand in the strengthening of international cooperation in\nthe economic, social and cultural spheres.\nTerrorism is one of the major challenges the\nUnited Nations faces in this millennium. Its negative\neffects are extremely serious and touch upon all States\nwithout exception, although to varying degrees.\nTerrorist attacks such as those of 11 September 2001,\nthe attacks against the brotherly kingdom of Saudi\nArabia and the events in Jakarta and Beslan emphasize\nthe fact that this phenomenon affects us all. Its targets are\nall peoples of the world, not any one State in particular.\nWe must, therefore, cooperate fully and\ncollectively in addressing the roots of terrorism and not\nsimply deal with its tragic effects. Kuwait has endorsed\nall of the United Nations resolutions to combat\nterrorism. Terrorism, however, is not related to any one\nethnic group, culture or religion. It is an international\nphenomenon that must be addressed by the United\nNations, as the ideal framework for diagnosing its\ncauses and arriving at the necessary solutions needed\nto contain it.\nA year and a half after the fall of Saddam\nHussein\u00eds dictatorship, the situation in Iraq continues\nto be a delicate one of uncertainty and insecurity, due\nto terrorist acts carried out by armed groups and the\nremnants of the old regime. This is hampering the\nefforts of the interim Iraqi Government, which is\nendeavouring to rebuild what the old regime destroyed\nthrough its policy of aggression.\nConvinced as we are that security and stability in\nIraq mean security for the region as a whole, Kuwait\nsupports the efforts of the Iraqis to rebuild their\ncountry in these difficult times, so that Iraq may\nresume its positive international and regional roles. We\nare sure that the Iraqi people will be able to do this. In\nthat regard, we support Security Council resolution\n1546 (2004), which supports the effort that everyone\nwishes to see, namely, the preservation of Iraq\u00eds\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and unity. Kuwait\nsupports the interim Government of Iraq, which is\nexpressing the will of the Iraqi people to build a\ntolerant Iraq that cares about peace, based upon\ndemocracy, the building of constitutional institutions\nand respect for and pursuit of its internal political\nprocess, which would be embodied in the\nestablishment of the Iraqi National Congress that\nwould build such institutions, formulate a new\nconstitution, and conduct new and free elections.\nKuwait aspires to strong brotherly relations with the\nnew, free Iraq, based on mutual respect, good\nneighbourliness, respect for bilateral agreements and\nresolutions under international law.\nWe welcome, likewise, the creation of a tribunal\nfor former military officers responsible for crimes\nagainst the Iraqi people and the people of Kuwait\ncommitted during the invasion of Kuwait, as well as\nfor the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and third-\ncountry persons.\nWe express our appreciation to the United\nNations and international and regional organizations \u00f3\nsuch as the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization\nof the Islamic Conference, the League of Arab States\nand the Gulf Cooperation Council \u00f3 for their support\nand their condemnation of the old regime, which killed\nprisoners of war and concealed that crime for more\nthan a decade in flagrant violation of international\nhumanitarian law. We also thank the interim\nGovernment, which is seeking to investigate what has\nhappened to those prisoners of war.\nWe are following with great concern the tragic\nsituation faced by the Palestinian people in the occupied\nArab territories as a result of Israeli policies and practices\nthat contravene international and humanitarian law.\nWe reaffirm our support to the struggle of the\nPalestinian people and their legitimate claim to recover\ntheir political rights. We therefore call upon Israel to\nrespect Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973), and 1515 (2003), the principle of land for\npeace, the road map and the dismantling of the racial\nseparation wall. That is part of our integral vision for\nresolving the situation in the Middle East, which must\nbe based on mutual respect and cooperation between\nall parties.\nTo ensure stability in the Middle East, we must\nalso work to eradicate weapons of mass destruction,\n51\n\nand all parties need to pursue the path of understanding\nand dialogue to implement the noble principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations governing inter-State\nrelations and relations among the peoples of the world.\nWe reiterate, in that regard, that the dispute between\nthe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of\nIran concerning the three islands that belong to the\nEmirates should be resolved by peaceful means. We\nurge the two parties to resolve that dispute as rapidly as\npossible.\nRegarding Darfur, we are all concerned about the\nhumanitarian tragedy there. We believe that the Sudan\nis striving to find a reasonable solution to that\nhumanitarian dilemma.\nKuwait is pursuing international and regional\nefforts to achieve peace and security in both\nAfghanistan and Somalia, which for many years have\nsuffered from a lack of authority and the deterioration\nof their economic and political situation owing to the\nconflicts between various local forces and factions. We\nsupport the good offices of the United Nations and\nregional organizations that have made progress\npossible at the political level. We hope that those\nefforts will continue so that national reconciliation in\nthose brotherly nations can be achieved.\nThe information revolution and the vast\ntechnological progress in the areas of trade and\ncommunications have brought about interdependence.\nThe world has become a little village, every corner of\nwhich can now be reached. Many States, and\ndeveloping countries in particular, have therefore\nundergone fundamental changes in their economic\nframework in order to take advantage of the\nphenomenon of economic globablization and ensure\nprogress and development for their peoples. Despite\nthe benefits of those policies, such as the liberalization\nof international trade and the lowering of tariff\nbarriers, many countries, especially the least developed\namong them, are suffering from marginalization and\nmany aggravated social problems, such as poverty,\nhunger and the spread of diseases resulting from the\ndeterioration of their economies. For that reason, we\ncall upon the international financial institutions, and\nthe World Trade Organization in particular, to give\nspecial attention to the developing countries and to\nconsider providing financial support to improve their\neconomic and social situations. We call upon the\ndeveloped countries to increase their development\nassistance, to open access to their markets, and to\nreduce the debt burden of the developing countries so\nthat they are able to strengthen their economic\ninfrastructure.\nKuwait continues to support development\nprojects in many developing countries through regional\nand international institutions and organizations, as well\nas through the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic\nDevelopment, which we had the honour of establishing\nover four decades ago and through which we have\nprovided more than $11 billion to over 100 countries.\nAt the Millennium Summit our leaders laid out\nthe paths to be followed and goals to be attained. Let us\nwork together to achieve a better future for all peoples."

        "file_text": "It is with\npleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the presidency at the fifty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly.\nIt is also a pleasure to speak to the Assembly\ntoday as the Prime Minister of a fully sovereign State\nthat seeks to recover its place among the community of\nnations. Iraq has been isolated from the international\ncommunity for a very long time. It was deprived of the\nvery important role it should play in the community of\nnations. The Iraqi people aspire to recover that role\ntoday.\nIraq is a nation rich in cultural heritage and\nhistory, as the cradle of civilization. But the oppressive\nregime of Saddam Hussein cast a long, sinister shadow\nover Iraq. It traumatized and suppressed the people of\nIraq for decades. With the fall of Saddam Hussein\u2019s\n11\n\noppressive regime, our country and the world have\nbeen made safer. New horizons for fruitful and\nconstructive cooperation with the world have emerged.\nA new situation has emerged in Iraq, which is\nnow experiencing a conflict of far-reaching\nconsequences for the country\u2019s future and its relations\nwith the world. It is the struggle of the Iraqi people \u2014\nand its vision for future peace and democracy \u2014\nagainst the terrorists and extremists and the remnants\nof Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, who are targeting that\nnoble dream long nurtured by our people. It is the\nstruggle of all civilized nations against those working\nto destroy civilization and world culture. I therefore\nappeal to the representatives of the countries assembled\nhere to help Iraq to defeat the forces of terrorism and to\nbuild a better future for its people.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nThe brutal dictatorship imposed by Saddam\nHussein on Iraq brought destruction to Iraq and\nbrutalized and traumatized the Iraqi people. The regime\nkilled hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens. It\narrested and tortured many thousands more and drove\nmillions of Iraqis to leave their country after depriving\nthem of the most fundamental human and civil rights.\nIt also ruined relations among Iraqis by sowing the\nseeds of religious, ethnic and other divisions.\nMy words today cannot adequately convey the\noppression and suffering endured by the Iraqi people\nover three decades. We have discovered 262 mass\ngraves, and we continue to find more; they prove the\ncorruption of the Saddam regime and its lack of\ncompassion and respect for life.\nDuring the brutal era of Saddam Hussein, the\ndream of the Iraqi people was to build a democratic,\nfederal and free Iraq that would ensure a dignified life\nfor its citizens. Today, we have a genuine opportunity\nto make that dream come true. Iraq has now become a\ncountry of laws that ensure respect for human rights\nand freedoms. It has a Government that embodies the\ndiversity of the Iraqi people within the framework of\ngenuine national unity.\nToday, we are also preparing to hold democratic\nelections next January under the timeline set in the\nLaw of Administration of the State of Iraq for the\nTransitional Period and in Security Council resolution\n1546 (2004). We are committed to that timeline despite\nthe complexities and difficulties involved, and, with\nthe Assembly\u2019s help, we can meet the deadline.\nHolding elections is a vital and necessary step towards\nimproving the security situation in Iraq. We hope that\nall Iraqis will participate in the elections and contribute\nto the completion of the political process.\nNonetheless, there is a tiny extremist minority\nthat seeks to deprive Iraqis of the opportunity to fulfil\ntheir dream of building a democratic future in Iraq.\nLike all terrorists everywhere in the world, those who\nare responsible for terrorism in Iraq hate democracy,\nfreedom and humanity. They are abetted in their\ncriminal endeavours by a number of foreigners who\nhave infiltrated Iraq from neighbouring countries.\nThere are also criminals from the previous regime, who\naim at destroying our country and impeding progress.\nThey are not freedom fighters, as is claimed by some\nbiased circles. They do not mean to liberate our\ncountry; rather, they want to spread chaos, violence\nand terror and jeopardize the security of citizens and of\nthe country. They target the dreams and aspirations of\nthe Iraqi people.\nIn fact, our goal in the ongoing conflict is to\nrestore stability and the rule of law and to enable the\nmen, women and children of Iraq to live free from fear.\nThe aim of the terrorists, on the other hand, is to\ndestroy the aspirations and will power of our people\nthrough mass killings and the destruction of Iraq\u2019s\ninfrastructure, and to stop economic life in Iraq and\ncreate a state of tension, panic and instability in order\nto undermine peace and security. They want to destroy\nhuman civilization in our region and, indeed,\nthroughout the world.\nFor all those reasons, my Government\u2019s top\npriorities are to defeat the terrorists\u2019 schemes, to\nestablish security throughout Iraq and to hunt down the\nterrorists and bring them to justice. We have developed\nplans to promote security as a vital precondition for the\nreconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of economic\nprogress, the completion of the political process, the\nachievement of national reconciliation and the\npromotion of a culture of tolerance among all citizens\nof Iraq.\nPerhaps members now appreciate the daunting\ntask we are facing. We look forward to assistance from\nour neighbours and all of our friends in the\ninternational community in order to achieve security\nand stability in Iraq. I recognize that some countries\nhere objected to the war that brought down the\n12\n\noppressive regime of Saddam Hussein and liberated the\npeople of Iraq. And that is their right. However,\ndifferences over this issue should not remain an\nobstacle to establishing new cooperative relationships\nthat would allow Iraq to receive serious international\nsupport to consolidate security, freedom and\ndemocracy in our country and to forge ahead on the\npath of development and progress.\nIraq welcomes international support for the\nobjectives of the Iraqi people as outlined in Security\nCouncil resolution 1546 (2004), which was adopted\nunanimously. That resolution reaffirms the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of Iraq and endorses the\nformation of the national Government. It also affirms\nthe international community\u2019s commitment to support\nthe Government in fulfilling the will of the Iraqi people\nby holding elections and establishing the proper legal\nframework for political parties and civil society. In\naddition, it places emphasis on the re-establishment of\nan effective governmental structure, the application of\nthe principle of social justice, and the promotion of a\nclimate of tolerance, dialogue and human rights.\nWe need more assistance from our neighbours\nand from the international community as a whole to\nmeet all those objectives and to translate the\naspirations of the Iraqi people into realities after so\nmany decades of suffering under the oppression of the\nprevious regime and its excessive practices. We are\nproud of our membership of the League of Arab States,\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and\nwe have started a fruitful dialogue with the European\nUnion. We hope that all that will lead to concrete\npositive results in the near future.\nAlso, I am pleased to announce here that the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreed\nto assist Iraq in the training of its security forces. I\nespecially welcome the upcoming conference of\nneighbouring countries and other friendly countries,\nwith the objective of empowering the Iraqi people to\nface its challenges and dangers and of establishing\nstability in Iraq.\nIt is our duty to coordinate our efforts in the fight\nagainst terrorism and to exchange information. It is\nalso our duty to ensure that our national borders are\nmore secure, so that we can halt the infiltration of\nterrorists into Iraq and put an end to their destructive\nactivities. In that context, we call upon all friendly and\npeace-loving nations to stand by Iraq; we need their\nimmediate assistance. We need more assistance from\nthe multinational force, and we need a broadening of\nthe base of countries contributing troops to that force,\nso that it will be better equipped and more determined\nto confront terrorism and to provide security protection\nfor the United Nations and its agencies when they\nreturn to Iraq.\nMy Government is committed to the\nreconstruction and development of the national\neconomy and is working with the World Bank, the\nUnited Nations system and the International Monetary\nFund to complete the reforms under way and enhance\nIraq\u2019s prospects for welfare and prosperity, so that it\ncan become effective as a trading partner of other\nnations. The problem of foreign debt has emerged as\nthe most serious obstacle on that road. Our debts\namount to billions of dollars, which is beyond our\ncapacity to repay. This places an unjust burden on the\nIraqi people, since those debts arose from the\nprohibitive costs improperly incurred by the former\nregime in its unjustified wars, its support for\ninternational terrorism, its acquisition of weapons of\nmass destruction and its plunder of our national\nresources.\nWith good intentions and rational management,\nIraq hopes to reach agreement with the Paris Club by\nthe end of this year in order to achieve substantial\nreductions in our debts. Here, I would like to express\nour gratitude to those countries that have decided to\nwrite off their loans to Iraq, and I appeal to other\ncreditor nations to show the same generosity. Without\ntheir assistance, we will not be able to reconstruct Iraq\nand attract the foreign investment that would enhance\nour ability to defeat terrorism and improve security for\nthe Iraqi people, ensuring increased economic benefits\nfor the region and entire world. Also, I appeal to donor\ncountries that have pledged generous financial\nassistance to fulfil their obligations in order to help us\nreconstruct our country. We welcome the meeting of\ndonor countries scheduled to be convened next month\nin Tokyo. Such financial assistance will create an\natmosphere of optimism that will allow us to leave the\npast totally behind and will help us finance reforms and\ndevelopment projects on the ground. In addition, we\nhope that Iraq\u2019s friends will provide financial\nassistance to ensure the success of our democratic\nelections.\n13\n\nWe seek international assistance from the United\nNations for the special Iraqi court in order to ensure\nthat all defendants, whatever serious crimes they may\nbe charged with, receive fair trials within the justice\nsystem. That would help Iraq free itself from the\npernicious shackles of the past.\nWe stress that the efforts and resources\ncommitted by the international community to promote\nIraq\u2019s democracy and revive its economy shall not have\nbeen committed in vain. They may even have a\npositive impact on the entire region and the world as a\nwhole, creating a climate conducive to peace, security\nand international and regional cooperation on the basis\nof respect for mutual interests.\nWe highly appreciate the role and good offices of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in helping us lay the\nfoundations of freedom and democracy. We also pay\ntribute to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, former Personal Envoy\nof the Secretary-General, for his work on the\nconstitution of the interim Iraqi Government. We also\nwelcome the appointment of Mr. Ashraf Qazi as\nMr. Brahimi\u2019s successor. We further welcome the\nassistance team dispatched by the United Nations to\nhelp us meet our obligation to convene general\nelections in January.\nWe look forward to welcoming United Nations\npersonnel in Iraq to help see us through an effective\npolitical process and reconstruction. We warmly look\nforward to the return of all United Nations agencies to\nfulfil their noble mission in Iraq.\nOn this occasion, I wish to recall with deep\nanguish and sorrow the destruction of the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad just over a year ago\nin a brutal and barbaric terrorist attack that claimed the\nlives of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, a brilliant\ninternational figure, and of other United Nations staff\nmembers in the international compound. Their memory\nwill remain a vivid testimony for the promotion of\ndemocracy and stability in Iraq. I stress our\ndetermination to defeat the cowardly terrorists who\ntarget the lives of foreign workers who come to Iraq to\nhelp us fulfil our noble mission.\nIraq follows closely the challenges that face the\ncountries of the world, including the emergence of new\nforms of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, the need to reduce poverty, the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals,\nrespect for human rights and the consolidation of\ndemocracy and equality. In that regard, Iraq appeals to\nthe United Nations in particular to strive even harder,\nto combat and eradicate the horrendous scourge of\nterrorism. That struggle calls for new ideas and firmer\nresolve to implement the existing agreements. It is\nimportant that we affirm the commitment of the\nGovernment and people of Iraq to succeed in this\nbattle.\nTerrorism is a disease that is spreading\nthroughout the world, employing misleading slogans.\nTerrorists have killed numerous people in the name of\nIslam in New York, Turkey, the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia, Bali, Madrid, Baghdad and elsewhere. They\nare criminals who commit their evil acts without mercy\nand evince only a taste for barbarism and bloodshed.\nToday, they have chosen Iraq as their battleground\nbecause they fear the success of the Iraqi experience\nand the restoration of Iraq\u2019s stability, development and\ndemocratic institution-building. They will reap nothing\nbut failure and total defeat.\nThus, our struggle is the United Nations struggle,\nour victory will be its victory and our defeat will be its\ndefeat. Indeed, the values of democracy, freedom,\njustice and equality for all, irrespective of gender,\ncolour, faith or race, are common human values. There\nis no room or excuse for those who seek to divide our\nworld by making a distinction of Muslims, which is\nextremely damaging to the unity of human society,\npeace and security.\nFurthermore, we believe in the importance of\nconsolidating peace and stability in the Middle East on\nthe basis of United Nations resolutions, of respect for\nmutual rights and of a just and comprehensive peace.\nLet me appeal today before the international\ncommunity, both to those who supported the war in\nIraq and to those who opposed it, as well as to the\nUnited Nations itself, not to remain neutral or idle in\nthe struggle, but to join us for our sake as well as for\ntheir own. The fulfilment of the Iraqi people\u2019s dream of\na free, stable and prosperous Iraq, with good standing\nin the family of peace-loving nations, will strengthen\nour capacity and resolve to achieve justice and peace,\nto defeat terrorism and violence, and to end all forms\nof division and hatred among nations. Let us stand side\nby side as one international family in order to achieve\nour noble cause."

        "file_text": "I would like first to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. You have an important and challenging task\nahead. In executing your duties you can be assured of\nmy full support and that of the Maltese delegation.\nI take this opportunity to express our appreciation\nto the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\neighth session, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte. Over\nthe last twelve months he has successfully guided the\nAssembly\u00eds work with exemplary dedication and\ninitiative.\nI would also like, at the outset of my intervention\nthis afternoon, to take the opportunity to express the\nsolidarity of the Maltese people with those countries\nand people who have suffered loss of life and damage\nto property as a result of the recent spate of hurricanes\nand tropical storms, particularly the people of Haiti.\nWe, the Maltese people, pledge our support in this hour\nof need.\nIt is a source of particular satisfaction for me to\naddress the Assembly for the first time as Prime\nMinister of Malta, and also for Malta in its new role as\na member of the European Union. The President of the\nUnion\u00eds Council of Ministers, the Foreign Minister of\nthe Netherlands, has already laid before the Assembly\nthe objectives and priorities of the 25 members of the\nUnion for the coming months.\nThe upholding and development of international\nlaw and effective multilateralism are central to the\nEuropean Union\u00eds external actions. The role of the\nUnited Nations is vital in this regard. Malta has\nconsistently supported the view that the international\ncommunity needs this universal forum within which it\ncan collectively deliberate and act upon the many\nproblems that confront it. Our membership in the\nEuropean Union gives renewed scope and added\ndimension to our commitment to the United Nations\nand its role in international affairs.\nRecent events have raised urgent questions about\nthe extent to which the United Nations is fulfilling the\nrole envisaged for it under the Charter. Inevitably this\nleads to some serious concerns about the effectiveness\nof our Organization. Nevertheless, the questions which\nhave been raised do not diminish the case not only for\nits continued existence but also for its strengthening as\na world body. As we survey the latest developments in\ncrises spots around the globe, the realization intensifies\nthat solutions to the major problems of our age are\nbeyond the grasp and control of any single nation or\nparticular group of nations, however powerful and\ndetermined.\nThe international system is itself frequently\noverwhelmed by the immensity and complexity of many\nof the problems it faces. The United Nations is indeed at\nthe forefront of action in the most critical areas -\nfurthering development, relieving suffering, safeguarding\nhuman rights, combating terrorism, fighting\nenvironmental degradation, fostering sustainability,\nresolving conflicts, promoting peace and disarmament\nand upholding the rule of international law.\nEach year we derive a measure of comfort from\nthe knowledge that some progress is being recorded in\ncertain areas. In this year\u00eds report the Secretary-\nGeneral mentions last July\u00eds Framework Agreement\nthat put the Doha Round of trade negotiations back on\ntrack; he refers to the contribution that United Nations\npeace missions are making towards the gradual\nimprovement of the situation in Liberia, Sierra Leone,\nSomalia and the Central African Republic, as well as in\nAfghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Guatemala and Haiti.\nHe records the launching of an important new\nprogramme in the fight against HIV/AIDS; he notes\nthat for the second consecutive year the global refugee\nfigure has decreased by nearly 1 million, and he\nbelieves that meeting the Millennium Development\nGoals by the target date of 2015 remains achievable.\nAt the same time, however, the Secretary-General\nhighlights a bewildering array of areas on which no\nvisible progress can be registered, in spite of the fact\nthat, as the Secretary-General reminds us, there are at\npresent more than 56,000 uniformed personnel and\nsome 11,000 civilian staff from 97 countries serving in\n16 United Nations missions worldwide, and in spite of\nthe fact that the whole United Nations system,\nincluding the specialized agencies, is wholeheartedly\nengaged in the work of promoting economic and social\nprogress and development.\nThe humanitarian crisis in Darfur, in western\nSudan, is one stark manifestation of an apparently\nunbridgeable gap between intention and execution. The\ndaily visions on television screens throughout the\nworld of thousands of refugees suffering and dying\n15\n\noverwhelm the impact that a steady but slow\ndiplomacy may be making in its own right. In Iraq, in\nPalestine and in Israel, the fact that in those difficult\nrealities hardly a single day goes by without news of\npeople dying violently in armed actions is in sharp\ncontrast with the limited reports on continuing efforts\nto find peaceful and viable solutions. Silently, across\nour globe of plenty with its advanced technology, the\nfact remains that in spite of our collective efforts\nmillions of individuals, many of them children,\ncontinue to suffer and die in conditions of absolute\npoverty, malnutrition and disease.\nOver the next 12 months two events will provide\na special opportunity for the United Nations\nmembership to focus on the key issues that challenge\nthe vitality and effectiveness of our Organization. The\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change,\nappointed by the Secretary-General last year, will soon\nproduce its report. The Secretary-General expects that\nthe Panel, after examining the threats we face and\nevaluating our existing policies, processes and\ninstitutions, will make bold and practicable\nrecommendations. It will be up to us as Member States,\ncollectively and individually, to be equally bold and\npractical in responding to those recommendations.\nThe Panel\u00eds report will be followed in 2005 by a\nhigh-level meeting on the five-year review of the\nMillennium Declaration, as well as the commemoration\nof the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Five\nyears after what was expected to be the dawn of a new\nera, the time will be ripe for some dramatic results to\nemerge, not least at the institutional level.\nHigh on the agenda in this context is the reform\nof the Security Council. As currently constituted, the\nCouncil suffers from three noticeable weaknesses.\nFirst, it has limited means of adequately addressing the\ndevelopment issues involved in security matters.\nSecondly, the regional distribution of authority in the\nCouncil is severely lopsided. And, thirdly, the great\nmajority of Member States, especially the smaller ones,\nare underrepresented in the deliberations of the\nCouncil. Urgent remedies need to be found for all these\nweaknesses for the Council to be able to continue to\nplay a relevant role in the twenty-first century.\nIn its turn, the General Assembly needs to greatly\nintensify current efforts to enhance the strengths\ninherent in its universality, while discarding the\ndebilitating and time-consuming procedures and\nworking methods that such universality has bred. The\nmajor organs and specialized agencies of the United\nNations system also need to devise improved ways of\nharmonizing, through the Economic and Social Council,\ntheir many impressive, but often disparate, efforts to\nfoster sustainable social and economic development.\nOne of the underlying strengths of the United\nNations system lies in the manner in which it permits\naction at the regional level to insert itself into global\nefforts towards peace, security and cooperation. In recent\nyears, the progressive strengthening of the African Union\nhas added a welcome partner to the regional framework,\nin what is, unfortunately, the region of greatest need.\nThe recently enlarged European Union has also\nbeen progressively enhancing its cooperation with the\nUnited Nations at both the regional and higher levels.\nThe Secretary-General refers in his report on the work\nof the Organization (A/59/1) to the significant progress in\nEU/United Nations cooperation on conflict prevention,\npeace-building and post-conflict reconstruction, as well\nas in crisis management activities.\nOne area in which the EU and the United Nations\nare active and important partners concerns the question\nof Palestine. As members of the Quartet, the EU and\nthe United Nations play a significant role by injecting a\nmuch-needed balance and objectivity into an issue\ntormented by violence and passion. Both the EU and\nthe United Nations are by right major stakeholders in\nthe issue. History and geographical proximity underpin\nthe special interest of all EU member States in the\nprosperity and well-being of both Israelis and\nPalestinians. The creation and peaceful coexistence of\ntwo neighbouring States, Israel and Palestine, was one\nof the United Nations very first, but unfortunately still\nunfulfilled, recommendations.\nAfter decades of bitterness and wrong turns, the\nissue of Palestine remains jeopardized by the forces of\nextremism and intransigence. But extremism and\nintransigence \u00f3 as manifested by both the perpetrators\nof Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli advocates\nof a continuing and forceful military occupation of\nPalestinian territories - do have a counterbalance on\nboth sides, as manifested by the Geneva Initiative of\nlate last year, among many other examples. The EU\nand the United Nations need to continuously exert their\ninfluence and pressure on both sides to persuade them\nto give greater heed and credibility to the voices of\nreason which lie in their midst.\n16\n\nThe path to legality and reconciliation has been\ndefined in the road map, in the many resolutions of the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and, most\nrecently, in the advisory opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice. Even in the face of constant setbacks\non the ground, the EU and United Nations Quartet\npartners need to remain steadfast in their insistence\nthat the road to peace can only be set within those\nparameters.\nMalta looks at the problem both from its tragic\nhumanitarian dimension as well as from its far-\nreaching implications for peace and security. One\nimportant concern for us in that regard is the impact\nthat the problem has on issues of peace and security in\nthe Middle East in general and the Mediterranean area\nin particular.\nOne of the primary objectives of the European\nUnion is to promote the development, through\npartnership, of a common zone of peace, prosperity and\nprogress in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. In\nrecent months the Union has elaborated a policy\nagenda for that strategic partnership linking together a\nnumber of instruments and mechanisms that have been\nput in place over the years. The Euro-Mediterranean\nPartnership - the Barcelona or Euromed process - and\nthe European Neighbourhood Policy are the frameworks\nof that policy. A key element in the EU approach is the\nparallel importance assigned to the processes of\nsecurity-building and to cooperation in the social,\neconomic, cultural and humanitarian fields. In that way\nit ensures that the evolving relationships in the Euro-\nMediterranean area are tailored to the specific concerns\nand needs of the individual countries and regions.\nFor the Balkan region, the framework provided\nby the European Neighbourhood Policy \u00f3 and the\nprospect of consolidating relationships with the\nEuropean Union which it implies \u00f3 constitutes an\nimportant contributory factor towards growth and\nstability. With the exception of the situation in Kosovo,\nwhich remains disturbing, and some other examples,\nprogress in the Balkan region is encouraging.\nThe almost decade-long EuroMed process has\ngradually but steadily put into place a useful structure\nfor the strengthening and consolidation of relationships\namong the countries of the Mediterranean. It not only\ncontributes to the economic and social development of\nindividual countries, but also provides a stable\nbackground in which some of the wider problems may be\ntackled, taking into account the strong linkage that\nexists between security and cooperation in Europe and\nin the Mediterranean. It needs strengthening and\nbroadening, and in that context, the participation of\nLibya in the Barcelona Euromed process would be\nparticularly welcome.\nOne such issue concerns the question of\nmigration from the southern to the northern shores of\nthe Mediterranean. As in other parts of the world, that\nissue needs to be tackled from the economic, social and\npolitical, as well as the humanitarian, perspective.\nBecause of its geographical location and small size,\nMalta has a special sensitivity to the many problems\nand complexities of the issue. We are hopeful that the\nspirit of cooperation and understanding provided by the\nEuroMed process can help countries in our region to\nsuccessfully tackle the challenges involved.\nOver the last few months, an important\ndevelopment took place in our region in the context of\ndisarmament. Libya\u00eds decision to renounce its\nprogramme of weapons of mass destruction has been\nwelcomed by all. As a longstanding friend and close\nneighbour of Libya, Malta has particular reasons to\nwelcome this development and the increased\nopportunities it now creates for Libya to play a\nsignificant role in the process of Euro-Mediterranean\nsecurity and cooperation.\nIt is reasonable to argue that the framework of\nregional stability and cooperation provided by the\nEuro-Mediterranean process was one factor that\ncontributed to Libya\u00eds decision to renounce its\nprogramme. Nevertheless, problems relating to the\ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction still exist\nin other regions of the world. The role that can be\nplayed by initiatives encouraging regional stability and\neconomic and social development in the resolution of\nthese problems should not be underestimated.\nWe must also look at the problems raised by the\nthreat of new weapons of mass destruction as part of\nthe wider issue of disarmament in its many aspects.\nThe continuing commitment to the major multilateral\ntreaties and increased efforts to intensify measures of\nverification and compliance are of paramount importance\nin this regard. Equally important is the need to bring the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force\nwithout further delay.\nThe problem of the proliferation of weapons,\nespecially weapons of mass destruction, has in our day\n17\n\nassumed a new and frightening dimension in its\npossible linkage with terrorism. In this regard, as the\nSecretary-General points out, the effective\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540\n(2004), adopted earlier this year, should complement\nongoing efforts to strengthen existing multilateral and\nnon-proliferation regimes.\nThe fight against terrorism involves all of us and\nneeds to be pursued with firmness and tenacity. At the\nsame time, the struggle must take place on our terms\nand not those of the terrorists. As the Secretary-\nGeneral takes every opportunity to remind us, this\nstruggle must not take place at the expense of the\nfundamental freedoms and basic dignity of individuals,\nneither must we allow the legitimate concern to\neradicate terrorism in all its aspects to distract the\ncommitment of the global community in its endeavour\ntowards the economic and social development of the\nless advantaged regions of the world.\nIn conclusion, our concerns for the safety of our\npeople must be counter-balanced by the assurances that\nthose responsible for these threats will be dealt with by\na coherent and effective system of trans-frontier justice\nthat reflects respect for the rule of law. The\ninternational community\u00eds endeavours in recent years\nhave found fruition in the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court, a functioning institution\nthat increases its effectiveness the more widely all the\nmembers of the family of nations subscribe to it.\nIn encouraging reflection on these topical issues,\nI feel confident in the credentials offered by my\ncountry, whose level of commitment to the United\nNations certainly makes up for any physical limitations\nwe may have. Malta has been instrumental in\ndeveloping the concept of common heritage, in relation\nboth to the high seas and to climate change, and we\nhave emphasized the importance of intergenerational\nsolidarity, as evidenced not only by our initiatives on\nageing but also as the host country for the International\nInstitute on Ageing.\nAs in previous years, the issues before of the\nGeneral Assembly are many and complex. The density\nand variety of the agenda we have before us are both a\nchallenge and an opportunity for our Organization. I\ntrust that under your able guidance, Mr. President, we\nwill find the energy and wisdom to meet these\nchallenges and exploit these opportunities. Humanity is\ncounting on all of us."

        "file_text": "It gives\nme pleasure to begin my remarks by congratulating\nMr. Ping on the vote of confidence represented by his\nelection as President of the current session of the\nAssembly. Given his wisdom and organizational skills,\nI am confident that he will be able to lead our\ndeliberations successfully. Thus, his positive input will\nfurther enhance the stature and effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations at a time of profound and\nunprecedented transformation on the world scene.\nI wish also to commend the efforts and wisdom of\nhis predecessor for his remarkable stewardship.\nFurthermore, Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General,\ndeserves our gratitude for his persistent efforts to live\nup to the demands of his office in the face of complex\nand daunting challenges and surprises.\nUndoubtedly, the events of the past two years \u2014\nspecifically from the period prior to and after the\noccupation of Iraq \u2014 have shown clearly that, in\ntoday\u2019s world, unilateralism in determining\ninternational action inevitably leads to the proliferation\nof hotbeds of tension, in addition to jeopardizing\ninternational peace and security. At the same time,\nthose events have further demonstrated the relevance\nof multilateralism in global decision-making through\ninternational institutions, especially this world body.\nGiven that the United Nations represents a\nsuperior form of multilateralism, because it brings\ntogether Member States to address common concerns\nover the maintenance of collective security and to face\nuniversal challenges, it is only logical that we all\nshould join together to protect it against\nmarginalization and to safeguard and strengthen its\nrole. Thus, we should not allow the will of one Power,\nor of a certain group of Powers, to direct the actions of\nthe United Nations system or permit it to be used to\nadvance their agenda without regard for the wishes and\ninterests of the rest of the membership.\nA case in point, in our view, is the need to\nreconsider the decision-making process in the Security\nCouncil, its composition and membership. The realities\nof our contemporary world and the imperatives of\n38\n\nglobal security, which is indivisible, must be fully\ntaken into consideration in any review exercise. No\nsingle State or group of States can alone guarantee\nglobal security or assume the responsibility of that\nundertaking without active participation by other\nStates. In addition, decisions that are not in line with\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations or\nthe view of the majority of the membership should be\nvehemently opposed.\nAs this session coincides with the third\nanniversary of the 11 September tragedy, once again\nthe Republic of Yemen reaffirms its commitment to\nfight extremism and terrorism within the framework\nestablished and led by the United Nations. Yemen, for\nits part, has made great progress in combating\nterrorism and terrorists. The most recent achievement\ninvolved defeating a group that had rebelled against the\nConstitution and the rule of law in the Sa\u2019dah region in\nYemen. Those rebels had resorted to terrorism in order\nto achieve their goals. Their terrorist acts harmed\ninnocent civilians and disrupted security and stability\nin the area.\nThe Government of Yemen, while fully\nresponsible for the safety and security of its citizens\nand the homeland, remains faithful to its international\ncommitment to combat terrorism. Our conviction is\nthat terrorism has no specific identity or particular\nreligion. The struggle for national liberation or to end\nforeign occupation is a legitimate right under the\nCharter of the United Nations, international law and\nthe basic principles of justice and human rights. Such a\nstruggle can therefore not be treated as terrorism. In\naddition, Yemen\u2019s experience in combating terrorism\nhas taught us that in order effectively to battle\nterrorism, all possible resources must be deployed,\nincluding its root causes, dialogue, the promotion of\ndevelopment and justice, in addition to good security\nand intelligence work.\nYemen is a strong believer in the United Nations.\nHowever, we believe that, despite all the efforts made\nby the dynamic Secretariat of this great institution, the\ngaps between rich and poor countries are widening.\nThat is partly due to current economic policies that\nstrengthen the dominance of wealthy nations over poor\ncountries. Today more than ever we need to examine in\nearnest the imbalances in international economic\nrelations.\nThe first step we expect in this regard is the\nfulfilment by wealthier nations of the pledges and\nundertakings announced in their initiatives for\nachieving economic balance between the rich and the\npoor. Failure to do so, as I presume all of us recognize,\nwould deepen the sense of bitterness felt by the poor\ncountries. It might also breed extremism and violence\nto which no country would be immune.\nIn that context, the Government of the Republic\nof Yemen believes that the recognition by the leaders\nof the Group of Eight industrial nations that the\nconsolidation of peace in the Middle East and the\npromotion of economic growth and political\ndevelopment through a process of overall development\nin all countries of the region \u2014 as outlined in the G-8\ndeclaration adopted at their most recent Summit in Sea\nIsland, Georgia, United States \u2014 represents a very\nsignificant statement and a positive strategic challenge\nof interest to us and to the international community in\ngeneral.\nIt is indeed a challenge, because this long-\noverdue vision seeks to correct a chronic anomaly. It is\nalso a challenge because of its positive implications\nand the shift in focus it can bring in favour of global\nstability and international peace and security once that\nabstract concept is translated into concrete and\nmeaningful steps on the ground. That will require\ngenuine partnerships and the abandoning of policies of\ncoercion.\nProceeding from these convictions, Yemen\nwelcomed that initiative and agreed to participate in\nthe G-8 Sea Island Summit for two reasons: first,\nbecause that vision is in line with our national plan for\nreform, and, secondly, because we welcome any\npartnership between Arab States, the European Union,\nthe United States of America and the world at large\nthat enhances our development and stability and\ncontributes to the fight against terrorism.\nThe commitment of my Government to build a\nbetter future for the people of Yemen and the people of\nour region has prompted us to institute numerous\neconomic and political reforms, broaden popular\ninvolvement in governance, and strengthen our\npartnership with other countries and entities.\nThis was highlighted in the Sana\u2019a Declaration on\nDemocracy, Human Rights and the Role of the\nInternational Criminal Court, adopted earlier this year\nat the Sana\u2019a Intergovernmental Regional Conference.\n39\n\nA number of other countries, represented by their\nGovernments, Parliaments and civil society, regional\nand international organizations, took part in that forum.\nThe Forum was organized in response to reform\ninitiatives that came from the Governments and\npeoples of the region. It stressed that good democratic\ngovernance and respect for human rights require full\nmobilization of the energies and potential of civil\nsociety. They also require interaction among all\nstakeholders, with a sense of responsibility and\npartnership with Governments, and support from\noutside the region, in order to use overall development\nas a vehicle towards stability, progress and movement\non the road towards democracy and overall human\ndevelopment.\nNo one can ignore the great achievements made\nby our Organization in promoting peace, security and\nwelfare over the course of its rich history. But one\nshould, by the same token, admit that it has failed to\nresolve numerous conflicts that have endangered, and\ncontinue to endanger, the security and stability of many\nnations and peoples. Foremost among these dangers is\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. Certainly, the United Nations\nhas failed to put an end to ongoing Israeli aggression\nagainst the Palestinian people and to Israel\u2019s repeated\nthreats against Arab countries. Also, there are many\ntrouble spots and areas of conflict across the globe that\nthe United Nations must address effectively if we want\ninternational peace and security to prevail.\nThe position of the Republic of Yemen regarding\nthe question of Palestine is abundantly clear. It is based\non the principles laid out by the Quartet in the road\nmap, and on those contained in the Arab Peace\nInitiative. This Initiative calls for the establishment of\na State of Palestine with full sovereignty over its\nterritory and with Jerusalem as its capital; Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since\n4 June 1967; and the return of refugees to their homes.\nAll along, Yemen has maintained that peace in\nthe Middle East will elude us as long as Israel is\nallowed to manoeuvre and circumvent United Nations\nresolutions. We also believe that Israel will not accept\nthe aforesaid solutions unless a Security Council\nresolution is adopted with a view to imposing a\nsolution on Israel that includes an enforcement\nmechanism. Contrary to our hopes, the entire question\nhas become even more intractable and difficult to\ncomprehend, especially given the use of the veto power\nagainst any proposed resolution that would force Israel\nto implement United Nations resolutions. This has\nencouraged Israel to persist in constructing the\nracially-based separation wall, which aggravates the\nsuffering of the Palestinian people and is taking away\nsizeable tracts of their remaining land, in defiance of\nglobal consensus and of the advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ).\nWe wish to emphasize here that, as recent events\nhave demonstrated, the wall cannot guarantee security\nto Israel. Israel\u2019s genuine security could be achieved if\nit were to accept the road map and commit itself to\nimplementing relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe demand that the Security Council ensure the\nphysical safety of the Palestinian President, Yasser\nArafat, provide protection for the Palestinian people\nagainst Israeli state-sponsored terrorism, and show\nrespect for the wishes and the will of the Palestinian\npeople.\nIn addition, Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\nSyrian and Lebanese territories is an integral part of\nany Middle East peace initiative. I wish to recall in this\nregard that the Arab Peace Initiative represents an Arab\nconsensus for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict.\nFurthermore, my Government considers\ninadmissible the threats that the Israeli military\nmachine fires against sister Syria and against Iran from\ntime to time. This represents irresponsible provocation\nthat exacerbates the already tense situation in the\nregion. The timing of these threats further fuels\nviolence and frustrates peace endeavours aimed at\nfinding a just and negotiated settlement of the\nArab-Israeli conflict. They also represent an attempt by\nthe Israeli Government to distract attention from its\nfailure to ensure security for its citizens. The time has\ncome for Israel to recognize that its stability and\nacceptance by countries of the region will remain\nunfulfilled unless it implements the road map and\nrelevant United Nations resolutions, and withdraws\nfrom the occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the\nGolan and the Shab\u2019a farms.\nIn the same context, I wish to affirm my country\u2019s\nsupport for United Nations efforts regarding the\nconvening of a disarmament conference which aims,\ninter alia, at the establishment of the Middle East\nregion as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.\nTo this end, Israel must accede to the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\n40\n\nThe current violence in Iraq, and the violation of\nhuman rights and bloodshed of our Iraqi brothers is an\ninevitable outcome of an invasion. Thus, it is\nincumbent upon the United Nations to fulfil its role, as\nset forth in relevant resolutions, regarding the need to\nprovide support to Iraq with a view to restoring peace\nand stability throughout the country. The interim Iraqi\nGovernment should be empowered to exercise full\nsovereignty in order to lead Iraq towards holding\ndemocratic elections and forming a constitutional\nGovernment that represents the will of the Iraqi people,\nrestores law and order and puts an end to the\noccupation of the country. The tragic situation\nunfolding today in Iraq, in the wake of the downfall of\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s regime, has resulted in terrorism,\nviolations and chaos, which all of us can see. That\nsituation may take Iraq down a slippery slope of\nsectarian violence and conflict which, in turn, will\nthreaten the unity and future of Iraq.\nYemen believes that all of us should assist and\nsupport the interim Government in Iraq and the\nnational and legislative councils to overcome the\ncurrent critical transitional stage in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004), with a view\ntoward safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq. Also, we must ensure that\nthe forthcoming period leading to parliamentary\nelections and the formation of a national Government\nwill reflect the will of the Iraqi people without external\ninterference. All effort should be made to develop and\ndefine political solutions for the complex situation, and\nto provide to the interim Government all it may need in\norder to achieve a successful outcome. Priority should\nbe given to enabling the Iraqi Government to start the\nprocess of national reconciliation, ensuring the\nparticipation of all factions and political groups in\ndefining the future of Iraq and closing the annals of the\npast. We also call for an end to violence against\ncivilians, as well as excessive military reactions by the\noccupation forces, which victimize innocent civilians\nand lead to further destruction, pushing moderates\ntowards extremism.\nIn view of Yemen\u2019s sense of fraternal\nresponsibility towards Iraq, we submitted to the last\nArab summit in Tunis, an initiative conceived on the\nbasis of a set of firm principles set forth in United\nNations resolutions. In essence, the initiative contained\nguiding principles for assisting the brotherly people of\nIraq to overcome their current crisis. It also called for\nsetting timelines to link efforts to restore security and\nstability with ending of the occupation. In the\nmeantime, Yemen supports any Arab or international\nendeavour that might help Iraq move safely to achieve\npeace, stability and national unity.\nMy country believes that national reconciliation\nbased on dialogue and national unity is a viable path\ntoward settling the long-running dispute and conflict in\nSomalia. Therefore, we congratulate the Somali leaders\non the progress they have so far achieved within the\nframework of the reconciliation process. At the same\ntime, we call upon all warring factions in Somalia to\nbuild on that success and to put the highest national\ninterests of Somalia ahead of their own agendas.\nYemen, which has played a leading role in promoting\nnational reconciliation in Somalia, calls upon the\nUnited Nations and the international community to\nassume fully and effectively their responsibilities in\norder to bring about peace and security in Somalia.\nThe Yemeni Government appreciates the current\nefforts being made to assist the national reconciliation\ntalks in Somalia to reach a successful outcome, that is\nthe formation of a consultative council, election of a\nPresident for the country, and formation of an interim\nGovernment that will lead Somalia towards drafting a\nnew constitution and setting up a democratic system of\ngovernment. Yemen, of course, will align itself with\nthe good offices of the Governments of Djibouti,\nEthiopia and Kenya, and supported by the European\nUnion and the United States, to promote reconciliation.\nThe Republic of Yemen has been closely\nfollowing the humanitarian situation in the Darfur\nprovince of sisterly Sudan. I wish to underline here the\ndecisions adopted by the Council of Arab Foreign\nMinisters, which met at the headquarters of the Arab\nLeague early last August. That meeting was also\nattended by the head of the African Union Commission\nand the Foreign Minister of Nigeria representing\nPresident Obasanjo of Nigeria \u2014 the current Chairman\nof the African Union. We wish also to reaffirm the\ndecisions adopted in this regard by the Council of Arab\nForeign Ministers in its regular session on 14 and\n15 September. Those decisions reflected the joint\nArab-African position regarding the situation in Darfur.\nThey affirmed the need to address the matter within the\nAfrican Arab framework. They also rejected all\nattempts to create a rift in Arab-African relations and\nstressed that there was no hard evidence of genocide.\nFurthermore, the meeting underlined the responsibility\n41\n\nof the Government of the Sudan for maintaining\nsecurity and stability, providing protection for its\ncitizens and disarming all militias in the region. The\nsuccess of the Sudanese Government in achieving\nthose goals will depend on the degree of international\nsupport and humanitarian relief assistance provided to\nit. All external parties must also refrain from\ninterfering in the internal affairs of the Sudan.\nThe Government of the Sudan must assume its\nresponsibility for deploying its forces so as to ensure\nsecurity, provide protection for all of its citizens and\nconfront all of the armed groups responsible for the\ncrisis. In the meantime, all the logistical support\nneeded by the Government of Sudan should be\nprovided by the African Union and Arab States with a\nview to achieving those objectives.\nThe Sudan\u2019s response to relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, including the steps it has begun to\ntake, clearly demonstrate its genuine commitment to its\nundertakings. Furthermore, we call on the United\nNations, especially the Security Council, to address the\nissue on the basis of an accurate assessment of the\nsituation in Darfur which obviously has begun to\nimprove. We must avoid favouring one side at the\nexpense of the other. We should also shift our focus to\naddress the humanitarian situation without regard to\npolitical considerations or motives. All of the parties to\nthe Darfur dispute, including the Government of the\nSudan, should be urged to participate constructively\nand unconditionally in peace talks, with a view to\nachieving a just solution to the crisis. Any attempt to\nuse blackmail or to exploit events to the advantage of\nthe rebel groups must be rejected. Any party that\nviolates its commitments, as verified by a neutral\nsecurity monitoring mechanism, should be held\naccountable.\nThe Government of the Republic of Yemen\nstresses that threatening or imposing a unilateral\nboycott or economic sanctions, as practised against\nsome Member States, would constitute an explicit\nviolation of the principles of international law \u2014\nregardless of the fact that such practices have failed on\nthe ground in more than one case. Indeed, sanctions\nand boycotts aggravate the suffering of innocent\ncivilians and lead to the escalation of hostilities.\nMy country supports the call by the United\nNations to end unilateral measures, and it affirms the\nneed to promote a culture of dialogue and\nunderstanding, even when dealing with controversial\nissues. That should, indeed, be the rational and\ncivilized approach that all of us should pursue in\nresolving our disputes and mending our relationships.\nFinally, my delegation wishes the General\nAssembly every success as it endeavours to fulfil its\nmandate during this session, with a view to reinforcing\nour common action to promote peace, security and\nwelfare for all. It is our hope that the ongoing reform\nof the United Nations will achieve the long-awaited\nobjectives, including equitable representation in the\nSecurity Council. That would enhance the Council\u2019s\neffectiveness and credibility and enable it to adapt\nbetter to the constantly changing landscape of\ninternational relations.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm that the\nRepublic of Yemen will support any efforts aimed at\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations and\nenhancing its credibility, safeguarding the sovereignty\nand will of its Member States and pooling our energies\nto create a better future for humankind."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. You can be assured\nof Jamaica\u2019s fullest support and cooperation during\nyour tenure.\nThe outgoing President, Julian Hunte of Saint\nLucia, deserves commendation for his energy and\noutstanding leadership during the fifty-eighth session,\nduring which he achieved significant accomplishments,\nparticularly in the area of the revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly. He leaves a legacy of a\nstrengthened presidency and a good foundation for\nfurther operational improvements in the work of the\nAssembly and in its relations with other organs.\nIn reviewing the developments of the past year,\nwe note that the anticipated growth in the global\neconomy has been dampened by uncertainties arising\nfrom macro-economic imbalances in larger economies\nand the impact of increased oil prices. Political\ninstability in many regions of the world has not abated\nand, in some cases, has increased to critical levels.\nMany developing countries continue to struggle for\nsurvival in the globalized economy, especially in the\nface of changing commodity regimes, the erosion of\npreferences and unfavourable market conditions. The\ngap between rich and poor continues to widen. There\nmay be some glimmers of hope, but more needs to be\ndone to correct existing imbalances and to broaden\nopportunities for all to share in global prosperity.\nFormidable challenges remain for developing\ncountries.\n25\n\nIn our part of the world, those challenges have\ntaken on grave new proportions in the wake of the\nrecent spate of hurricanes which have devastated the\nCaribbean and affected several States of the United\nStates of America. In the Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba,\nthe Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Grenada,\nHaiti and my own country, Jamaica, the loss of life and\nthe scale of destruction and damage to infrastructure,\nproperty and means of livelihood have been\ncatastrophic. What had taken several generations to\nbuild has suddenly vanished and will take years to\nrecover. The case of Grenada, which was virtually\nobliterated, is particularly striking. For those who have\nhad doubts about the reality of the vulnerability of\nsmall island States, these recent events should be\nconvincing evidence.\nIn Jamaica, we are completing our estimates of\nthe damage from Hurricane Ivan, which struck on\n10 September, virtually on the anniversary date of\nHurricane Gilbert, still painfully fresh in our memory.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of\nJamaica, I extend deep appreciation to the Member\nStates, the agencies of the United Nations, and other\ninternational and non-governmental organizations\nwhich have given assistance. We have launched an\ninternational appeal to support our national efforts for\nimmediate and long-term recovery. Apart from the\nprovision of emergency relief supplies, there is a need\nfor concessionary financing to the affected countries,\nso as to facilitate medium- to long-term reconstruction.\nOne means of doing this would be through the\nestablishment of a special fund.\nIn the context of these recent developments, the\n10-year review of the implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for Small Island Developing\nStates, to be held in Mauritius in January 2005, is a\ntimely opportunity for the international community to\nundertake special consideration of the vulnerability of\nsmall island States. We expect the Mauritius review to\nadopt concrete measures and call for serious\nconsideration to be given to mechanisms to support the\nrecovery and reconstruction efforts of small island\ndeveloping States in the aftermath of natural disasters.\nWhat should also command attention are the\ndangers posed by climate change and global warming\nand the urgent need for global action within the\nframework of the Kyoto Protocol. It is imperative that\nall States accede to the Protocol.\nIt is accepted that the benefits of globalization are\nnot being fully realized, especially in the area of\ninternational trade. We should seek to harness its\npotential to the benefit of developed and developing\ncountries alike. Interdependence makes this an\nimperative. Global economic health requires better\nmanagement of economic arrangements at all levels, to\nensure a more equitable distribution of global\nprosperity.\nThe situation of small developing economies\nmakes a compelling case. From any objective\nstandpoint, there is a need for special and differential\ntreatment in relation to trade, the flow of financial\nresources, the transfer of technology and the promotion\nof industrial development. The gap between rich and\npoor must be narrowed. Otherwise, many developing\ncountries will continue in a downward spiral of\ndeclining income and increased poverty, with painful\nconsequences such as political and social instability\nand recurring humanitarian crises. While there is no\nsubstitute for self-reliance, on the basis of the principle\nof shared responsibility, there is a role for all\nparticipants within the global economic system.\nThat is why international cooperation for\ndevelopment should be given a central place in our\ndeliberations. There is a need to create institutional\ncapacity in the United Nations for the direction and\ncoordination of policies affecting finance, trade and\ntechnology and for formulating the overall policies\nguiding international economic cooperation. Such a\nmechanism could forge effective linkages with the\nBretton Woods institutions in order to manage and\npromote coherence in international economic\nprogrammes and policies. It should effectively respond\nto economic crises as they arise and apply remedies for\nimbalances and disequilibrium in the global economy.\nSome tentative steps have been taken in that\ndirection in the wake of the Monterrey Conference, but\nmuch more is required to reform governance in the\ninternational economic system to make it more\ndemocratic, transparent and responsive to the real\nneeds and priorities of developing countries.\nThe cycle of violence resulting from war and\nterrorism is a troubling phenomenon of our time.\nInternational security is dangerously at risk. What is\nclear to us is that violence and the use of force cannot\nbe the answer. We must embrace multilateralism and\n26\n\ninsist that international relations be guided by the rule\nof law as the basis for our collective security.\nAgainst that background, the necessary steps\nmust be taken to strengthen multilateralism. The\nUnited Nations must be our instrument of choice.\nThere is no viable alternative to the Organization, and\nit can be made as effective as it needs to be only if it is\ngiven the powers and resources that are required. We\nmust continue to nourish and strengthen it and make\nadaptations in the face of changing realities to improve\nits effectiveness and enhance its credibility. Reform\ncould begin with the Security Council, to make it more\nrepresentative in membership, more democratic in its\ndecision-making and more accountable and transparent\nin its operations. These are necessary for its\neffectiveness and legitimacy. We look forward to\nreceiving the recommendations of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\nChange.\nThe improvement of international security\ndepends on our finding durable solutions to regional\nconflicts and disputes. In Africa, there is a need to\nexpedite relief for humanitarian emergencies, to\npromote initiatives aimed at resolving internecine\nconflicts and to advance the struggle for economic and\nsocial progress. We are distressed by the deterioration\nin the political and humanitarian situation in the Darfur\nregion of the Sudan, and we support constructive\nefforts to bring an end to the disruption and the\nbloodshed. We commend the role of the African Union\naimed at resolving the crisis.\nWe continue to call for good sense and wisdom to\ndefuse the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Jamaica believes\nthat only through a process of political accommodation\nand the settlement of legitimate claims and grievances,\non the basis of justice and legality, can there be any\nhope for a durable peace.\nThe war in Iraq has opened up further\ncomplexities and further divisions and is becoming a\ndangerous source of continuing conflict. A political\nsolution is needed to bring about national\nreconciliation and peace.\nSmall countries face particular dangers in\nmaintaining stability and security. I am referring to the\nincreasing production, distribution and proliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons and of sophisticated\nammunition. These represent our greatest security\nthreat. Small States do not produce these weapons, but\nthey have become the principal victims of them. The\ninflux of these weapons through various illicit channels\nis fuelling civil conflict and criminal violence whose\nextent and intensity beleaguer and often overwhelm\nnational security forces. It is estimated in the 2004\nSmall Arms Survey that the proliferation and misuse of\nsmall arms contributes annually to approximately\n200,000 to 270,000 civilian deaths, 40 per cent of\nwhich are concentrated in the Latin American and\nCaribbean region.\nEqually disturbing to us is the insufficient\nappreciation of these dangers by those countries that\nare the producers and source of the weapons. We\nmaintain that such States have a duty to prevent illicit\ntransfers beyond their borders. Additionally, we need\nmore effective cooperation to regulate and restrict the\nmovement of these weapons and to have effective\nregistration and monitoring of transfers, operating\nwithin a framework of legally binding obligations.\nFor that reason, it is urgent that we move to\nconclude the negotiations for an international\nconvention to achieve those objectives. We make this\ndemand for action on the basis of the principle of the\nequal right to security for all States. The threats and\ndangers we face are as valid as those arising from the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These\nalso demand collective action; and, in this, Jamaica has\nbeen unrelenting in its support of effective measures\naimed at curtailing the spread of nuclear and other\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThe year 2004 was declared the International\nYear for the Commemoration of the Struggle Against\nSlavery and its Abolition. Our history makes this a\nspecial commemoration. We also celebrate the 200th\nanniversary of the independence of Haiti. The Haitian\nrevolution was an achievement of immense historical\nimportance that significantly influenced the shaping of\nthe modern world. It established the first free nation in\nthe Western Hemisphere, and it struck the first decisive\nblow that eventually brought about the overthrow of\nthe system of slavery in the Americas. The revolution\nwas a story of heroism and triumph, creating a legacy\nthat has sustained the Haitian people during a long and\noften lonely struggle for survival over the years, in the\nharsh realties of a hostile world of racism and\ndiscrimination.\nSadly, the bicentennial celebration has been\novershadowed by circumstances of instability and\n27\n\npolitical crisis that continue even now. The events of\nFebruary still cast a shadow and leave lingering\nconcerns about how the democratically elected\nPresident demitted office. The sequence of events and\nthe timing of the Security Council in reacting to the\ncrisis were unfortunate. At the same time, Jamaica\nrecognizes that Haiti requires the support and\nassistance of the international community, which must\nbe sustained over the long term to ensure its\neffectiveness. The rebuilding of democracy and the\ncreation of a stable social, economic and political order\ncannot be accomplished overnight, and therefore it\nshould be pursued with perseverance and the\ncommitment of the necessary resources.\nWe share the anguish and grief of the people of\nHaiti at the tragic loss of life and devastation caused by\nthe recent hurricane. The Caribbean Community will\ncontinue to do its part in providing emergency\nassistance.\nThis year, we commemorate the tenth anniversary\nof the establishment of the International Seabed\nAuthority. For all of us, and for Jamaica, that is a\nsignificant milestone in the quiet evolution and\npromotion of a legal regime for the seabed, which\nembodies the principle of the common heritage of\nmankind. What we, as a community, can take from this\nto other spheres of international relations is the\nimportance of upholding the rule of law and the pre-\neminence of the principles of justice and equity. The\nSecretary-General rightly emphasized the importance\nof those norms last Tuesday when introducing his\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/59/1).\nThe international community should not stand\nidly by in the presence of violations of international\nlaw and the promotion of doctrines that run counter to\nthe principles of multilateralism. That is why Jamaica\nasks of this fifty-ninth session that all States recommit\nthemselves to the principles on which the Organization\nwas founded to promote peace, equality and justice for\nall its Members. Let us take the necessary steps to put\nthose principles into practice and to make them the\nfoundation of our policies and programmes. Our\nuniversal objective must be to implement the noble\nideals to which we subscribe, not just to articulate\nthem."

        "file_text": "The delegation\nof Senegal would like to congratulate you very warmly,\nMr. President, on your election to the presidency of the\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I assure\nyou of our full support as you carry out your noble\nwork. I also wish to extend my congratulations and\nencouragement to all the members of the Bureau.\nI would also like to recognize the commitment of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, whose tireless efforts\nto make the United Nations a strong, working and\ncredible Organization reflects his faith in the ideals of\npeace, development and concord among peoples. We\nmust now continue to breathe life into these ideals, so\nthat current and future generations will have a peaceful\nand safe world, a world without absurd hatred or\ngratuitous violence. This vision should lead us to re-\ninvigorate the values of multilateralism and universality\nthat are epitomized by our Organization. In other words,\nthe world needs now, more than ever, a United Nations\nthat is strong and strengthened in its legitimacy.\nWe welcome, therefore, the decision of the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to establish a panel\nof eminent persons on threats, challenges and change,\nwhose conclusions will be presented next December. In\nthis respect, we recall the African position on reform of\nthe Security Council, which advocates among other\nthings, the assignment to Africa of at least two\npermanent seats and two extra non-permanent seats.\nAfrica would choose the recipients of those seats\naccording to a process that has yet to be determined.\nAs I extol universality, I feel it is unfair that the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, with its 23 million\ninhabitants, its major democratic system and its\nimpressive economic vitality, would still be sidelined\nfrom the work of the United Nations, whose Charter\ndoes rightly enshrine the essential principles of justice\nand universality.\nThis denial of justice also affects the valiant\npeople of Palestine, who, under the legitimate authority\nof President Yasser Arafat, have been deprived of its\nfundamental right to sovereignty and ongoing\nexistence. The defiant attitude of the occupying Power\nvis-\u00e0-vis the international community, recently\nillustrated by the Israeli authorities\u2019 refusal to abide by\nthe opinion of the International Court of Justice\nrequiring Israel to immediately stop the illegal building\n2\n\nof the separation wall in Palestinian territory, imperils\nthe foundations of international legality. I solemnly\nappeal to the international community and, in\nparticular, to the members of the Quartet, asking them\nto persevere in their efforts for an immediate\nresumption of dialogue, so that we may achieve a fair,\nequitable and lasting solution to this disagreement. The\npeoples of Palestine and Israel, needless to recall, are\ncondemned by history and geography to live together.\nFor our part, Senegal, which chairs the United\nNations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable\nRights of the Palestinian People, will continue, with its\npeople, to unfailingly support the Palestinian people,\nbattered by this crisis that has lasted far too long. As a\ncontribution to the quest for peace, I suggested that we\nconduct a special meeting, outside our regular work, on\nthe situation in Palestine aimed at enhancing the work\nlaunched by the Quartet and in the spirit of the road\nmap, in order to establish by 2005 a sovereign and\nviable Palestinian State, living side by side with the\nState of Israel, within safe and internationally\nrecognized borders guaranteed for the two States. This\ninitiative, which has already been endorsed by the\nNon-Aligned Movement and the African Union, will\nprovide an opportunity to mobilize the international\ncommunity around the effective implementation of the\nroad map.\nIn awarding me yesterday the 2004 Human\nRights Award, the International League for Human\nRights in fact honoured, through Senegal\u2019s head of\nState, all of the Senegalese people, a people attached to\nfreedom and to the respect of human dignity. My\nGovernment will continue to work to promote and\nprotect human rights, the rule of law and good public\nand private governance. In talking about human rights,\nI am naturally thinking of the fundamental rights of\nwomen, children, disabled persons, seniors and all\nvulnerable people. This deep commitment to mankind\nmotivated my decision to submit draft legislation to the\nSenegalese national assembly to abolish capital\npunishment in Senegal.\nAlmost 60 years after the establishment of our\nOrganization, our world, which is so fragile, still sees\nlongstanding dangers such as nuclear proliferation and\nthe emergence of new dangers such as terrorism and\nAIDS, which represent a serious threat to international\npeace and security. I must remind Members here of the\nneed to do more to strengthen, under the leadership of\nthe Security Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee,\nthe mechanisms that already exist for cooperation and\ntechnical assistance in order to provide those countries\nwho so wish human, technical and adequate financial\nresources to combat terrorism. This initiative, of\ncourse, must be paired with States\u2019 increased adherence\nto treaties and protocols in this key area. It is for this\npurpose that the African Union adopted last July an\nadditional protocol to the Organization of African\nUnity\u2019s Algiers Convention on the Prevention and\nCombating of Terrorism, proposed by Senegal on\n17 October 2001 at the African conference on\nterrorism, held in Dakar.\nThis collective approach should also be adopted\nto tackle the difficult problem of small arms and light\nweapons. Senegal supports making the moratorium on\nthe importation, exportation and production of small\narms and light weapons of the Economic Community\nof West African States into a convention in West\nAfrica, since these arms are truly weapons of mass\ndestruction in our subregion.\nThere are other destructive scourges. I would like\nto speak about AIDS. In accordance with the\ndeclaration that we adopted in 2001, we must act more\nquickly and more vigorously in critical areas such as\nprevention and access to antiretroviral treatments if we\nreally do wish to stop this disease and its devastating\neffects. Since antiretroviral medication is now free for\nall those who are afflicted, thanks to our tenacity,\nSenegal has remained a success story in combating\nAIDS.\nAnother seemingly ignored ill is poliomyelitis,\nwhich we have completely eliminated in Senegal.\nHowever, this scourge remains as serious as ever in the\nrest of Africa.\nDuring this second trimester of 2004, the North\nand West parts of Africa have witnessed the invasion\nof swarms of locusts, the dreaded scourge which has\ninfested large agricultural areas in the region of the\nSahel and some North African countries. This threat,\nwhich has already destroyed entire civilizations, is now\ncompromising the lives of tens of millions of people\nright before harvest time. At the very beginning, I\npersonally sounded the alarm, speaking to the\ninternational community in Rome last March. Despite\nanother appeal by the Director-General of the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),\nassistance was late in coming and is only now under\nway, but in ways that are not very effective.\n3\n\nWhatever the case may be, Senegal has begun to\nwork on this issue, and today we are succeeding in\ncontaining this danger. Together with neighbouring\ncountries, the countries bordering the Sahel, we are\ntrying to launch an extensive campaign for the final\nelimination of these locusts. In this regard, we note\nwith great satisfaction the involvement of African\ncountries, including Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, South\nAfrica, Libya and Egypt in this issue. Today, our\npeople remain concerned about the possible migration\nof these locusts, carried by the wind, to other areas in\nthe region, in particular to the Maghreb. We are also\npleased to announce that we have received substantial\nsupport by the World Bank, among other international\norganizations. This means that we have a shared\nresponsibility to strengthen and mobilize the\ninternational community against locusts and, if we\nsucceed in saving the crops, to completely eliminate\nthem, starting at their source.\nThe task at hand in this area should not make us\nlose sight of the huge field of work that remains to be\ntackled, namely combating the poverty that strikes\nmillions of people throughout the world, in particular\nin the least developed countries so that we can achieve\nthe Millennium Development Goals in terms of\nagriculture. I must say here that I am satisfied with the\noutcome of the meeting that was held on the initiative\nof President Lula, the President of Brazil.\nYet we all see and are concerned that, as has been\nemphasized by the Secretary-General and others, in\nspite of the relative improvement in the economic\nsituation in Africa since 1995, the chances of our\ncontinent achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals are still rather low given the lack of progress to\ndate. Implementation of those Goals is particularly at risk\neven at a time when the world economy is progressing\nin an encouraging way: Africa continues, mainly\nbecause of the export subsidies of developed countries,\nto be marginalized in world trade. It is a truism to say\nthat those subsidies help to impoverish African\nproducer countries and increase unemployment.\nAnother problem is the thorny issue of African\ndebt. The continent has dedicated itself to resolution of\nthis problem: next year we will hold a major summit\npreceded by a technical meeting on ending Africa\u2019s\nindebtedness.\nThe Extraordinary Summit of the African Union\non Employment and Poverty Alleviation in Africa, just\nheld in Ouagadougou on 8 and 9 September, illustrates\nour continent\u2019s determination to continue to devote\nspecial attention to the fight against unemployment,\nwhich is a key priority for development. A successful\noutcome \u2014 in keeping with the outcomes of the various\nsummits which have given direction to the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) \u2014\nrequires the international community to make a\nstronger commitment, alongside Africa, to help\nmaterialize this important partnership programme. And\nthat is why I say that I am pleased to see the progress\nwe have made on NEPAD financing since the Group of\nEight (G-8) meeting in Kananaskis, Canada.\nAlthough insufficiently highlighted, efforts for\nAfrican development made under NEPAD and the\nsupport actions of the international community \u2014\nparticularly those taken by the G-8 and the United\nNations system \u2014 are still in evidence, which pleases\nme. We have made basically two proposals. The first\nhas to do with the convening in Senegal\u2019s capital of an\nagricultural forum, on the model of the Davos\neconomic forum, for the purpose, inter alia, of closing\nthe world agricultural gap. It will be held in February\n2005 in Dakar.\nThe ever-growing digital divide separates the\ndeveloped countries from the developing countries. In\nDecember 2003 in Geneva, the Secretary-General\nconvened The World Summit on the Information\nSociety. On that occasion, Africa proposed, through\nmyself, the idea of digital solidarity among peoples and\nthe establishment of a digital solidarity fund based on\nvolunteer efforts and not funded by any mandatory tax.\nThat idea was received with unanimous enthusiasm by\ndeveloping countries \u2014 Africa, Asia, Brazil, the\nMiddle East \u2014 and by a developed country: France.\nSubsequently, the inaugural congress for the United\nCities and Local Governments organization was held in\nParis in May 2004; participants officially announced\ntheir participation in the digital solidarity fund. To the\ncities already mentioned elsewhere, I could add Rome,\nParis, Lille and Bilbao.\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has\nestablished a task force on financing the information\nsociety under the decision adopted at Geneva.\nProviding Africa with the hardware and other computer\ntechnology it needs is the only way to give us access to\nthe knowledge that accelerates development and,\nwhich, in turn, will help to close the digital divide.\n4\n\nAs members can see, the challenges we face are\nenormous, numerous and pressing. The time has come\nto strengthen the foundations of international\ncooperation and, once and for all, to exorcize the risk\nof social bipolarization throughout the world where\naffluence rubs elbows with the most extreme poverty\nand where the values of solidarity and respect for the\nsacredness of human life become vain words. That is\nwhy I suggested that we hold an international\nconference in Dakar on an Islamic-Christian dialogue,\nwhose objectives would be to help us better understand\none another, to strengthen peaceful coexistence\nbetween Muslims and Christians and to promote a\ndialogue among cultures.\nThus, by hosting the eleventh Islamic Summit in\n2006, Senegal, which has a majority Muslim\npopulation living in perfect harmony with their\nChristian brothers, will continue its action to promote\nfruitful inter-religious dialogue focused on the\nsacrosanct principle of respect for the cultural and\nreligious identities of all peoples."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Nigeria, and in my capacity\nas the current Chairman of the African Union (AU), I\nwould like to extend my sincere congratulations to you,\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\nfifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I assure\nyou of the support and cooperation of Africa, of which\n10\n\nyou are an illustrious son. I would also like to express\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency The\nRight Honourable Julian R. Hunte, Minister for\nExternal Affairs of Saint Lucia, for the dedication and\nskill with which he presided over the affairs of the\nfifty-eighth session. I commend Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for his effective leadership and for his\nefforts to maintain the status of the United Nations in\nthe face of enormous global challenges.\nNigeria remains unshakeable in its commitment\nto and support for the strengthening of the United Nations\nand the protection of its cherished ideals, in particular the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\ncooperation among States to resolve international\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems.\nThe problem posed by the unremitting conflicts in\nvarious regions of the world and the increasingly\ndifficult task of finding solutions to them continue to\npose serious challenges to the world body.\nNigeria and the African Union (AU) commend\nthe United Nations for its determined engagement in\ncrisis resolution and peacekeeping, particularly in\nAfrica. We have noted with appreciation the changes in\nthe concept of peacekeeping. Nevertheless, we believe\nthat some improvements are still necessary to enable\nUnited Nations peace operations to address the social\nand economic challenges that inevitably confront\ncountries emerging from conflict. Those socio-\neconomic issues invariably form an important part of\nthe original causes of the conflict.\nWe also appeal for continued enhancement of the\ncapacity of regional organizations to undertake initiatives\non crisis resolution in their respective regions. For its\npart, the African Union has worked to improve its\nMechanism for Conflict Resolution, and in May this\nyear established a Peace and Security Council.\nThe first challenge the AU Peace and Security\nCouncil has faced has been the situation in the Darfur\nregion of western Sudan, which aroused world attention\nbecause of the reported carnage there. On behalf of the\nAU, I want to thank the international community for\nthe humanitarian intervention being undertaken. As is\nwell known, the AU has deployed troops to the region\nto monitor a ceasefire between the Government of the\nSudan and the opposing movements \u2014 the Sudan\nLiberation Movement/Army and the Justice and\nEquality Movement. Moreover, the first substantive\npeace talks took place under the auspices of the AU in\nthe Nigerian capital of Abuja from 23 August to\n18 September 2004. At that meeting, the Sudanese\nparties reached agreement on the first of the four points\non the agenda, namely, humanitarian issues. They also\nmade progress on the second point, security issues,\nbefore adjourning for consultations. A follow-up\nmeeting is expected to be convened in Abuja around\n21 October 2004 on the other issues: political and\neconomic and social issues. I am closely following the\ndevelopments, in consultation with the Chairperson of\nthe Commission of the African Union and others, and I\nnow call upon the international community to continue\nto lend us its support in resolving the Darfur conflict\nand its consequences.\nIt is cheering to note the progress being made in\nSomalia, particularly in constituting the Parliament.\nThe efforts of the regional countries, which are\ndemonstrating unprecedented collaboration in helping\nthe Somalis to move the process forward, should be\napplauded. The Somalis themselves must continue to\ndemonstrate their commitment to repair past errors and\nto make their country a respectable member of the AU\nand the United Nations.\nThe Great Lakes region remains a flash point of\nviolence, as exemplified by the recent massacre of\nmore than 150 persons in a refugee camp in Burundi.\nOn 25 June 2004, President Kabila of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and President Kagame of\nRwanda met in Abuja at my invitation and agreed to\nactivate the Joint Verification Mechanism. Thereafter,\nwith the participation of the Secretary-General, a\nmeeting of all stakeholders was held during the third\nAfrican Union Summit, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,\nfrom 6 to 8 July 2004, in order to accelerate the\nactivation of the Joint Verification Mechanism. I am\nhopeful that this renewed process will facilitate a better\nunderstanding of how to stem the spate of massacres\nand engender a peaceful resolution of the protracted\ncrisis in the Great Lakes region.\nWith regard to the West African subregion, the\nAfrican Union and the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) are continuing their efforts,\nwith the constant support of the United Nations, to\nensure steady progress in the peace processes in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire and Liberia. To that end, and in order to\naddress the standstill in the implementation of the\nLinas-Marcoussis Agreement on C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, an\nextraordinary summit was held under ECOWAS\nauspices in Accra, Ghana, on 29 July 2004. The\n11\n\nmeeting benefited from the presence of Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan and some non-ECOWAS African\nheads of State. If the agreements reached at that\nsummit are faithfully implemented, an end to the\nconflict should be in sight.\nIn the margins of the Accra summit, we also\naddressed problems that were retarding the\nimplementation of the Liberian Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement. In discussions with all the Liberian\nleaders, we agreed decisions on the main issues, and\nwe have since witnessed encouraging signs that those\ndecisions are being implemented.\nHere, I should like to remark once again that the\ndelay in providing the resources promised by countries\nduring the Liberian pledging conference held at United\nNations Headquarters in February 2004 constitutes an\navoidable hindrance to the advancement of peace in\nLiberia. I therefore call on all our well-meaning\npartners who were kind enough to make pledges to\nkindly redeem them.\nWhile the United Nations is justifiably seized of\nthe issue of weapons of mass destruction \u2014 such as\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons \u2014 the question\nof small arms and light weapons can no longer be\nignored. While the threat of weapons of mass\ndestruction is awesome, small arms and light weapons\nare killing people every day at a rate that,\ncumulatively, amounts to monumental destruction.\nNigeria and the African Union welcome the\ncommencement of negotiations on a legally binding\ninternational instrument to enable States to identify and\ntrace illicit small arms and light weapons globally. Of\nparticular interest to Africa is the enormous potential\nthat such a legally binding instrument can have on\npeace and security in our region. We should therefore\nnot relent in our efforts.\nLet me take this opportunity to soundly condemn\nthe totally unacceptable role of mercenaries and their\nsponsors in Africa. The recent attempted invasion of\nEquatorial Guinea and other such attempts go against\nevery imaginable rational effort at promoting stability\nand democracy on the continent. We call on the United\nNations to join the African Union in sending the right\nsignals of condemnation to those mercenaries and their\nsponsors.\nOur quest for global peace and security will\nprove unsuccessful unless we intensify international\ncooperation for development and the reduction of\npoverty. Just four years ago, we adopted the\nMillennium Development Goals, which pointedly fixed\nthe target of reducing by half the number of those\nliving in poverty by 2015. Yet by now, the alarm is\nbeing raised that, if present trends continue, that target\nmay not be met, particularly in Africa, which aside\nfrom the challenges of development, is also being\nravaged by pandemic diseases.\nSpeaking on behalf of the African Union as its\ncurrent Chairperson, I should like to assure the General\nAssembly that we Africans are determined to exert all\nour efforts to overcome those obstacles to development\nthat are within our control. To that end, we are\npursuing, with the personal commitment and\ninvolvement of our heads of State and Government\nthemselves, the implementation of the priorities set out\nin our flagship programme, the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development (NEPAD).\nIn that context, we appreciate the conclusion in\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s second consolidated report on\nprogress in implementation and international support\nfor NEPAD that\n\u201cAfrican countries have demonstrated their\ncommitment to advancing the implementation of\nNEPAD by earmarking financial allocations to\nselected sectoral priorities.\u201d (A/59/206, para. 67)\nThe report also concludes that\n\u201cThe development partners of Africa can\ngive further practical expression to their support\nfor the efforts of African countries by taking\naction in three important areas: first, by creating\nan enabling international environment that is\nsupportive of growth and development in Africa;\nsecond, by bringing much needed coherence to\ntrade, aid and debt policies, so that African\ncountries are the net beneficiaries of international\nactions in those areas; and third, by undertaking\nconcrete measures to accelerate the\nimplementation of NEPAD by making significant\nfinancial outlays to fund the key sectoral\npriorities of NEPAD.\u201d (ibid., para. 68)\nI believe that the message to our development\npartners is very clear. To demonstrate our commitment\nto the principles of good governance, transparency and\nthe rule of law, 23 African countries have already\nsubscribed to the African Peer Review Mechanism. It\nshould be recalled that the Mechanism represents\n12\n\nAfrica\u2019s voluntary commitment to a set of performance\ncodes and standards to foster best practices and share\nlessons in the management of national affairs. The\npromotion of agriculture is being vigorously pursued\nboth for its export potential and for poverty alleviation.\nEncouraging growth rates in agricultural production\nare already being recorded in several African countries.\nSimultaneously, we are intensifying our efforts in the\npromotion of agro-based industries.\nTo further our efforts at self-help, the heads of\nState and Government of the African Union held the\nExtraordinary Summit on Employment and Poverty\nAlleviation in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, from 5 to\n9 September 2004. We adopted a far-reaching\ndeclaration and programme of action. We also adopted\nmechanisms for implementation and monitoring at the\nnational, regional and continental levels.\nWhat may act as an obstacle to implementation in\nthis most important area for lifting the African\npopulation out of poverty and misery is the inevitable\nissue of having adequate resources for meeting our\notherwise realistic goals. On behalf of the African\nUnion, I appeal to our partners to act once again in the\ninterest of our shared, common global interdependence\nand common humanity.\nAfrica requires a genuine partnership anchored on\nthe principle of mutual benefits to ensure the\nattainment of sustainable development. One area of\npartnership concerns Africa\u2019s external debts. The\nnegative impact of debt on the economic situation of\nAfrican countries, particularly the least developed\ncountries, can no longer be denied. We remain\nconvinced that comprehensively resolving the lingering\ndebt crisis through innovative action would brighten\nthe prospects of development in Africa.\nAfrica welcomes the consensus that emerged\nfrom the recent meeting of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development in S\u00e3o Paulo,\nBrazil. That consensus reflects a shared conviction that\nthe Organization can continue to coordinate our views\non trade and development matters. This cannot be\notherwise if the Millennium Development Goals are to\nbe achieved and the benefits of expanding trade are to\nbe enjoyed by all peoples and societies.\nBy launching a new initiative to commence a new\nround of multilateral trade negotiations, developing\ncountries have issued a challenge to our development\npartners to exploit global opportunities for growth and\ndevelopment. We hope they will respond.\nAfrica remains committed to the fight against the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria, tuberculosis and related\ndiseases. Since the last series of high-level plenary\nmeetings on implementation of the Declaration of\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, we have taken bold steps\nto deal with the pandemic. Towards that end, we in\nNigeria have established a national scientific institute\nfor research on HIV/AIDS and intensified public\nawareness programmes. In that connection, we\nwelcome the outcome of the recent International\nConference on HIV/AIDS in Bangkok, Thailand. We\nthank the United Nations agencies and all stakeholders\nfor their collective efforts to stem the spread of the\ndisease worldwide.\nWith regard to other deadly preventable diseases,\nsuch as malaria, tuberculosis, polio and whooping\ncough, my Government has stepped up its efforts. In a\nfew days, on 2 October 2004, my Government will\nonce again embark on a polio immunization\nprogramme, in coordination with six African States \u2014\nChad, the Sudan, Cameroon, Niger, Burkina Faso and\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 to ensure maximum effectiveness.\nThese are countries where polio has been reported\nfairly recently. Significantly and symbolically, the\nprogramme\u2019s launch, with all my brothers and\ncolleagues present, will take place in Kano.\nLast year, the Secretary-General launched a\nUnited Nations reform initiative that we all warmly\ncommended. In pursuit of that initiative, the Secretary-\nGeneral appointed last year a high-level Panel of Eminent\nPersonalities to examine ways of strengthening the\nUnited Nations through institutional reforms and\nprocesses. We are looking forward to the report of the\nPanel. Nigeria \u2014 and indeed the rest of Africa \u2014 holds\nthe view that the Security Council should be expanded in\nits permanent and non-permanent categories to make it\nmore representative, more effective and more\nacceptable. We hope that those regions of the world\nthat are not currently represented in the permanent\nmembership category will be given membership.\nAfrica, whose issues occupy a substantial part of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s time, ought to be accorded priority\nconsideration for permanent membership, and Nigeria,\nI strongly believe, is a well-qualified candidate."

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the mantle\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nninth session. My delegation wishes to assure you of\nits full support and cooperation in bringing about the\nsuccessful outcome of this session.\nMy Government expresses its deepest\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for\nthe outstanding manner in which he presided over the\nwork of the fifty-eighth session. Under his visionary\nleadership, significant progress was made in advancing\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and in\nensuring the return of development to the forefront of\nthe issues addressed by the Assembly.\n15\n\nNo words of praise are adequate to describe the\nyeoman\u2019s task undertaken by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan. In an international environment of\nturmoil and a world going through the turbulence of\neconomic reconstruction as globalization proceeds, the\nSecretary-General has remained a clear, calm and\nmoderating influence on all parties to conflict. His\nlevel-headed approach has done much to ensure the\nrelevance of the United Nations, which the people of\nthe Commonwealth of Dominica cherish highly.\nThe numerous challenges facing the globalized\nworld demand a common endeavour from all the\nnations of the world. Guaranteeing human rights, peace\nand security and ensuring social and economic justice\nfor all require international cooperation and concerted\nmultilateral action.\nDominica is of the firm conviction that the\nUnited Nations continues to be the global institution\nmost suited to the pursuit and coordination of these\nglobal initiatives. The multilateral institutions,\nhowever, need to be reformed if they are going to be\nrelevant in the current global dispensation.\nThe coordination of the United Nations effort, in\nharmony with national efforts, must be the focus of this\ninstitution if it is to positively impact on the lives of\nthe majority \u2014 the vulnerable and marginalized people\nof the world.\nDominica is a small island State with all the\nstrengths, as well as the weaknesses, of countries with\nsmall economies. That is why we look to the United\nNations as a forum in which small countries can air\ntheir views, with the aim of collectively influencing the\nagenda of the Organization in some way.\nThe central question for all countries in the world\ntoday relates to the kind of arrangements that will\nconstitute the economic order when the globalization\nprocess is complete. At this stage, globalization\nconsists of a wide variety of treaties, some bilateral\nand others multilateral. From this slew of agreements,\nthere is yet to be discerned a clear set of principles that\naddress the idiosyncratic features of small island States\nwhen they function as economic units.\nWithin the past six years, the economy of my\ncountry has had to withstand a number of shocks \u2014 the\nbyproducts of multilateral treaties to which States in\nsituations similar to that of my country have had only a\nminuscule input. A dispute between the United States\nof America and the European Union resulted in a\nruling by the World Trade Organization that destroyed\nthe banana industry, which was the backbone of the\neconomy of Dominica.\nA subsequent decision by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development to publish\nwhat has been described as a \u201cblacklist\u201d had a very\nadverse impact upon the offshore banking sector in my\ncountry.\nDominica would like to make a plea for greater\ntransparency and inclusiveness in the formulation of\nagreements which relate to development financing,\ntrade and international tax matters. Participation ought\nto be substantive, not a mere formality, which is the\ncase more often than not. We do not subscribe to the\nnotion that mere presence constitutes significant\nparticipation.\nNotwithstanding our participation in multilateral\ninstitutions, the two shocks to which I referred were\nexogenous \u2014 originating outside our country and\nhaving nothing to do with the internal economic\nmanagement of Dominica. A resolute commitment on\nthe part of the resilient population of Dominica, with\nthe timely help of some friendly countries and\ninstitutions, saved our country from total disaster.\nThe lesson, which is abundantly clear to my\ncountry and to other small States, is that a new global\neconomic order must be balanced and sensitive to the\ninterests of its weakest members.\nThe situation of small island developing States\nwill be the focus of attention in January 2005, when the\nInternational Meeting to Review the Implementation of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action convenes in\nMauritius. The Barbados+10 Meeting will afford us the\nopportunity to make a full assessment of the\nProgramme of Action and to evaluate its successes and\nshortcomings.\nDominica and other small island developing\nStates attach great importance to the International\nMeeting. We hope that it will galvanize the international\ncommunity to make a greater commitment to provide\nthe critical additional resources necessary for\nadvancing the implementation obligations of the next\nphase of the Programme of Action.\nMy country is alarmed at the rise of terrorism in\nthe world. Indeed, as we move towards a more united\nworld where people of different races and colours are\n16\n\ncalled upon to demonstrate greater respect and\ntolerance for each other, violent attempts at solutions\nare counterproductive and have the unintended\nconsequence of harming mere bystanders.\nThe brutal and bloody terrorist acts of 11 September\n2001, committed in New York City, not only had\nreverberations for relatives, friends and the society in\ngeneral in which the brutal murders took place, but\nalso had serious repercussions of an economic nature\nin places quite distant from the scene of the crime.\nThat notorious event had a very deleterious effect\nupon the Dominican economy. It drastically contracted\nour tourist industry, which has yet to recover fully. The\nfocus on terrorism and the cost of complying with\nrequirements to prevent terrorist attacks in a region\nthat is renowned as a zone of peace are challenging our\ncommitment to social and economic development.\nEvery cent spent on addressing this threat is a\ncent taken from our campaign to sustain the fight\nagainst trafficking in narcotic drugs and human beings,\nthe pandemic of HIV/AIDS and other communicable\ndiseases and the degradation of our common\nenvironment. Water security, food security, energy\nsecurity and health security are other important goals\nthat stand to suffer if additional resources are not found\nto pursue them.\nConflicts in various parts of the world are\nconsuming scarce resources that are critically needed\nfor development and poverty alleviation. On the\nAfrican continent, civil conflicts in the Sudan, Burundi\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo are having\ncatastrophic consequences for the lives of large\nnumbers of people. The continuing attention and\nsupport of the international community remain\nimportant prerequisites in the pursuit of efforts towards\nconflict resolution.\nThe Government of Dominica urges an\nimmediate end to attempts to use violence as a solution\nto the problems of the people of our planet and calls\nfor a greater degree of rationality to be employed as we\naddress the very thorny problems of life today.\nWe are satisfied that the more rational approach\nthat we are suggesting can solve many problems that\nhave been in existence for generations. Prior to the\nabolition of apartheid in South Africa, no one would\nhave believed that, after years of bloodshed between\nthe races, a post-apartheid political order could have\naccommodated dialogue between the races in that\ncountry. The South African example shows that when\npersons of good-will and intellect get together\nproblems can be resolved without recourse to terror\nand violence. The United Nations has demonstrated its\ncapacity to trigger the peaceful resolution of conflicts\nin the past, and my Government is persuaded that it can\ncontinue to do so if permitted.\nI have the great honour to be the Prime Minister\nof Dominica at the age of 32. We in Dominica\nsubscribe to the view that the young people of any\ncountry are its best hope for a brighter future, to be\nachieved through constructive change. My presence\nhere attests to the commitment of the Dominican nation\nto treat younger generations not as inexperienced\nknow-nothings, but as people with the potential to\nexcel, to whom we must provide the best tools for\nensuring quality leadership. We believe that the early\nexposure of young people to leadership and positions\nof responsibility would help to accelerate the process\nfor achieving the goal of a world without prejudice.\nI have sought to summarize those issues that are\nof special concern to small, vulnerable States such as\nDominica and others in the Caribbean. In this regard, I\ncannot overstate the importance of the Assembly\ntaking cognizance of some unique features of island\nlife, particularly in the tropics.\nAs you are aware, Sir, at this time of the year,\nsmall island States in the Caribbean and parts of the\nNorth American continent are exposed to the threat of\ndevastating hurricanes. This year, major disasters have\noccurred on several islands. Unspeakable devastation\nhas taken place in Grenada; Jamaica has suffered\nsubstantial loss of life and damage to property; parts of\nthe Cayman Islands were submerged, and the death toll\nin Haiti and Santo Domingo has been horrendous. In\nthe United States of America, the state of Florida has\nexperienced disaster of immense proportions. The\nrecent experience of natural disasters underscores the\nimportance of the necessity to put in place\nrehabilitation programmes that would enable destroyed\neconomies to be revived in the minimum time.\nThe Government of Dominica believes that an\ninsurance fund should be set up under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations. States at risk of natural disasters that\ndevastate their economies ought to be able to receive\ninsurance payments to rehabilitate their economies\nwhen they are damaged by such natural disasters.\n17\n\nParticipation in such an insurance plan would not be a\ncharitable act. Each Member State would be required to\npay a premium that is affordable for that country, and\nthe funds accumulated could be used to repair damage\ndone to the economy, especially in cases where the\nproductive sector of a country\u2019s economy has been\nreduced to paralysis.\nEvents in the last year have underscored that\npeace and security in the world, social progress and\neconomic prosperity require the consensus of Member\nStates, the strict implementation of universal norms\nand commitment to multilateral action.\nIn that regard, the United Nations Stabilization\nMission in Haiti deserves the support of all Member\nStates, especially those in the Latin American and\nCaribbean region. My Government has made an\nimportant decision to support the humanitarian efforts\nto bring stability to the people of Haiti. We remain\nconvinced that only the full implementation of the\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1542 (2004)\nwill lead to the return of democratic governance in Haiti.\nDominica commends the United Nations for\nbringing visibility to the problems of the world\u2019s\nindigenous people during the International Decade of\nthe World\u2019s Indigenous People. With the impending\nend of that Decade this year, we urge the world\ncommunity to maintain the momentum of the Decade\nand renew its commitment to support the future\naspirations of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples through\ngreater contributions to the Voluntary Fund for\nIndigenous Populations.\nConsistent with the overriding principle of\npursuing universal consensus and our own national\ndevelopment goals, Dominica chose on 24 March 2004\nto act in conformity with General Assembly resolution\n2758 (XXVI) of 1971 by establishing diplomatic\nrelations with the People\u2019s Republic of China, thereby\nhonouring the one-China policy.\nDominica lauds the hand of friendship extended\nand the demonstrated commitment of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China to assisting small developing\ncountries, which are hard-pressed to fulfil their social and\neconomic agendas in the light of the adverse impact of\nthe evolving new world order on their economies.\nIn the Caribbean region, as in other regions of the\nworld, we are witnessing the devastating impact of the\nproliferation of small arms. As a consequence, crime\nrates and civil conflicts are increasing, threatening the\nstability and the security of developing countries such\nas mine. We therefore call for the early conclusion of\nthe negotiations on a legally binding international\ninstrument to control the indiscriminate supply of small\narms and light weapons to non-State actors.\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm Dominica\u2019s commitment\nto the United Nations agenda. For us, the United\nNations is the embodiment of our collective will to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Given\nthat those goals will create a new world order that the\nyoung people of the world will inherit, I urge that\ngreater numbers of youth be involved at all levels in\nthe decision-making process. That requires a massive\neducational programme to demystify international\nrelations and motivate more young people to\nparticipate and help shape their world.\nI wish delegates every success in their deliberations\nat the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "At the outset I would like to express to Member States\nmy deepest gratitude \u2014 that of the Government and\npeople of Gabon \u2014 for the great honour and the\nconfidence shown in Gabon and in Africa through the\nelection of one of its sons to the lofty post of President\nof the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We\nhave long been familiar, Mr. President, with your\ndiplomatic skills and your personal dedication to the\ncause of the United Nations system, and we have full\nconfidence that you will successfully discharge your\nduties.\nI wish to reiterate to your predecessor my sincere\ncongratulations on the work he accomplished during\nhis mandate.\nTo the Secretary-General, I wish to reaffirm my\nconfidence and the support of my country in the pursuit\nof your action heading the United Nations.\nFour years ago, we unanimously adopted the\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). With\nrenewed energy and will, we have undertaken to\nachieve a number of its goals by the year 2015: in\nparticular, to reduce poverty and hunger, to combat\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and to establish a\nglobal partnership for development.\nAchieving these goals will clearly require a\nstrong political impetus on our part. That is why I hail\nthe initiative of convening a United Nations summit\ndedicated, inter alia, to the implementation of the\nMillennium Goals, and scheduled for 2005 in New\nYork. The major disparities which come to light daily\nbetween the rich and the poor countries evoke serious\nconcern. We cannot reconcile ourselves to the despair\nwhich would result from failure. The African States,\nfor their part, reject such an inevitability; they are\nbecoming involved in the prevention and resolution of\nthe conflicts undermining their continent, are settling\ninto good governance and are making efforts to\nimplement the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\nAt the same time, the international community,\nthe Group of Eight countries and the specialized\ninstitutions of the United Nations system, including the\nBretton Woods institutions, have a moral obligation to\ntranslate into concrete action their commitments to\nsupport Africa\u2019s development. That development\nnaturally hinges on the maintenance of international\npeace and security throughout the African continent.\nOur determination in that respect is unequivocal.\nSuch is the case in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, where the peace\nprocess was relaunched at the Accra summit in July\n2004. The same holds true for the decision of the\nAfrican Union to play an active role in the resolution\nof the crises in Darfur, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\nsupport provided by the United Nations in those\ncountries and the role played by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, must be commended.\nMoreover, we welcome the prospects for a more\neffective contribution by the United Nations in the\nprocess of the reconstruction of Iraq and support for\nthe political transition under way there. It is indeed\nvital for regional stability and for peace that Iraq once\nagain become a normally functioning State with stable\ninstitutions.\nIn the lengthy conflict between the State of Israel\nad the Palestinian people, the restoration of lasting\npeace will be possible only at the negotiating table. It\nalso depends on the reactivation of the road map.\nIn this case, as in many others, such as the war on\ninternational terrorism, United Nations action must be\nmore effective. The decisions of the Security Council\nwill then be decisive in the settlement of such\nconflicts.\nGiven the numerous crisis situations throughout\nthe world, the role of the Security Council in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\ncontinued to grow. Its field of action, in terms of its\ndecisions, has gradually expanded, and the human,\nmaterial and financial resources required for their\nimplementation have increased.\nTo cope with these situations, a significant\nnumber of States must participate in its action. That\nrequires an expansion of the membership of the\nSecurity Council, in both categories \u2014 permanent and\nnon-permanent.\n16\n\nNeed I recall that in 1977, from this very rostrum,\nI drew the Organization\u2019s attention to the need to\nprovide a seat for Africa in the Security Council. It is\nindeed paradoxical that Africa is still not counted\namong the permanent members, even though the bulk\nof the Council\u2019s decisions directly involve Africa. We\ntherefore must adapt the Security Council to the\nchanging realities of our world. Its reform must be\ngiven high priority at this session.\nBeyond that, our efforts at reform must have as\ntheir ultimate objective the strengthening of the action\nof the entire United Nations system in the areas\nidentified during the Millennium Summit in 2000.\nStriving to achieve these shared goals, Africa is\nincreasingly shouldering its share of responsibility.\nShared and intensive solidarity on the part of countries\nwith greater resources is more than ever required. What\nis at stake today is the survival of millions of\nindividuals throughout the world.\nPoverty \u2014 one of the root causes of political,\neconomic and social instability, which are sources of\narmed conflict \u2014 must be eradicated.\nTherefore, we must implement, here and now, the\ncommitment we have undertaken to change the course\nof our shared history. Let us together nurture the hope\nof a better destiny \u2014 the hope that we can think and\nact in a different manner, in order to provide present\nand future generations with genuine reasons for hope."

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that I congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election to preside over\nthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, an\nelection that offers Africa its tenth presidency. The\nGabonese Republic thus has received from the\ninternational community the recognition it deserves\nand the French-speaking countries are delighted to see\none of our own guiding our debates. Be assured that\nthe delegation of Monaco, which I am leading, will\nfully support you in your noble mission in the service\nof peace and development. I would also like to hail the\nSecretary-General for his courage and his unwavering\ncommitment to peace.\nA long time ago, the Organization began a\nprocess of thinking through the reforms that are\nrequired to improve its functioning. In that connection,\nI would like to congratulate the outgoing President of\nthe Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, on his work during the\nfifty-eighth session; his perseverance made possible\nthe adoption of new measures to revitalize the work of\nthe General Assembly. While welcoming that progress,\nwe know that we must continue along that path.\nDedication to democracy and to the rule of law,\nunswerving confidence in the virtues of multilateralism\nand respect for our differences allow us to move\nforward in a spirit of harmony and to continue to adapt\nthe Organization to meet the challenges of our time. It\nis vital that the Organization be provided with the\nmeans to better respond to the expectations of the\npeoples of the world.\nThis is why the Principality supports initiatives\naimed at improving the Organization\u00eds methods of\nwork and, in particular, those regarding Security\nCouncil reform. Enlargement of the Council, in both\npermanent and non-permanent seats, will strengthen its\ncapacity to contribute to the essential objectives of the\nmaintenance of peace by providing more equitable\nrepresentation of the diverse regions that compose the\ninternational community.\nThe fifteenth International AIDS Conference,\nheld in Thailand last July, once again highlighted the\ndevastation caused by this terrible pandemic as well as\nits disastrous social consequences. However, the\nConference also demonstrated that when international\norganizations, Governments and civil society agree to\nwork together, we can fight this scourge more\neffectively. In that struggle, the role of women is\ncrucial. In my country, Her Serene Highness Princess\nStephanie, my sister, created and chairs the Fight AIDS\nMonaco association that gives moral and material\nsupport to AIDS patients and their families while\npromoting information and prevention programmes.\nFor my part, I have expressed the wish that all of\nthe Principality's school children participate in marking a\n23\n\nworld day for children orphaned by AIDS, to show\ntheir solidarity with these vulnerable children whose\nnumber could reach 100 million by the year 2010.\nOnce again this year, my country has been\ncontributing to the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which was created following\nthe twenty-sixth special session of the General\nAssembly, the first to be devoted to a disease. We have\nbeen providing regular support for the activities of the\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\n(UNAIDS) since its creation, and I am pleased to\nannounce that the Principality has decided to\nstrengthen its financial cooperation with the\nProgramme. We hope that the creation within UNAIDS\nof the Programme Acceleration Fund will allow us to\nmeet specific needs defined by the recipient States\nthemselves. In effect, we are convinced of the necessity\nfor States to strengthen, on the one hand, their\ncapacities in terms of basic social services and\nadequate sanitation facilities and on the other hand, to\npursue public awareness and information campaigns.\nUpon the initiative of His Serene Highness the\nSovereign Prince, my father, the Principality of\nMonaco has always expressed its solidarity to the most\nunderdeveloped populations. We share the concerns of\nworld leaders regarding the adverse impact that the\npersistence of extreme poverty is having on\ninternational security.\nWe shall therefore consider most carefully the\nelaboration of a new global partnership designed to\neliminate hunger and poverty and to advance economic\ndevelopment and social justice, as a continuation to the\ncommitments undertaken at the Millennium Summit\nand during the Monterrey Conference.\nTerrorism, unfortunately, has become a daily\nreality, as is attested to by, among others, the tragedy\nthat took place in Beslan, which is repugnant to all of\nus. Our determination to fight it must remain unshaken\nand that is why we welcome the establishment of an\nexecutive directorate of the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. In that domain, international cooperation is\nan essential element for effective action. No State,\nregardless of its size, can be a weak link that might\nendanger the efforts we are conducting together.\nTherefore, the Principality intends to play its role\nin the battle which our Organization is waging against\nterrorism. Thus, Monaco has become a party to all of the\ntwelve conventions designed to eradicate international\nterrorism and has adopted, as domestic legislation,\nappropriate measures for their implementation.\nBut the battle against terrorism also requires that\nwe act irreproachably in terms of our respect for\nhuman rights. Accordingly, the Principality is making\nevery effort to guarantee them on its territory; hence\nMonaco\u00eds forthcoming accession to the Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen.\nThe number of refugees and displaced persons\nwho are displaced within their own countries continues\nto increase, and our response to the unbearable\nsuffering of those human beings cannot be limited to\nour moral indignation. As in any urgent and complex\nemergency situation, civilians and the most vulnerable\namong them are the targets of harm and the worst types\nof abuse. The humanitarian disaster which continues to\ntake place under our very eyes in Darfur has shown,\nonce again, how limited we are in our capacity to\nenforce respect for human rights and for international\nhumanitarian law.\nIn response to the appeal launched by the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) during the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on children in 2002, the authorities\nof Monaco decided to earmark their traditional\ncontribution to UNHCR towards primary education for\nrefugee children. We hope to provide those children,\nwhose world has been brutally shattered overnight, a\nsubstitute for their traditional educational environment,\nby allowing them to escape, albeit a little, those terrible\nconditions of daily life dominated by promiscuity and\nthe anguish of having forever lost their homes.\nChampioning the interests of the child has always\nbeen one of our major concerns. To build a world fit\nfor children, in keeping with the commitments\nundertaken during the May 2002 special session on\nchildren, the World Association of Children\u00eds Friends,\npresided over by my sister, Her Royal Highness the\nPrincess of Hanover, organized in the Principality in\nApril 2003, a round table on that subject.\nUnfortunately, the need is becoming clearer each day,\nto strengthen the area of international law designed to\nguarantee the rights of children and to assure that those\nlaws are more effectively applied.\nThus, do not those particularly heinous crimes\nrequire an exceptionally strong response? Do we not\nneed to ensure that the most serious violations of the\n24\n\nrights of children do not fall under a statute of\nlimitations and do we not need to extend the powers of\nthe national jurisdictions by providing them with\nuniversal competence in that area?\nThe Principality of Monaco urges you to give\nthought to this, in other words, to plan for the adoption\nof a legal instrument which will make it possible here,\nto react against the impunity which continues to\nprevail, concerning the enrolment of child soldiers, the\nsexual exploitation of children and the despicable trade\nof which they are victims - to mention only the most\nrevolting of those crimes.\nThe debate held last June in the Security Council\nserved to reaffirm the timely nature of such\nconsiderations. By abolishing the statute of limitations\nfor those horrendous crimes, we would be\nstrengthening their prevention, as well as fulfilling our\nduty to honour the memory of the victims. By\nexpanding the competences of our national\njurisdictions so that borders no longer serve to limit\nour actions, we will be better able to cope with the\ndevelopment of the transnational organized crime\nnetwork which defies our States and the legal order\nthey are trying to establish.\nI am fully aware that this essentially moral\nstruggle - to ensure respect for the rights of the\nchild - gives rise, given the present state of\ninternational law, to numerous legal difficulties. But is\nit not our duty to act when that legislation is no longer\nadapted to meet the challenges of our time, at a time\nwhen the international community is clearly closing its\nunified ranks, to put an end to those practices which\nare abhorrent to all of us?\nLet us be courageous and foresighted in\nchampioning the most noble cause that exists - the\ndefence of innocents. Let us respond to the appeal of\nAlbert Einstein made so long ago that - there will be\nno progress in this world as long as there are unhappy\nchildren."

        "file_text": "A decade ago\nI was elected the Head of Government of my country.\nIt was 1994, a time of hope for the world and for the\nOrganization of the United Nations. The collapse of the\ncommunist system and the iron curtain and the\nappearance of new democracies in the world, combined\nwith a positive economic outlook enabled us to\nimagine a better future for humankind in the twenty-\nfirst century.\nTen years later, we are living with considerable\nconcern in a world that is becoming more and more\nviolent, in which terrorist attacks are met with a\nmilitary response and those military responses seem to\ngenerate new terrorist attacks. It would seem that we\nare caught up in a terrible settling of scores and in a\nspiral of hate, fanaticism and senseless bloodshed.\nEvery day, the media shows images of innocent people\nand soldiers losing their lives in those conflicts. The\nstakes continue to rise, yet the cause of world peace\nseems increasingly vulnerable. The almost\ninstantaneous arrival in every home of images of the\nmost dramatic events taking place everywhere is even\nbecoming banal.\nThe privilege of being able to come so many\ntimes to the Assembly on behalf of my country has\nproduced in me states of mind that have gone from\ninitial curiosity and the wish to know and learn to a\nmuch more sceptical phase, by way of periods in which\nlarge question marks were placed on the role we are all\nplaying in this game.\nWe want to be positive and optimistic and not to\nbetray the heritage of peace, harmony and open\nwelcome that are the essence of the life of the\nAndorrans, both women and men. But it must be\nadmitted that it is becoming more and more difficult to\nthink in that way and to believe that the principles that\ninspired, for example, the founding of the United\nStates of America, can still prevail.\nThat is because the notion of pre-emptive war has\nnow shaken us all. The principle of attacking before\none is attacked is no new invention. But it had seemed\nto be a tribal memory or a type of behaviour belonging\nto other, none too remote times in the history of Europe\nitself.\nThe big questions are: what justifies a pre-\nemptive attack? Which country or countries pose a\nsufficient threat to allow taking such a risk? Why\nattack one country and not another, perhaps equally\ndangerous one? Are the sufferings of some people\nmore meaningful than the sufferings of others, and\nconsequently more deserving of action? Should the\nconventions of international law be cast aside by\n36\n\nMembers of the United Nations, as they are by lawless\nterrorists?\nWhat I would like to do today is reflect on the\nthings we can learn from the past that can guide us\ntowards a more promising and safer future.\nFor countries with a deep respect and admiration\nfor the history of freedom of the United States \u2014 and\nAndorra counts itself among those countries \u2014 it is a\nsource of consternation to note that the doctrine of pre-\nemptive attack has generated a level of distrust among\nGovernments and peoples. After the worldwide\noutpouring of sympathy following the terrorist attacks\non New York and Washington, that changed perception\nis profoundly troubling.\nNeither can anyone claim that sympathy is\nenough. Worldwide sympathy was the reaction to the\nattacks on New York and Washington. We, the people\nof Andorra, were very directly affected by the attacks\nin Madrid six months ago. Very recently, Russia has\nbeen added to the list of disasters. But sympathy alone\ncannot break the cycle of fear and violence.\nWe need to address the causes of terrorism and\ncomprehend the forces that give it power in order to\nrespond together in compliance with the rule of law.\nTomorrow, my country will deposit instruments of\nratification for four conventions against terrorism, and\nthe rest are scheduled to be ratified in the coming year.\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\ntook the Chair.\nWe cannot allow terrorism to unbind the rule of\nlaw, since that would mean undoing the tissue of\ncivilized behaviour, which serves as a safety net in\nmodern culture. Instead of isolating one nation from\nanother, instead of moralizing and self-serving political\nposturing, instead of giving in to fear, we must\nrecognize that our common vulnerability goes hand in\nhand with a humanity that we also share.\nHelping every member of the international\ncommunity to realize that what happens to others can\nalso happen to us creates a basis for tolerance and\nunderstanding. How much stronger we, all the\ncountries represented at the United Nations, could\nbecome in the fight against terrorism if we truly acted\ntogether. A Security Council strengthened by a\ncommon will to root out terrorism could do much more\nthan individual actions supported by a few\nGovernments.\nWe must give back to the United Nations its sense\nof determination and help it to help us all in the\ncrucially important fight against terrorism. I call in\nparticular on the States that are permanent members of\nthe Security Council to think long and hard about what\nthey can achieve together, with the support of all other\nUnited Nations Member States, to preserve\ninternational order and models of civilized behaviour,\nwhich this Organization represents and which it has\ntaken humankind so many millenniums of suffering\nand progress to achieve.\nIn this context, Andorra would support an\nincrease \u2014 up to 24 \u2014 in the number of members of\nthe Security Council so as to guarantee a more accurate\nrepresentation of the reality of today\u2019s world in that\nimportant decision-making body.\nI believe that the energy that feeds the cycle of\nviolence is the result of the abstractions behind which\nwe hide \u2014 abstractions of nation, religion or race. We\nhide our vulnerability behind a kind of rigid certainty\nor moral righteousness. Ignorance and the\nunwillingness to recognize differences give rise to\nxenophobia and racism.\nThere is not much use in wondering now if the\nresults would have been different, and the dangers\nfacing us today less severe, if different policies had\nbeen applied after the criminal and unforgivable\nattacks of 11 September 2001; if the peace process in\nIsrael and Palestine had been more successful; or if we\nin the United Nations had been able to play a different\nrole. Granted, our response, as the United Nations, to\nother international crises has been imperfect, and we\nare constantly striving to rectify the way in which we\napproach such issues. But the results have been\ninvaluable. Our efforts averted worse bloodbaths,\ngreater harm to the oppressed and ever more extreme\ntrauma and despair.\nWhat good is this Organization if we lack the\nwisdom and moral strength to attempt to reconcile our\nfellow nations? How could we continue to hope for\npeace and justice in the world if the United Nations\nceased to press forward with its mission?\nAndorra has never been a wealthy country,\nthough its inhabitants have always been free. In this\nrespect, we have a privileged history. Other nations\nhave endured greater privations and fratricidal wars,\nhave lost customs and traditions and have had its\ncitizens flee into exile.\n37\n\nConscious of the moral debt which we owe to\nothers, three years ago we proposed to increase our\ndevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of our budget\nfor next year. Although that represents a great effort for\nus, as a small country, I am happy to inform the\nAssembly that that commitment will be honoured. I am\nalso sure that my successor as head of Government will\ncontinue to increase Andorra\u2019s contribution to the\nobjectives of development until we reach 0.7 per cent\nof gross domestic product. We will also become a\nmember of the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations and help to make its worthy\nmission a reality.\nWe live in a world of limited resources and\nopportunities. Competition for them is increasing with\nthe growth of globalization. The worst outcome of the\ninevitable future competition would be increasingly\nviolent demands on the part of one nation or another.\nYet the essential issues facing us are not restricted to\njust one part of the world; nor can they be defined in\nterms of the advantages or interests of a single nation.\nPreserving the environment and maintaining a strong\nglobal economy, dignified standards of living and safe\nand peaceful political relationships all require a\nconcerted effort.\nThe task will not be easy. It will require all the\ncourage, energy, diplomatic talent and communication\nskills that we can bring to bear. Our joint task has\nnever been as important as in the coming year.\nYesterday, I listened carefully to the words of the\nSecretary-General, who set a very high standard for all\nin his opening speech. I would like sincerely to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for the courage of\nhis words. I have heard many impressive speeches in\nthis Hall over the past 10 years. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s statement yesterday was the best, by far, of\nall of them.\nAlthough Andorra joined the United Nations just\n10 years ago, our country is not a new one. Quite the\ncontrary \u2014 the Principality of Andorra is one of the\noldest and most peaceful nations in the world. Our\nfrontiers have not changed for centuries, and we have\npractised parliamentary democracy for over half of that\ntime. In fact, we have had uninterrupted peace since\n1278.\nIn the thirteenth century, during the violent period\nof the Cathar heresies, which created upheaval in our\npart of the world, two powerful lords \u2014 the Count of\nFoix in the north and the Bishop of Urgell in the\nsouth \u2014 managed to overcome religious and political\ndifferences to negotiate an agreement which made the\nAndorran State possible. Through the 1993\nconstitution, we keep their successors \u2014 the President\nof the French Republic and the Bishop of Urgell \u2014 as\nour heads of State in a personal, joint and indivisible\nmanner. The continued existence of Andorra over the\ncenturies has, indeed, been the result of a skilful and\nconstant will to negotiate between our people and their\npowerful neighbours.\nThe democratic process which began with the\nsetting up of the Council of the Land in 1419 was\nessential for our survival as a free community.\nAlthough conflicts have also threatened Andorra\nduring its history, mutual understanding has protected\nus better than have the high peaks of the mountains\nwhich surround us or the rigorous winters which\nisolate us from the outside world for weeks and weeks\nat a time. When I read Andorran documents from past\ncenturies, I recognize how deeply ideas of\nindependence and respect for others have guaranteed\nour well-being and our security.\nGiven the bloody course of European history\nduring previous millenniums, we hold this as a\nremarkable accomplishment. We have never had an\narmy, nor have we produced one single offensive\nweapon of any type. Our only weapon has been the\nwisdom and prudence of our forebears, who had the\ngood sense to keep out of all neighbouring conflicts.\nThat good sense has been inherited by the new\ngenerations of young Andorrans \u2014 women and men\nwho are very well prepared for the world of today,\nopen to knowledge of new technology and full of\nlegitimate pride in being members of a small State in\nwhich they have every chance of being the main agents\nof their future, but who are, at the same time,\nperplexed by the growth of new religious fanaticism\nand exclusiveness and by the return of old fanaticisms,\nwhich we had considered forgotten.\nAt this, the dawn of a new era, we must pass on\nto them the trust which we have placed in the United\nNations and in the supremacy of law over force. This\nour fathers taught us, and this our children must learn\nif they are to be worthy members of humankind."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the\noutset, I have the pleasure to extend my most sincere\ncongratulations and best wishes to you and your\nfriendly country of Gabon on the occasion of your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session and to wish you every success in\nyour work. May I take this opportunity to thank your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte, Minister\nof Foreign Affairs of the friendly country of Saint\nLucia, for the intensive efforts he exerted during his\npresidency of the last session.\nI also would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress my country\u2019s appreciation to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan for the great efforts he has made to\nenhance and strengthen the role of the United Nations\nin maintaining international peace and security.\nSince the signing of the Charter in 1945 in San\nFrancisco, the United Nations has played a vital role in\naddressing many international political, economic,\nsocial and humanitarian issues.\nOur world today is witnessing the interlinking of\ndifferent issues in politics and in regional and\ninternational security with other issues of development,\nthe environment, culture, women and human rights. As\na result, international interests have become\ninterwoven and the distinction between local and\ninternational questions has almost vanished in light of\nthe spread of globalization. People need the United\nNations now more than they did a half a century ago.\nWith newly developed understanding, they have a\ngreater day-to-day need to keep up with the modern\ndevelopments of the twenty-first century and the spirit\nof the age, led by multilateral diplomacy, which looks\nat both present and inherited problems from a new\npractical perspective and understanding. The idea of\nreforming the United Nations, including the collective\nsecurity system, is indeed an ambitious one. However,\nwe believe that its implementation is not an impossible\ndream but a necessity. The international community\nmust respond, through innovative thinking, practical\nmethods and a collective determination, in order to\nachieve democracy in international relations, maintain\nthe spirit of the Charter, and devise practical solutions\nto national and regional conflicts and mitigate their\nconsequences for the development process in Member\nStates.\nIn that context, we would like to reiterate our\nsupport for the efforts made by the Secretary-General\nto reform the Organization and enhance its capacity to\nshoulder its responsibilities and carry out it missions.\nWe look forward with great interest to the report\nthat the Secretary-General will present in December on\nthe outcome of the meetings of the High-Level Panel\non Threats, Challenges and Change. We hope that these\nresults and recommendations will not only meet the\nhopes of the peoples of the world but will also be\nsufficient to address the threats and problems that beset\ninternational relations on all sides.\nAs reform and modernization of the United\nNations have become a goal for the majority of its\nMembers, by the same token, leaders and political\nexperts in many parts of the world, including the Arab\nworld, have become aware that reform and\nmodernization are important issues in their societies in\norder to address the demands for change and the\nmovement of history, and that these issues must be\naddressed with clear-sightedness and wisdom, to meet\n25\n\nthe hopes and aspirations of the new generation for\nprogress and democratization.\nAs a result of that historic political awareness, the\nreform and democratization process has made great\nstrides in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Bahrain has moved\nrapidly in the building of democracy and the widening\nof popular participation since the adoption of the\nNational Action Charter by the people of Bahrain on\n14 February 2001, and municipal and parliamentary\nelections in 2002.\nIt is clear that the call for reform and\ndemocratization, which has become an important\ncontemporary element in international policy, has\nbecome a demand of both industrialized countries and\nof many developing countries as well. This year, the\nPresident of the Group of Eight invited His Majesty\nKing Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, the King of Bahrain,\nto participate in its annual Summit held in Georgia,\nUnited States, from 8 to 10 June last, in recognition of\nHis Majesty\u2019s important role in the reform process and\nthe building of democracy in Bahrain.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism is a source of\nconcern for the international community, because of its\nhorrific spread to many different parts of the world.\nIndeed, no region or country is immune. In that regard,\nBahrain reaffirms its condemnation of terrorism in all\nits forms and manifestations, regardless of its sources\nor motivation. We reassert that there can be no\njustification whatsoever for terrorism, and that terrorist\nacts are not condoned by any religion or belief.\nBahrain has condemned, and continues to\ncondemn, terrorist acts against countries and peoples\nthrough which innocent lives are lost, and reaffirms its\nsolidarity with the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nand its support for all measures it has taken to\novercome these criminal actions, which contradict the\nprinciples and tenets of Islam, a religion of tolerance\nand mercy. Bahrain also condemns and denounces all\nterrorist acts around the world, including the events at\nthe school in Beslan, North Ossetia, in Russia.\nIn examining terrorism and its threats, it is\nnecessary to review its causes in order to limit its\ndestructive danger. Among those causes, we find\npoverty, ignorance, backwardness, unemployment, a\nculture of extremism, fundamentalism, ethnic\nprejudice, feelings of national desperation and\nfrustration, and violations of human rights.\nTo address this terrorist phenomenon, and within\nthe framework of regional and international cooperation\nto fight it, Bahrain and the other countries of the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) this year signed the GCC\nAnti-Terrorism Agreement, a further step in\novercoming this scourge, which must be eradicated.\nIsrael is increasing its oppressive measures and\npractices in the occupied territories against the\nPalestinian people. It does not respect or comply with\ninternational law and international legality by taking\nareas of Palestinian land in its construction of the so-\ncalled barrier, which consolidates the occupation and\nthe settlements, and extinguishes hopes for an\nindependent Palestinian State \u2014 the legal and\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people.\nThe international community today must take a\ncourageous stand in the face of these actions, in\nparticular following the advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice delivered on 9 July 2004,\nand General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July\n2004, which represent a triumph for international\nlegality and a clear condemnation of the building of the\nseparation wall, which contradicts the principles of\ninternational law. The international community must\nuse that opinion to pressure Israel to end its occupation\nof all Palestinian and Arab territories, including the\nSyrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese Shaba\u2019a Farms.\nThe Arab countries reaffirm their commitment to\nthe Arab peace initiative agreed at the Beirut Summit\nin 2002, and reaffirmed by the most recent Arab\nSummit in Tunis in 2004, which calls for a complete\nIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab land and the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State with\nJerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the\nresolutions of international legality, in particular\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973),\n1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003).\nWe call once again on the Quartet to resume its\nefforts to promote the peace process, and we demand\nthat the Government of Israel fulfil its obligations\nunder the peace plan, as set out in the road map.\nThe situation in brotherly Iraq remains a continued\nsource of concern for the countries and peoples of the\nregion, in particular the violence and insecurity that\nthreaten it, despite continued efforts to maintain peace,\nespecially following the establishment of the Interim\nGovernment, which took office on 28 June 2004, and\nin spite of the transfer of sovereignty to Iraqi\n26\n\nauthorities, the convening of the national conference\nand steps taken towards the creation of an interim\nNational Legislative Council.\nThe upcoming stage requires that a vital and\neffective role be played by the international community,\nrepresented by the United Nations, which will bear the\nheavy burden of supporting the interim Iraqi\nGovernment and helping it to fulfil the tasks required\nof it under Security Council resolution 1546 (2004).\nBahrain has on more than one occasion expressed\nits support for efforts to maintain peace and security in\nIraq, and to create the conditions for the reconstruction\nof the country and the maintenance of its unity. It also\nreaffirmed its willingness to participate in Arab and\ninternational efforts to rebuild Iraq and to maintain its\nunity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nThe security and stability of the Arab Gulf region\nis a matter of great concern to the Government of\nBahrain, which is constantly seeking peace and\nstability in a region that has suffered greatly during the\npast three decades. The Kingdom of Bahrain, which is\na member of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council, calls\nupon the Islamic Republic of Iran to work to peacefully\nresolve the issue of the islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser\nTunb and Abu Musa, which belong to the United Arab\nEmirates, either through serious bilateral negotiations\naimed at an agreement between the two neighbouring\ncountries or by arbitration.\nGiven the Kingdom of Bahrain\u2019s follow-up of\nefforts to achieve peace and reconciliation and to re-\nestablish stability in important regions of the Arab\nworld, we welcomed the Naivasha Agreement between\nthe Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People\u2019s\nLiberation Army. We are anxious to see an end to the\ncivil war there, which has taken a great toll in terms of\nhuman life and material resources. Bahrain also\nwelcomed the agreement between the Sudan and the\nUnited Nations aimed at ending the bloodshed in the\nDarfur region, as well as the steps taken by the\nSudanese Government to implement its obligations in\naccordance with the agreement that it signed with the\nSecretary-General on 3 July.\nBahrain also expresses its support for the efforts\nof the African Union, which is working with the\nSudanese Government with a view to resolving the\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur. We affirm the\nimportance of respecting the Sudan\u2019s sovereignty,\nindependence and territorial integrity. We call on the\nSecurity Council to give the Government of the Sudan\nsufficient time to deal with the crisis and offer the\nnecessary financial assistance to bring it to an end.\nMr. Khan (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nToday more than ever we are committed to the\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. We now have a\ndeeper understanding of the need for a modernized and\nmore advanced Organization that is capable of taking\npart in collective international action, of responding to\nthe changes and challenges of the twenty-first century\nand of ensuring greater democracy in international\nrelations, equal rights among the peoples of the world\nand equal sovereignty among States. It must also be\nable to arrive at solutions for problems that may occur\nin the future on the basis of international partnership,\nso that any as yet unforeseen challenges facing\nhumanity in the coming decades can be dealt with.\nPast mistakes and current failures should not\ndivert us from our ambitions for a better future \u2014 a\nfuture free from the scourge of war, a future of peace\nand justice, where human rights and the dignity of the\nindividual are respected; a future where resources are\ndeveloped and where society can progress, where greed\nhas been eliminated and where countries cooperate\nwithin an advanced international order that promotes\nthe rule of law and disseminates the values of human\nrights, generosity and justice, without prejudice,\narrogance or discrimination."

        "file_text": "Today our continent is experiencing a time of great\nopportunity, yet it is also beset by serious threats,\nincluding a falling standard of living for the masses,\nradical adjustment measures, the globalization of\nfinancial capital and a lack of access to markets in\ndeveloped countries - all of which have not\ncontributed to generating sustained economic growth,\nand even less to reducing poverty and inequality. The\ngreat challenge before us is to redouble our efforts\ndaily to eradicate this cancer by strengthening public\ninstitutions and forging a new social ethic, as well as a\nnew international order with multilateral bodies that\ntruly contribute to peace throughout the world, human\ndevelopment and the sharp reduction of poverty, social\ninequalities and the exploitation of man by man and\nnation by nation.\nThe United Nations, this noble institution, must\nnot lose sight of its historic memory, its raison d\u00ed\u00cdtre\nand the objectives that led to its creation, if its efforts\ncurrently under way are to result in healthy attitude\nchanges and a greater political capacity to institute\nregulatory frameworks that can put a stop to economic\nDarwinism and conflicts throughout the world.\nToday, more than ever, the possibility of building\na more just world, free from such painful\ncontradictions, depends upon the inclusion of the less\ndeveloped countries in the globalized economy and the\npolitical will to overcome pure market forces. The\nindustrialization of the United States, Germany and\nJapan in the nineteenth century could be described in\nsimilar terms, as could their emergence from their\nrelative backwardness compared with Great Britain,\nthe pioneer nation of that time.\nThe failure throughout almost all of Latin\nAmerica to overcome its backwardness, poverty and\ndependency is frequently due to selfishness and\nhistoric impediments to advantageous connections\nbetween our national economies and the worldwide\nmarket. If this seems to be a recurrent condition, then\nwe should constantly keep in mind the message of the\nConsensus of Brazil: we must govern globalization if\nwe are to turn it into a source of opportunity for all, if\nglobalization is not to be what it has become \u00f3 a force\nsynonymous with marginalization, exclusion or\nconquest, dependent on markets and cheap labour,\nwhich leads to a form of semi-slavery in many\ncountries.\nI wish to propose to the General Assembly joint\naction that can be taken in four areas.\nFirst, social investment throughout the continent\nmust reach levels that will make it possible to attain\nthe Millennium Development Goals. To that end, the\npoorest countries, which clearly cannot obtain such\nlevels of investment, could have recourse to a\ncounterpart fund for social equity with soft financing\ncoming from international organizations and unilateral\ncontributions.\nSecondly, we realize that not everything can be\nsolved with money. Money, when it is misused,\nweakens and corrupts. Accordingly, we must also\ncommit ourselves to carrying out the necessary\ninstitutional reforms to ensure the proper formulation,\nimplementation and assessment of social policies. And\nwe must be ready to ensure that access to the\naforementioned funds will lead to wide-reaching\ninnovations in the management of public\nadministration, demonstrable by means of indices on\nefficiency and transparency.\nThirdly, international organizations must\nincreasingly realize that economic and social reform\nmust flow from the experience and wisdom of those\ncountries themselves, with their own formulas that are\nin keeping with their cultural standards and that\ninvolve all the representatives of civil society.\nFourthly, with growing levels of poverty it is\nimpossible to meet the burden of external debt\nservicing. There must be a new, realistic policy that\nwill put forward rational terms on future payment of\ndebt, terms that will make it possible to lay the basis\nfor sustained and equitable development, terms which\nallow us to meet our commitments without pushing our\n19\n\npeople into irreversible poverty. It is important to place\nthe needs of the poor and dispossessed over the\nrepayment of the debt.\nThat is why we must imaginatively and skilfully\ndevise alternative financing mechanisms for the fight\nagainst hunger and extreme poverty. That task requires\ngreater intellectual resources and technical expertise\nand a new and fair financial architecture, not the\naccumulation of wealth, worship of the market or the\npromotion of globalization that does not allow the just\ndistribution of the wealth produced by all of us\nthroughout the world. We need a new financial\narchitecture that enables us to reduce poverty and to\nwork for the stability of the world\u00eds emerging\ndemocracies.\nOne year ago, my Government inherited a\nsituation characterized by economic stagnation,\nrecession and spreading poverty and by weak and\nunreliable public institutions, resulting in timid social\npolicies that could hardly tackle the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nTwo major challenges face my country. First, the\nindigenous population - which in Paraguay is not\nlarge, totalling no more than 100,000 - lacks access to\nits most vital needs and faces the disintegration of\nmuch of its natural lands owing to the historical rule of\nindolent landowners, and most recently to a type of\nagrarian modernization that was insensitive to human\ndignity.\nSecondly, the unconscionable face of extreme\npoverty in my country is that of the peasants. Today,\ntwo out of three Paraguayans continue to belong to that\nsocial sector. Likewise, one of the most significant\ncauses of that critical national problem is the very\nunjust distribution of land that has existed for many\nyears in Paraguay. That is not only an urgent and very\nshocking social problem, but also a political and\nethical problem that is manifested in a repeated and\nincreasingly grave struggle for land.\nIn the light of that situation, we propose a State\nwith social, fiscal and environmental responsibility:\nsocial responsibility in the sense of guaranteeing\nhealth, education and basic services and avoiding\nconcentration of profit and wealth; fiscal responsibility\nto avoid a deficit and chronic indebtedness, which\nultimately punish social investment; and environmental\nresponsibility to preserve nature\u00eds reproductive\ncapacity and to ensure for future generations the right\nto enjoy resources not created by man.\nWe also propose the implementation of a national\nanti-poverty strategy that will channel the domestic and\nexternal resources necessary to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. The national Government has\ndefined as a top budget priority an increase in social\nspending to resolutely address the problems of poverty,\ndestitution and inequality, with the objective of\nreaching 40 per cent of the central administration\u00eds\ntotal public spending for next year, 2005.\nFor development, cooperation is not enough;\nthere must also be access to markets on preferential\nterms, liberalization of the agricultural product markets\nand special treatment for the landlocked least\ndeveloped countries, such as Paraguay, punished by\nhistory and geopolitics, which make our foreign trade\nmore expensive and significantly reduce our\ncompetitiveness. There needs to be a compensatory\nframework to place my country, Paraguay, on an equal\nfooting with other nations in terms of international\ntrade.\nIn the international context, we join in the appeal\nfor a more just and humanized international order in\nwhich the least developed are not always condemned to\ndiscrimination, indifference and backwardness. With\nthat objective, we must move towards an inclusive\nmultilateralism that will offer equality, rationality and\njustice in international relations.\nSimilarly \u00f3 and in keeping with Paraguay\u00eds\nposition on Taiwan in the United Nations \u00f3 we once\nmore reaffirm our conviction that the brotherly\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, should become a full-\nfledged Member of the Organization, in accordance\nwith the principle of universality and with norms of\ninternational law.\nToday we have heard more of the same things we\nhear every year in the Assembly. But we hope that this\ntime we can return to our countries and share with our\npeoples the news that finally, in New York, the world\u00eds\nleaders have taken important steps forward in\nalleviating - even if just a little - the pain, sorrow\nand hopelessness of the millions of human beings who\nlive on Earth. I am confident that God will give us the\nwisdom and the strength necessary to lead our\ncountries on the path of freedom, peace, development\nand justice."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow\nme to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-ninth session.\nThe United Nations has long stood for the loftiest\naspirations and the noblest causes of mankind. In times\nof strife, it is the United Nations that holds out the\nhope of harmony. In times of deprivation and suffering,\nit is the United Nations that holds out the hope of\nhealing.\nAfter almost 60 years, however, this\nOrganization, on which we pin so much hope, finds\nitself in the midst of an existential crisis. In a world\never more complex and less predictable, the United\nNations has been struggling to redefine its meaning,\nidentity and relevance for the era of globalization. To\nconfront those new realities and more, no challenge\nwill be greater than making the United Nations a more\neffective Organization for the times. No challenge will\nbe greater than living up to the highest ideals of the\nUnited Nations with more action and fewer words.\nOur United Nations locomotive is powered by the\ncommitment and good will of its Members. It can take\nus as far as we want to go, but only if we all pull\ntogether. It can take us at any speed, but only if the\npower of commitment and good will is fully energized.\nFor whatever it is and for whatever it will be, the\nUnited Nations is the creation of its Members. So, in\ndemanding more of the United Nations, we must also\ndemand more of ourselves. And in asking the United\nNations to do more, we must also be ready to be\ncommitted more.\nThe task ahead of us all is to make sure that all\nconcerted efforts are made nationally, regionally and\nglobally to advance the causes the United Nations\nstands for and to restore total confidence in the\nworking of multilateralism. Multilateralism cannot\nthrive or sustain without foundation. The foundation of\nthe United Nations and its multilateralism may be its\n191 Member States, but what bond binds the 191\nMember States to the United Nations multilateral\nsystem?\nThe world\u2019s strategic, political and economic\nlandscape of the twenty-first century is certainly far\ndifferent, more complex and more intertwined than that\nof 1945. The layers of interwoven fibre that support\nsuch a multilateral institution as the United Nations\nmust be modified and strengthened. It is Thailand\u2019s\nbelief that, given today\u2019s international landscape, there\nis a greater need than ever to create new layers of\nregional and subregional building blocks to strengthen\nthe United Nations multilateral foundation. Those\nbuilding blocks are the bond that binds nations to the\nmultilateral system.\nIn so doing, those regional and subregional\nbuilding blocks must bear the responsibility of\nsupporting and advancing the United Nations goals on\nsecurity and development: reducing poverty, combating\ninternational terrorism, fighting transnational crime,\n16\n\npromoting human dignity and human rights, and\nupholding the human race as a whole.\nIn South-East Asia, the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) is to create its three-pillared\ncommunity \u2014 the ASEAN Economic Community, the\nASEAN Security Community and the ASEAN Socio-\nCultural Community \u2014 by the year 2020. The\nrealization of ASEAN communities, as in other\nregional or subregional communities, requires bridging\nthe development gap.\nIt was Thailand\u2019s initiative to take on the role of\nbuilding that bridge by introducing the Economic\nCooperation Strategy \u2014 known as ACMECS \u2014 and\nthereby laying a faster track towards sustainable\ndevelopment for its neighbours: Cambodia, Laos,\nMyanmar and Vietnam. Through the creation of more\njobs and the narrowing of the income gap, that strategy\nwill serve as a building block for ASEAN\u2019s three-\npillared community.\nFurther to the east, the ASEAN 10 are working\nwith its East Asian friends to create the East Asian\nCommunity, comprising the ASEAN 10, China, Japan\nand the Republic of Korea. To the west, Thailand sees\nthe need to connect south-east Asia\u2019s development with\nits friends in South Asia. The first summit of the\nBangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand\nEconomic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) \u2014 seven countries\nin South-East and South Asia around the Bay of\nBengal \u2014 took place in Thailand in July, agreeing on a\nfree trade area within the group which forms an\neconomic and development bridge between the two\nsubregions.\nThese building blocks and that partnership are\npart and parcel of the firm foundation for the Asia\nCooperation Dialogue (ACD), the first pan-Asian\ndevelopment forum. The ACD was initiated on the\nbasis of Thailand\u2019s conviction as to the virtue of\npartnership in drawing strength from diversity and in\ntransforming diversity from a phenomenon that tears us\napart to a force that unites us.\nWith 25 member countries \u2014 countries from\nevery part of Asia \u2014 and still growing, the two-and-a-\nhalf-year-old ACD will become an important building\nblock for multilateral cooperation and the United\nNations multilateral system. Through such building\nblocks, we can learn to live with one another\u2019s\ndifferences and to cultivate a culture of peace and\ntolerance in order to counteract the violence and terror\nin today\u2019s world.\nWe cherish multilateralism as the best means to\nsecure peace around the world. We cherish\nmultilateralism as the best means to develop prosperity\naround the world. But above all, we cherish\nmultilateralism as the best means to achieve both\nsecurity and development worldwide. By the same\ntoken, State security and human security, which foster\ndevelopment, must always be two sides of the same\ncoin.\nFrom Iraq to Saudi Arabia, from Indonesia to\nRussia, shocking acts of terror have been perpetrated,\nseemingly calculated to shake confidence and\nundermine hope. As civilized societies, we must come\ntogether to fight terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, wherever it may occur. Terrorism is a\ndirect threat to State security, but it also undermines\nhuman security.\nThat is why the development of human security\nand State security must proceed on parallel tracks. The\nworld cannot be a secure place if its population is still\nsuffering from poverty and deprivation. The world\ncannot really be peaceful if we cannot be successful in\nour efforts to make progress towards achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThat is why Thailand believes in the\nenhancement of human security as a means of making\nthe nation secure. Domestically, the Ministry of Social\nDevelopment and Human Security is in charge of our\npolicy and implementation. Internationally, we are\nactive in the Human Security Network and in other\ninternational arenas in which human security issues are\nparamount.\nThailand has long advocated balanced\ndevelopment, with freedom from fear and freedom\nfrom want as the two inseparable prongs of human\nsecurity. We intend to continue to do so even more\nintensively as Thailand prepares to assume the\nchairmanship of the Human Security Network in 2005-\n2006. We intend to further advocate such balanced\ndevelopment by embracing partnership between the\nGovernment and civil society.\nThe Human Security Network statement issued in\nThailand on the eve of the 15th International AIDS\nConference in Bangkok last July \u2014 which was\nattended by more than 25,000 people and recognized\n17\n\nHIV/AIDS as an issue of both development and human\nsecurity \u2014 clearly reflects development and security as\ninterconnected.\nWe view the issue of landmines in the same light.\nThey are as much a humanitarian issue as a\ndevelopment one. As President of the Fifth Meeting of\nthe States Parties to the Mine-Ban Convention, I have\nbeen working with the World Bank to reflect that\napproach in carrying out mine action. I am grateful for\nthe Bank\u2019s cooperation in realizing the development\ndimension of the landmine issue. I also appreciate the\nBank\u2019s readiness to mobilize resources for the training\nof deminers and capacity-building for survivors so that\nthey may function as productive members of society.\nWe are confident that the World Bank partnership will\nprovide States parties to the Convention with greater\nresources that will help to achieve the Convention\u2019s\ngoal.\nAs we try to secure peace for the world; as\nattempts are made to shatter our world\u2019s peace and\nsecurity with terror, fear, hatred and violence; as many\nstruggle against poverty; and as we pledge our\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals,\nthe multilateral system that we need to rely upon is\nfacing challenges and threats to its effectiveness of\nunprecedented a magnitude and proportion.\nHowever, amid those challenges, we are fortunate\nto see today nations building partnership with nations;\nnations learning to live with differences, and even\nturning differences and diversity into a common\nstrength; and nations learning to achieve a higher level\nof tolerance, working at the economical, cultural and\npolitical levels to nurture a culture of peace and a\nculture of tolerance.\nThrough building blocks like the ones Thailand\nhas been initiating in Asia, throughout Africa, Latin\nAmerica, Europe and elsewhere, and through South-\nSouth cooperation, a number of responsible nations are\nready to make contributions, in their own way, to turn\ndifferences into cooperation and partnerships. Those\npartnerships and building blocks deal with security and\ndevelopment, the two defining principles of the United\nNations.\nThose partnerships and building blocks can lay\nthe foundation for a more effective functioning of the\nUnited Nations multilateral system \u2014 a system that\nneeds redefining and redesigning to respond effectively\nto the new geosocial and political landscape of the\nworld.\nPresent-day realities \u2014 the emergence of\nbuilding blocks, the inextricable linkage between\ndevelopment and security, and the need to develop\nhuman and State security on parallel tracks \u2014 clearly\nreflect how much the world has changed since 1945.\nThat is why United Nations reform is not a\nquestion only of the effectiveness of any particular\norgan of the Organization. Nor is it merely a question\nof numbers or composition. It is fundamental,\ntherefore, to ask some pertinent questions.\nHow can the United Nations be made more\nresponsive to current needs and realities, so that it\ndevotes equal attention to the issues of security and\ndevelopment? What would be the best mechanism to\ndeal adequately with issues of development and long-\nterm global economic issues? What would be the best\nmechanism to deal adequately with post-conflict\nnation-building and reconstruction? What would be the\nbest mechanism to ensure a greater participation of\ncivil society, recognizing it as an important\nconstituency for development and conflict resolution?\nHow to ensure cooperation among the multilateral\nUnited Nations system and regional, subregional and\ninterregional organizations, recognizing them as\nimportant building blocks for a more effective\nmultilateralism?\nSecurity Council reform is needed. That much is\nnot in doubt. But if expansion is needed, what realistic\ncriteria are necessary for the expansion to reach greater\neffectiveness? Does it need to be more transparent?\nWhat are the roles and relationship among its\nmembers?\nConcerning the General Assembly, a body\nrepresented now by almost 200 Member States, more\nthan three times larger than at the time of the founding\nof the United Nations, is it too cumbersome and do we\nremain content with its work process? How can the\nAssembly be streamlined, energized, and become more\nfocused?\nThose are not all the questions asked, and\nThailand is not the only one asking. But all of us will\nhave to find the answers. While we are all entitled to\ndifferent views, opinions, and analyses, ultimately the\ndecision must be made by us, the Member States of the\nUnited Nations.\n18\n\nReform of such a venerable institution is never\neasy. We have to be realistic about that. But we have\nfaith in the far-sightedness and wisdom of United\nNations Members to take a holistic view and choose\nthe right path, even if it is the path less travelled.\nThailand pledges to apply all our experiences in\nforging partnerships in order to play a responsible and\nconstructive role in contributing to the United Nations\nreform process. We have supported the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change and will look\nforward to its report in December, as well as to the\nfruitful and constructive debate by all of us thereafter.\nWhether the United Nations recovers from its\nmid-life crisis or sinks into irrelevance is up to us, the\nMember States. For what it is and what it will become,\nthe United Nations is our own creation made of our\nown commitment and goodwill. It is up to us to rise to\nthe challenge. Only when nations are united, will we\nget the United Nations."

        "file_text": "This is my first address\nto this body in my capacity as the Prime Minister of\nCroatia. I feel privileged to be able to present the\nAssembly with the Croatian Government\u2019s strategic\npriorities in the domain of foreign policy.\nI would like at the outset to congratulate Minister\nJean Ping on his assumption of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success in\nperforming his highly important task. He can rely fully\non Croatia\u2019s support and cooperation.\nFor the first time, Croatia is addressing the\nGeneral Assembly as a candidate country for\nmembership in the European Union. Today, I would\nlike to share with you Croatia\u2019s position with respect to\nthe most important tasks facing the United Nations at\nthis time of great multilateral challenges.\nThe very fact that so many heads of State and\nGovernment leaders have gathered here in New York to\nmark the beginning of the fifty-ninth General\nAssembly session serves as a telling affirmation that\nmultilateralism is a driving force in global politics and\nconfirms that we live in no ordinary times.\nThe world at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury is profoundly different from the one in which\nthe Berlin wall started to crumble. Never before have\nwe faced so many opportunities stemming from new\ntechnologies and enhanced regional and global\ncooperation. And seldom have we encountered as many\nthreats and challenges as we do today.\nTragic events in recent years, from New York to\nMoscow, from the Middle East all the way to Southern\nAsia have confirmed that terrorism currently stands out\nas the most pressing threat to our world, taking, as it\nhas, thousands of innocent lives at random. Equally\ndangerous is the threat of weapons of mass destruction\n(WMDs). We must resort to all means necessary to\nprevent the proliferation of these vehicles of death. If\nthe two evils of terrorism and WMDs are synergized,\nthey could bring upon mankind an unforeseeable level\nof destruction.\nTherefore, we must not relax our efforts in the\nfight against global terrorism nor neglect the deadly\nimpact of WMDs. These issues must remain at the top\nof our priorities; any hesitation to address them in a\ntimely and appropriate manner could have unforgiving\nconsequences.\nThe United Nations should continue to play a\ndecisive role in our quest for a stable, secure and\nprosperous world. Croatia welcomes the reports of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the United Nations\n(A/59/1) and the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration (A/59/282). I would particularly like to\ncommend his reform efforts to date. He has identified\nmany challenges to the United Nations and we should\nnot hesitate to meet them. We particularly share his\nassessment that the United Nations requires adequate\nsecurity and institutional agility to adapt to changing\ncircumstances in the world. The Security Council has a\nparamount responsibility in that regard, but we must\nnot overlook the role of the General Assembly, whose\npotential is far from being explored to the fullest.\nRegarding Security Council reform, Croatia\nsupports the enlargement of the Council in all\ncategories of membership, based on appropriate\nregional representation.\nLet us make the United Nations even more\nrelevant, with a range of inventive and collaborative\napproaches that will increase the effectiveness of our\njoint efforts and result in the Organization\u2019s increased\ncapability to respond to the needs and realities of the\nnew century.\nThe credibility of the United Nations does not\ndepend solely on the political will of its Member States\nand its capacity to manage crises. It also depends on its\n39\n\ncapacity to respond to the expectations of those who\nare in dire need of assistance, who cannot protect\nthemselves from imbalances and injustice. We cannot\nshy away from seeking all available solutions to the\nfundamental global challenges we face today, including\nextreme poverty, drug smuggling, the spread of deadly\ndiseases and global climate change. Globalization\nneeds to be mastered; the opportunities it offers need to\nbe assessed and its excesses rectified.\nFinding appropriate answers to those fundamental\nquestions requires multilateral cooperation, with a\nviable and effective United Nations at its core. We all\nwish to see a strong and decisive United Nations that is\ncapable of effectively responding to current and future\nchallenges, but this cannot happen by default. It\ndepends solely on the contribution and dedication of\neach and every Member State.\nCroatia gained extensive experience in post-\nconflict management after the war that was imposed\nupon it in the 1990s, especially in the fields of refugee\nreturn, confidence building, prosecuting war crimes,\neconomic reconstruction and the reintegration of war-\ntorn areas with the rest of the country. We stand ready\nto contribute our knowledge and share it with those\nwho need it.\nIn confronting alarming challenges, such as\nsecurity, poverty, terrorism, pandemics and\nenvironmental issues, collective action is most likely to\nyield the best results, since not even the most powerful\namong us can bear the burden alone.\nAt this very moment, Croatian peacekeepers are\nparticipating in seven United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions. We are determined to further intensify our\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions\nwith respect to the composition and number of troops\ndeployed, as well as the theatres of operation.\nWe will continue to support the training of\npeacekeepers from newest troop-contributing\ncountries \u2014 whether provided directly or under the\nauspices of the United Nations \u2014 by receiving foreign\nofficers as attendees of the relevant training courses in\nthe Republic of Croatia, as well as by sending Croatian\ninstructors to organize and conduct courses in the\nnewest troop-contributing countries.\nCroatia has presented its candidacy for\nmembership in the Security Council for the 2008-2009\nterm. Our membership would not only represent a great\ntribute to my country, but also a recognition of all the\neffort that has been fruitfully invested in the peace and\nstability of South-East Europe.\nWe are proud of our achievements since\nbecoming a United Nations Member State in May\n1992. From being part of a European powder keg,\nCroatia grew into one of the key generators and\npromoters of stability in South-East Europe and\nbeyond. With a growing economy, a greatly expanded\nhighway network and a blossoming tourism industry,\nCroatia is firmly oriented towards the future. And I can\nstate with confidence that the best is yet to come.\nCroatia has successfully embarked upon the road\nof Euro-Atlantic integration, with a clear goal of\nEuropean Union and NATO membership. The bedrock\nof Croatia\u2019s foreign policy remains good bilateral\nrelations with all our neighbours and beyond, cross-\nborder and regional cooperation and constructive\nmultilateralism.\nMy country is speedily preparing for the opening\nof accession negotiations with the European Union in\nearly 2005. We are confident that Croatia will fully\nmeet all the criteria required in this demanding process\non time. We have already demonstrated our reform and\ndecision-making abilities through the fulfilment of the\nCopenhagen criteria required for European Union\ncandidate status. This has been far from easy, but in the\nend, Croatia\u2019s success demonstrates that hard work and\nreform-oriented policies are the best possible\ninvestment in a country\u2019s future.\nCroatia is ready to serve as a model country in\nSouth-East Europe, encouraging and assisting our\nneighbours to realize their Euro-Atlantic ambitions.\nThe prospect of EU membership has proved to be the\nbest incentive for the countries of Central and south-\neast Europe to implement comprehensive political,\neconomic, institutional and democratic reforms.\nA unified Europe is no longer a dream; it is a\nreality upon which the prosperity and security of the\nentire continent is based. The European Union is\neconomic prosperity and cooperation; it is stability and\nsecurity; but, above all, it is its values that stand out so\nstrongly. We all share the same values, the same\nprinciples and the same dedication.\nA famous Croatian poet, Dobrisa Cesaric, wrote a\npoem about a waterfall whose beauty and might are\n40\n\ncreated by thousands of small drops of water. Croatia\u2019s\ndrop is a part of this wonder, called \u201cone Europe\u201d.\nCroatia is determined to contribute to the best of\nits ability to the success of this Organization and to the\nprinciples on which it is based. Too often we fail to\nfathom the true meaning of a phrase that is much more\nthan the mere name of our Organization: the United\nNations.\nThe United Nations \u2014 there can be no better\nglobal formula in the face of the mounting challenges\nand the potential, burdens, hopes and expectations of\nthe new century."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election to\npreside over the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. I assure you of my delegation\u2019s full\ncooperation in the discharge of your important duties.\nAllow me to also pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian R. Hunte, Minister for External Affairs of\nSaint Lucia, for his outstanding leadership in the\nAssembly\u2019s last session. Our full appreciation goes to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ninvaluable and wise stewardship of the United Nations.\nI also wish to express, on behalf of His Majesty\u2019s\nGovernment and the people of Nepal, our sincere\ncondolences to the Governments, countries and peoples\nthat have suffered the consequences of hurricanes and\nterrorist attacks in recent weeks and months.\nWe live in one of the most turbulent periods since\nthe Second World War. The end of the cold war\nunleashed forces of democracy and economic\nopenness, and the revolution in science, and\ntechnology has converted the world into a global\nvillage by shrinking distances and increasing\nconnectivity. In tandem with this came many negative\nconsequences. Internal conflicts have proliferated and\npopulations have been displaced. International\nterrorism has increased. Globalization has widened the\ngap between the rich and the poor. Poverty, ignorance,\ndisease and injustice have persisted and even worsened\nfor the majority of humanity. Transnational crimes\nhave spread their wings. No country is immune from\nthe impact of these huge problems facing humanity\ntoday. Addressing these problems is a challenge that\nrequires collective action by the international\ncommunity in a spirit of multilateralism. The United\nNations has the legitimacy and mandate to promote\nmultilateral solutions to the shared problems of our\ntime.\nIndeed, the United Nations embodies all of\nhumanity\u2019s shared dreams and its hopes for peace,\nsecurity and development. Nepal has abiding faith in\nthe principles and objectives enshrined in the United\nNations Charter, and we recognize the central role of\nthe United Nations in the pursuit of those shared\ndreams.\nThe emerging international situation is fraught\nwith a multitude of challenges. Internal conflicts have\nafflicted countries from Iraq to Burundi and from Haiti\nto the Sudan. Terrorism has become a global menace,\ncasting a dark shadow over the lives of millions of\npeople around the globe. Deadly weapons pose a\nconstant threat to the safety of human beings and the\nvery existence of human civilization.\nBy all accounts, the situation in Iraq is highly\nvolatile and extremely dangerous. The Nepalese people\nhave yet to overcome their revulsion over the brutal\nkilling of 12 innocent Nepalese hostages on 31 August\nin that country. We strongly condemn this dastardly\ncrime committed by the terrorists. It is our fervent hope\nthat the Iraqi people will be able to improve their\nsecurity environment, hold the scheduled elections on\n9\n\ntime and live in a free, secure, democratic and\nprosperous Iraq.\nThe Middle East is caught in a cycle of violence.\nTo break this cycle, both Israel and Palestine will have\nto exercise maximum restraint and engage in fruitful\ndialogue to build the mutual confidence critical for\nimplementing the Quartet-endorsed road map, which\noffers a viable and durable two-State solution. Nepal\nsupports the road map and views the Israeli plan to pull\nout of Gaza as a positive step.\nThough the security situation has improved over\ntime, Afghanistan is far from secure, and its\nreconstruction is far from satisfactory. The world\ncommunity must do more to provide security to the\nentire country, hold free and fair elections and\naccelerate the speed of its reconstruction and\ndevelopment.\nNepal supports United Nations efforts to bring\npeace and normalcy to Haiti, Burundi, Liberia, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nthe Sudan. We are proud to be part of United Nations\nefforts in our own humble way in those countries by\ndeploying our troops. The world community ought to\nsustain those efforts and help those countries in their\nrebuilding and reconstruction endeavours.\nNepal\u2019s track record is a testimony to its\nunflinching commitment to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. So far, over 45,000 Nepalese\npeacekeepers have served in various missions in an\noutstanding manner, and 47 of them have sacrificed\ntheir precious lives in the service of peace and\nhumanity. At the moment, nearly 2,500 Nepalese blue\nhelmets are deployed in 12 peacekeeping missions\naround the world.\nNepal appreciates the United Nations help in\nbridging the equipment gaps for our deployment. We\nurge the United Nations to enrich and widen the scope\nof consultations with troop-contributing countries,\nincluding in the areas of mission planning and pre-\ndeployment preparations. We urge the United Nations\nto give greater opportunities to Nepalese nationals in\nmanagement positions in the Secretariat and in field\nmissions.\nAs we remain committed to peacekeeping and\nwilling to bring our experience to the table, Nepal has\nsought a non-permanent seat on the Security Council\nfor the period 2007-2008, after a gap of 19 years. I take\nthis opportunity to appeal to Member States to give us\nthe privilege of their support in the election to be held\nin 2006.\nIt is our firm belief that the international\ncommunity must look beyond the immediate conflicts\nand seek to build a strong foundation for durable peace\nby pursuing disarmament, development and the rule of\nlaw.\nNepal is deeply concerned by the setback in the\ndisarmament realm. Of course, the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction is very important to\nkeeping such weapons from rogue elements. No\ndurable peace will be possible without concerted\nefforts for disarmament, particularly of nuclear\nweapons, as they are the greatest threat to human\ncivilization. It is regrettable that the Conference on\nDisarmament has had no programme of work for the\nlast several years. That body must be allowed to work\non a coherent strategy leading to the complete\nelimination of nuclear weapons in a time-bound\nmanner.\nWe reiterate our support to nuclear-weapon-free\nzones and to keeping outer space free of such weapons.\nThe international community should also work together\nto strengthen controls over small arms and light\nweapons in order to prevent their abuse by non-State\nactors.\nRegional centres for peace and disarmament are\ninstrumental in building confidence among nations.\nNepal is eager to relocate to Kathmandu the Regional\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the\nPacific at the earliest possible time. We are prepared to\nsign the necessary agreements, consistent with the\nprevailing diplomatic practices and provisions of the\nother two regional centres. We also want the\nKathmandu process revived without delay.\nInternational peace and security will continue to\nelude us until we address the root causes of conflicts:\nnamely, poverty, ignorance, disease, exclusion and\ninjustice. Most of the conflicts around the world today,\nwhich have regional and global consequences, are\nrooted in those sad human conditions. It is imperative\nthat we address those conditions collectively for the\nshared benefit of humankind as a whole.\nToday, more than a billion people live in absolute\npoverty. Millions of people remain illiterate.\nPreventable diseases are taking a huge toll on children,\nand HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are\ndecimating entire societies, particularly in Africa.\nGrowing populations have caused environmental\n10\n\ndegradation. Racial, cultural and wealth-related\ndivisions have often been sources of exclusion,\nintolerance and injustice. Poverty has forced many to\nmigrate, and crimes have flourished in those sad\nconditions.\nThere is no doubt that the developing countries\nhave the primary responsibility for their own economic\ndevelopment and social progress. They need to take\nmeasures to reform their policies and institutions and\ncreate a climate in which enterprise, innovation and\ndevelopment can flourish. Most of those countries have\nbeen trying to do that on their own initiative and to live\nup to their side of the pledges undertaken in various\nglobal compacts.\nBut their development partners also have their\nobligations to meet under various global compacts,\nbecause developing countries, given the mammoth\nchallenges they face, cannot grapple with them and\nmeet the Millennium Development Goals without\nenhanced assistance from their development partners.\nThe development partners should meet the agreed\nofficial development assistance targets and provide\ngreater debt relief to indebted countries. Indeed,\nalthough official development assistance flows have\nincreased since 2002, they remain way below the\nadditional $50 billion per year that is required to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Debt\nrepayment is eating up a large chunk of the resources\nof developing countries, and the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative has yet to cover all\nleast developed countries.\nIn the long run, fair globalization on a level\nplaying field and open markets will help reduce\npoverty, increase employment and lift the standard of\nliving in developing nations. The development\npartners, therefore, should dismantle their agricultural\nsubsidies and open their markets to goods and labour\nfrom the South. They should also offer assistance to\nbuild capacities to attract and absorb foreign direct\ninvestment and to remove supply-side constraints,\nespecially in least developed nations. The least\ndeveloped countries \u2014 the most marginalized \u2014 need\nmore generous assistance and market access, as agreed\nto in the Brussels Programme of Action, to break the\nvicious circle of poverty and join the global economy.\nOur studies have shown that Nepal will not be able to\nmeet most Millennium Development Goals without\nsuch targeted measures from its development partners.\nTheir geographical bottleneck and distance from\nthe main corridors of commerce handicap landlocked\ndeveloping countries. We urge the transit and\ndevelopment partners to implement the Almaty\nProgramme of Action and to overcome their\ndifficulties.\nThough Nepal joined the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) last year, most least developed\ncountries remain outside the multilateral trade\nframework. We call on the members of the WTO to\nfacilitate quick and concessionary memberships for\nthose countries. Nepal also urges the international\ncommunity to change the international financial\narchitecture so as to give a voice to the small and\nweak.\nNepal believes that democracy, human rights and\nthe rule of law will have to go hand in hand with peace\nand development to achieve overall progress in a\ncountry. It is heartening that more people in the world\nenjoy democracy and freedom today than ever before.\nSadly, however, conflicts and poverty have driven\nmillions of people from their homes and countries.\nConflicts, together with criminal gangs, have also\nviolated the rule of law and peoples\u2019 human rights.\nNew democracies should learn from each other\u2019s\nexperiences in consolidating democratic institutions\nand values, and the world community should join\nhands to fight transnational crime. The rule of law\nshould apply not only in domestic situations but also\nthroughout the international community.\nThere are 17 million refugees around the\nworld \u2014 a staggering number. Many more millions of\npersons are internally displaced. In many areas, those\npeople live in fear and under appalling conditions.\nChildren are deprived of a decent education, and adults\nlack jobs and economic opportunities. In some cases,\nwhole generations have grown up in refugee camps,\nstruggling to find their identity.\nThe world community has an obligation to\nprovide humanitarian assistance to such needy people\nand to help them resettle once they have returned\nhome.\nNearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been\nliving in camps in eastern Nepal for over a decade. Our\nbilateral efforts to find a negotiated settlement with\nBhutan have been slow and halting. Even the refugees\nwho have been verified by a joint team have yet to go\nback home. Other refugees are waiting for joint\nverification.\n11\n\nFor generations, Nepal and Bhutan have remained\nclose friends and have respected each other. The\npresence of Bhutanese refugees on our soil is an\navoidable irritant. Therefore, we earnestly hope that\nthe process of verification can be expedited, that\nverified refugees can be repatriated in a time-bound\nmanner, and that returnees will be able to enjoy their\nhuman rights and to live in safety, dignity and honour\nin their own country.\nObviously, Nepal does not have the capacity to\ntake care of those refugees, though we have let them\nstay on humanitarian grounds. Hence, we call on the\ninternational community, including the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), to continue its support until the refugees are\nable to go back home and fully resettle there.\nOur situation has become even more difficult due\nto the armed violence launched in 1996 by the so-\ncalled Maoists. That violent movement began just\nwhen democracy was taking root and economic growth\nwas accelerating owing to policy reforms. The Maoists\nhave brutalized people and destroyed private homes\nand public infrastructure worth billions of rupees. They\nhave been abducting children and recruiting them as\nchild soldiers. They have continued to defy our call to\nrespects schools as zones of peace. They are engaged\nin extortion and in the intimidation and killing of\ninnocent civilians.\nThis notwithstanding, His Majesty\u2019s Government\nhas been sincerely seeking a results-oriented dialogue\nto find a political settlement. At the same time, the\nGovernment has an obligation to protect the lives of\npeople and to safeguard private property and public\ninfrastructure by strengthening security. The\nGovernment deeply appreciates the moral and material\nsupport our friends have been providing us in the fight\nagainst the violence.\nIn that context, we sincerely appreciate the\ninterest expressed by the Secretary-General in the\nsituation in Nepal, and his readiness to help the\nGovernment\u2019s efforts towards peace. The four-party\ncoalition Government, with its broad mandate, is\nworking seriously to initiate the peace process in\nNepal. We are confident that we will be able to resolve\nthe problem by ourselves.\nEven in the midst of this difficulty, His Majesty\u2019s\nGovernment is committed to protecting the freedoms\nand human rights of citizens. The National Human\nRights Commission monitors the human rights\nsituation in the country, and a three-year National\nHuman Rights Action Plan has been launched to\nimplement our human rights commitments.\nWe have been seeking technical assistance from\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights as concerns the capacity-building of\nthe National Human Rights Commission. The Human\nRights Promotion Centre has been established to\nensure inter-departmental coordination and the\nsupervision of human rights issues.\nThe United Nations is the pivot of multilateralism\nthat is imperative to address the complex challenges of\nour time. Nepal supports the ongoing efforts for United\nNations reform, including those aimed at revitalizing\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil. Priority should be accorded to enhancing the\nrole of the United Nations in the area of economic and\nsocial development. Security Council reform has\nbecome an important issue for the international\ncommunity. Nepal has consistently supported the\nexpansion of the Council and reform of its methods of\nwork, so as to make it more representative, transparent\nand democratic.\nIn that context, the aspirations of some Member\nStates \u2014 mainly India, Japan, Germany and Brazil \u2014\nmerit serious consideration for permanent membership\nin the Security Council. At the same time, there is\nurgent need to expand the Council\u2019s non-permanent\nmembership to ensure greater participation of small\nMember States.\nNepal hopes the High-level Panel on Threats,\nChallenges and Change appointed by the Secretary-\nGeneral will come up with recommendations that could\nculminate in tangible reforms consistent with the\npresent realities of the world. The high-level plenary\nmeeting of the General Assembly at the sixtieth\nanniversary of the United Nations will be a landmark\nevent that should make a great leap forward on a\nnumber of outstanding issues and expedite\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\nThis fall, Nepal is organizing the Second World\nBuddhist Summit in Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord\nBuddha and a world heritage site in Nepal. We need\nsupport and participation from our friends the Member\nStates to make the conference a success and to revive\nin New York the international committee for the\ndevelopment of Lumbini, which we are planning to do\nsoon.\nTo conclude, the dawn of the new millennium\noffers us both opportunities for and challenges to\n12\n\nrevitalizing the United Nations and strengthening\nmultilateralism. As an active Member State, Nepal will\ndo its best to contribute to the efforts of the United\nNations in order to attain the shared goals of peace and\nprosperity for all."

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to\nstand here today to address the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session.\nWhen, in 1945, Liberia joined the efforts to\nestablish this Organization in order to bring an end to a\nglobal war and to pursue justice and maintain world\npeace, little did we know that we had subscribed to an\ninsurance policy that, 59 years later, would provide\ncoverage for Liberia and redeem its people and its\nsovereignty.\nAs members know, Liberia is a country in\ntransition from continued crisis to sustainable peace.\nThe United Nations, the United States and the\nEuropean Union have all worked with the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\nstabilize the situation, attending to the humanitarian\ncrisis and navigating the difficult road to peace. We\nremain immensely grateful for the role of South Africa\nand ECOWAS for providing regional leadership in the\nsearch for peace in Liberia. The pivotal roles played by\nboth the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Republic\nof Ghana deserve special commendation. We are\nparticularly grateful to Secretary-General Annan and\nthe United Nations, the United States and the European\nUnion for partnering with ECOWAS in these\nendeavours.\nI am pleased to inform this Assembly that the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement singed in Ghana in\nAugust 2003 continues to guide the Liberian peace\nprocess. A power-sharing National Transitional\nGovernment comprising all warring factions, political\nparties, and civil society is working. The ceasefire\nagreement signed on June 17, 2003, continues to be\ninsured by the 15,000-strong United Nations Mission\nin Liberia (UNMIL), operating with a Chapter VII\nmandate. The force is now disarming and demobilizing\nall armed groups.\nAt the beginning of the United Nations Mission\nin October 2003, we estimated that some 38,000\ncombatants would have submitted themselves to the\ndisarmament and demobilization program. Today,\n73,600 fighters have been disarmed. Over 22,000\npieces of serviceable weapons of all kinds have been\nsurrendered and decommissioned, and more than\n17\n\n5 million rounds of ammunition collected and\ndestroyed by UNMIL.\nMeanwhile, the high number of combatants\ndisarmed and demobilized has overwhelmed our\ncapacity to rehabilitate and reintegrate them. The\nabsence of social infrastructures exacerbates the\nsituation. War-related damage to the national\ninfrastructures and community facilities is extensive.\nWithout exception, all communities have lost their\ncapacity to accommodate and support even the\nslightest caseload of returnees.\nSome of the ex-combatants have enrolled in civil\nworks programmes sponsored by UNMIL, the\nEuropean Commission, the United States Agency for\nInternational Development and the People\u2019s Republic\nof China. A significant number are seeking readmission\ninto regular academic programmes. Others are\nenrolling in vocational training institutions to acquire\nlife skills.\nThere are special efforts being made for children\nand female former fighters to receive specialized care\nand training through programmes sponsored by United\nNations agencies and other international and local non-\ngovernmental organizations.\nAs a direct result of the civil conflict, a sizeable\nnumber of Liberians are currently residing outside of\nthe country, mostly as refugees. As disarmament nears\ncompletion and as our Government extends its\nauthority, the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees is preparing for organized repatriation of\nLiberians. In addition, some 500,000 internally\ndisplaced persons are expected to commence leaving\ntheir camps and returning to their local communities\ntowards the end of October this year.\nThe role the United Nations is playing to bring\nsustainable peace and human dignity to our country\nand people is phenomenal and indicative of the new\nchallenges which the United Nations and the\ninternational community must face and meet head on if\nwe, the people of the United Nations, are to live in\npeace and enjoy our inalienable rights. Peace and the\nfreedom to enjoy those rights under the rule of law\nrequire not just curative measures, but preventive\nactions to address the problems of poverty, ignorance\nand disease of the world\u2019s poorer peoples and\ncountries.\nThe National Transitional Government\u2019s recovery\nagenda has as its focus the improvement of the well-\nbeing of our people by the creation of employment\nopportunities to put returnees and ex-combatants to\nwork. Our recent history teaches us that when ex-\ncombatants are not meaningfully rehabilitated and\nreintegrated and that when many in our society are not\nstakeholders and are excluded, we run the risk that they\nwill return to violent crime and conflict. We are\nextremely worried about that prospect.\nAgainst that background, there is now real\nurgency to revive our economy and create jobs. That is\nwhy, in June of this year, I pleaded with the Security\nCouncil to lift the sanctions imposed on diamonds and\ntimber \u2014 two sectors that hold great potential for job\ncreation and economic recovery. Sanctions continue to\nhurt Liberia. It must not be forgotten that the sanctions\nwere imposed primarily because Liberia was exporting\nconflict by trafficking in arms for diamonds. A related\nreason was the lack of transparency and accountability\nin the management of State resources, especially from\nthe forestry sector and the maritime programme. That\nsituation no longer obtains.\nOur Government is not buying arms. To the\ncontrary, we are disarming tens of thousands of\ncombatants. We are also cooperating with the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank,\nthe African Development Bank, the European\nCommission and the United States Treasury and State\nDepartments in putting into place proper mechanisms\nfor transparency and accountability in the use of State\nresources.\nIn that regard, the European Commission is\nfunding the systems audit of five revenue-generating\nagencies and the Central Bank of Liberia. The World\nBank is working with the Government to reform the\npublic procurement system and is assisting the Liberia\nPetroleum Refinery Corporation to put into place a\nsystem of international competitive bidding of\npetroleum products. The IMF is assisting the Central\nBank to introduce transparency in the management of\nthe foreign exchange regime. The United States\nTreasury Department is engaged with us in financial\nsector reforms, particularly in the areas of monetary\npolicy, revenue enhancement, budgeting and\nexpenditure controls. Also, the United States State\nDepartment is working with the Forestry Development\nAuthority in implementing an environment-friendly\nforestry reform programme.\n18\n\nGiven all these efforts, we once again appeal to\nthe Security Council to lift the sanctions to enable us to\ncreate jobs and to attend to the enormous social needs\nof our people.\nIn early February, the United Nations, in\ncollaboration with the World Bank and the United\nStates Government, co-hosted a donors conference for\nLiberia. The aim of the conference was to seek support\nfor our two-year reconstruction plan. The international\ncommunity responded generously with pledges of $520\nmillion. I am happy to report that, to date, $455 million\nof those pledges have been classified as firm\ncommitments. Projects are under way to spend those\nfunds and to bring much needed relief to our people.\nElections in Liberia are not new, but most have\nbeen characterized by widespread rigging. Thus, unfair\nelections in themselves have been a major source of\nconflict in Liberia. This time around, Liberians are\ndetermined to undertake free and fair elections as an\nequity participation in the investment of sustainable\npeace and national renewal. The Transitional\nGovernment remains committed to the holding of\nelections in October 2005 and to the smooth transfer of\npower to a democratically elected Government in\nJanuary 2006.\nLiberia has developed strong collaborative efforts\nwith our neighbours in the Mano River Union to end\nthe activities of armed non-State actors. The Mano\nRiver Union countries have committed themselves to\nstrictly adhering to the Non-Aggression and Security\nCooperation Treaty of the Union and the meticulous\nimplementation of the fifteenth protocol. Liberia\nreiterates its commitment to cooperating with all\nprovisions on security and peace as enshrined in the\ncharters of the United Nations, the African Union, the\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\nMano River Union.\nWe call on the United Nations to urgently engage\nin crisis prevention and in strengthening the peace in\nour region. In that regard, we urge this body to work\nwith regional and subregional organizations, such as\nthe African Union and ECOWAS.\nToday more than ever before, the utility of the\nUnited Nations is being tested. Never before has the\nworld faced so many different types of conflicts in so\nmany different places at the same time. However, we\nare encouraged by the fact that the high number and\ncomplexity of those problems have not lessened the\ndetermination of Member States to stay the course of\nfostering international peace and stability.\nThe threat posed by global terrorism, combined\nwith widespread poverty, especially in developing\ncountries, constitutes a real barrier to the attainment of\nthe Millennium Goals.\nThe continued existence of conflicts in the\nMiddle East provides a source of worry. After decades,\nit is time that a workable solution be found to the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue.\nThe current Iraqi crisis is also troubling to a\nworld body searching for solutions to world conflicts.\nLiberia calls for a unified global approach to the Iraqi\nquestion and urges the United Nations to play an active\nrole in the resolution of that crisis.\nIn Africa, news from the Darfur region in Sudan\nis frightening. We support the position of the African\nUnion on the Darfur problem and ask for a speedy\nresolution of the crisis so as to bring relief to the\nregion.\nThe recent massacre of nearly 200 Tutsi in\nBurundi sends a grim reminder of the 1994 genocide in\nRwanda. Urgent action should be taken to contain the\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nMaking peace is difficult because the resolution\nof conflicts sometimes engenders new contradictions\nthat must be addressed. In post-conflict situations like\nours, where national capacities have been decimated,\nthe continued goodwill of the international community\nto assist in reconstruction is paramount. We thus pray\nfor the continued engagement of the United Nations in\nglobal crises.\nLiberia has gone through 15 years of violent\nconflicts. In Accra, Ghana, in 2003, Liberians reasoned\ntogether to reject war and build a better society. Liberia\nis now breaking through from being a failed State to\nbeing a democratic and vibrant society. There is now a\ngrowing sense of hope and optimism among our\npeople. We cannot fail now, for we have seen the cost\nof war as compared to the price of peace. Liberians\nhave finally resolved to choose the path of peace and\nstay on it."

In addition, I would like to\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Julian Hunte, for the important work he\naccomplished with the tireless support of the Bureau,\nincluding in particular with regard to our common\nendeavour to reform the Organization and enhance its\neffectiveness by, among other things, reviewing the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s methods of work.\nThe waning year has strengthened our common\nresolve to strengthen multilateralism and to give it\nprominence in the management of international affairs\nin the new international order, with the United Nations\nas the foundation and framework of that order. Despite\nthe ups and downs that the United Nations has\nexperienced, in particular in the Security Council, it is\ntime for there to be an active dialogue among the\nworld\u2019s nations, all of which adhere to the universality\nof the Organization and its unique and irreplaceable\nrole in promoting economic and social development\nand international peace and security. The world of\ncourse faces numerous challenges, some of which are\nnew in nature. Others, however, although older and\nbetter known, remain without real solutions \u2014 either\ndue to their complexity or because of a lack of\ndetermination on the part of the international\ncommunity to mobilize ways and means commensurate\nwith the stakes.\nIn January 2005, the General Assembly will\nreceive a report from the Panel of eminent persons\nappointed by the Secretary-General to reflect on\nreforms that could make the Organization more\neffective, transparent and democratic, as well as better\nable to carry out its mission and tackle the new\nchallenges requiring our attention. I trust that the Panel\nwill not fail to rely upon previous relevant proposals\nwhen framing its recommendations, in particular those\nmade at the Millennium Summit. As far as Cameroon\nis concerned, mankind must be at the heart of any\nsubstantive reform of the United Nations.\nMy country continues to promote the proposal\nput forth here in New York during the Millennium\nSummit by President Paul Biya. That proposal called\nfor the creation within the Secretariat of an\n28\n\ninternational ethics-monitoring centre entrusted with\nthe task of \u201cpromoting fundamental and universal\nhuman values between and within nations\u201d. (A/55/PV.5,\np. 27)\nIn addition, it also seems that the time has come\nfor the General Assembly to express its views on the\nissue of Security Council reform, and in particular with\nregard to expanding its membership. The proposals that\nhave been introduced in the General Assembly are\nundoubtedly a very good basis for discussion. The\nAssembly will recall that the Organization of African\nUnity called for a reconstituted Security Council that\nincluded seven seats for Africa, including 2 permanent\nseats. That proposal, which Cameroon fully endorses,\nstill stands. Nevertheless, we must forge concrete\nconsensus without delay, as an indicator of greater\ntransparency and renewed legitimacy of a Security\nCouncil that is more effective and credible.\nStanding side-by-side with other nations,\nCameroon is resolutely committed to eradicating new\nthreats that seriously imperil international peace and\nsecurity. We unreservedly condemn international\nterrorism and all forms of fundamentalism and\nextremism, which provide it with both a breeding\nground and a vehicle. It is for that reason that we\nreiterate our solidarity with all those who have fallen\nvictim to terrorism, most recently in Russia and the\nMiddle East.\nThe efforts undertaken by the Security Council in\nthat regard are encouraging. However, we believe that\nthe time has come for worldwide globalization and the\nsummit level. It is time to act together against the\nterrorist hydra. Cameroon once again suggests that a\nhigh-level conference be urgently convened to define\ncollectively more effective strategies to combat\nterrorism.\nThe new threats confronting the world are real\nchallenges, and it is only right that they be given\ncertain priority. That approach will be quite appropriate\nas the Organization\u2019s other traditional concerns\ncontinue to enjoy our full attention. Cameroon believes\nthat nothing can justify terrorism. Nevertheless, the\nresponse to terrorism and to other new threats cannot\nbe solely a military response.\nThe modern world must focus on the causes of\nviolence and on the injustices that undermine\ninternational peace. Resolving regional conflicts in\nAfrica, the Middle East and elsewhere; combating\npoverty and mobilizing against great epidemics, and\nagainst HIV/AIDS in particular; redressing the\nimbalance in world trade in goods and services; and\naddressing the foreign debt of poor countries \u2014 like\nthe new threats, all these challenges require the\nOrganization\u2019s attention.\nI mention this parallel because we run a real risk,\ntoday, of getting used to the endemic poverty that kills\nthousands every day, particularly in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. Solidarity with the poor must become a very\nconcrete reality rather than mere lip service. In order to\ncombat hunger and poverty, we need massive private\nand public financing. We need relief from the burden\nof debt.\nThe world today is faced with a paradox. The\npoorest countries are the ones that have the most open\nand liberal economies. Even their non-commercial\nsector has been privatized, causing unemployment for\nmillions of citizens and the destabilization of basic\nsocial sectors, such as water and electricity, for many\nyears, with harmful consequences for all economic\nactivity. The current economic order, if we are not\ncareful, could consolidate \u2014 and indeed make\npermanent \u2014 current relations based on force, to the\nbenefit of rich countries and to the detriment of poor\ncountries. The rich can easily subsidize their\nagriculture, their industry and their airlines, among\nother sectors. The poor countries, however, under the\nwatchful eyes of financial institutions in which their\nvoices go unheard, must submit themselves to the law\nof the market. Cotton from West and Central Africa is\na perfect example of unbalanced and unfair\nglobalization. We should not become discouraged,\nhowever, and Cameroon is convinced that under your\npresidency, Sir, the fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly will adopt strong initiatives to help poor\ncountries and to ensure a readjustment of globalization,\nmaking it more equitable and beneficial to all.\nInternational economic relations must be profoundly\nreformed with a view to ensuring greater United\nNations involvement.\nThe same issues that apply to the economy also\napply to the subject of health. The world, viewed in its\nentirety, is rich. It has the means of providing adequate\nhealth for all. Medicines exist that should make it\npossible to contain the major pandemics. Research\nscientists and the pharmaceutical industry are making\ngreat strides on a daily basis in combating malaria,\ntuberculosis, meningitis and cholera, among other\ndiseases. Those scourges, however, kill millions of\nAfricans every year. The reason for this is poverty and\ninsufficient means to obtain care and medicines.\n29\n\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS, which is far more\nterrible since it is thus far incurable, we welcome the\nfact that scientific research today is making it possible\nto drastically diminish its devastating scope. The\nBangkok International AIDS Conference has certainly\ngiven reason for hope. Significant pledges to help\neradicate this scourge are announced on a daily basis.\nUnfortunately, most of the persons infected by the HIV\nvirus are unable to obtain anti-retroviral medications\nsince they lack the necessary financial means.\nCombating AIDS is a worldwide cause, rallying us all.\nI have touched upon regional conflicts. Their\nnegative impact on the international environment,\nwhether politically, economically or in humanitarian\nand security terms, requires no further demonstration.\nAfrica, as if not already handicapped enough, is the\ncontinent most plagued by conflict, as evidenced by the\nSecurity Council agenda.\nThe situation in some countries gives rise to\nrelative optimism. Developments in Liberia, Sierra\nLeone, Guinea-Bissau and the Comoros give us reasons\nfor hope. Recent firm commitments by political actors\nin the crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire doubtless give rise to\nbetter prospects for that fraternal, friendly country.\nIn Central Africa, despite some improvement, the\nsituation remains worrisome. It calls for constant\nvigilance and increased involvement on all levels by\nthe international community. In this respect, the\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region,\nwhich has been announced several times but has\nalways been deferred, must finally be held as\nscheduled in November 2004. That will make it\npossible to lay a fresh foundation for constructive\ncooperation among the countries of the region,\nconsistent with the interests of their respective peoples.\nStill with regard to Central Africa, it is our hope\nthat, at this session, the debate on cooperation between\nthe United Nations and the Economic Community of\nCentral African States (ECCAS) will address the\nconcerns expressed by our subregion\u2019s heads of State\nto the Secretary-General\u2019s multidisciplinary assessment\nmission to Central Africa. I recall here that the heads\nof State had unanimously and firmly expressed a desire\nfor a political presence by the Secretary-General in\nCentral Africa through a permanent subregional\nstructure. We take note of the statement made here in\nthis connection by the delegation of the Republic of the\nCongo, as Chairman of ECCAS.\nThe crisis in Darfur is currently a matter of grave\nconcern on our continent. Wishing to prevent a\ncatastrophe such as has occurred in the past, the\nAfrican Union has squarely embraced this question\nwith the decisive support of the Security Council and\nother international partners. We all hope a positive\nsolution will be reached quickly. In order to do this,\ndialogue must be ongoing, forward-looking and\nvoluntary on the part of all protagonists in the crisis.\nTo be sure, the political will and determination of the\nSudanese authorities are key; they must continue to\ndisplay these qualities. That is the only way that an\nunprecedented humanitarian catastrophe will be\navoided. In any case, the international community must\nbe further mobilized behind the African Union in order\nto ward off this curse and avert this major crisis\nwithout delay.\nMy country is profoundly devoted to peace. It\nwill spare no effort to promote the peaceful settlement\nof disputes. In that connection, it will continue to\npromote peace throughout the world, and specifically\nin Africa, in Central Africa and in the Gulf of Guinea.\nAs members know, the International Court of\nJustice in The Hague, after lengthy deliberations\nlasting almost 10 years, handed down its judgment, on\n10 October 2002, relating to the boundary dispute\nbetween Cameroon and Nigeria. Both countries, within\nthe context of the Joint Commission established by the\nSecretary-General and chaired by his Special\nRepresentative, have agreed to define the ways and\nmeans of implementing that judgment and have\nadopted a programme of work with a specific\ntimetable, approved on 31 January 2004 by their heads\nof State and the Secretary-General. The Secretary-\nGeneral has eloquently reported on the progress that\nhas been made in this connection. We call upon the\nUnited Nations family to give its full support to the\nSecretary-General and to use its influence to help\nNigeria and Cameroon in implementing the judgment\nof the International Court of Justice.\nWhether it be the reform of our Organization to\nmake it more efficient, democratic and legitimate; or\nthe Middle East peace process to re-launch the road\nmap; or pacification, reconstruction, enhanced security\nand institution-building in Iraq and Afghanistan; or the\nsettlement of African disputes and the post-conflict\nreconstruction of such countries; or combating AIDS\nand other pandemics; or adjusting financial and trade\nmechanisms to help the weakest and most exposed\ncountries; or, finally, eliminating poverty:\nMr. President, our dear brother, we think that you have\na full plate. Quite fortunately, your great qualities will\n30\n\nallow you to involve the international community in\nworking on these problems.\nMoreover, you have at your side the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, Nobel\nPeace Prize laureate, whose actions and commitments\nto promote peace, security and development today\nserve as both a lever and an engine for the activities\nundertaken by the international community as a whole.\nYou also have at your side, I am sure, the entirety of\nthe United Nations membership. Cameroon, for its\npart, will spare no effort to support you in your lofty\nmission."

        "file_text": "The Holy See is\nhonoured to take part in the general debate of the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations for the first\ntime since the Assembly adopted resolution 58/314 on\n1 July 2004, which formalized and specified the rights\nand prerogatives of its status as a Permanent Observer,\na status which the Holy See has enjoyed since 1964.\nIt is therefore my pleasant duty to express sincere\ngratitude to all the Member States. In approving the\naforesaid resolution, they signalled once again the\nparticular bond of cooperation between the Apostolic\nSee and the United Nations, already underlined by\nPope John Paul II on his first visit to this Assembly\nexactly 25 years ago. In this significant circumstance, I\nam honoured to convey to you, Sir, and to all of you\ngathered here to represent your noble countries, the\nrespectful and cordial greetings of Pope John Paul II. I\nbring a special greeting to the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and also to his\nworthy assistants. Their work, as recorded in the\nannual report of the Secretary General (A/59/1) with\nreference, above all, to conflict prevention and\npeacekeeping in the world, deserves the appreciation\nand gratitude of us all.\nSeveral of the themes included in the agenda of\nthe General Assembly may be considered essential for\nattaining the supreme objective of peace and for the\nfuture of humanity. To quote only a few: the United\nNations and a new global human order; pursuit of the\nMillennium Goals; total and general disarmament;\nglobalization and interdependence; international\nmigration and development; human rights; and human\ncloning. I shall limit myself to a brief presentation of\nthe Holy See\u2019s position regarding some of those issues.\nAmong the Millennium Goals, pride of place\ngoes to the theme of poverty and development. I say\npride of place, because it concerns the right to\nsubsistence of hundreds of millions of human beings,\nsurviving \u2014 as best they can \u2014 below the threshold of\nwhat is necessary, as well as tens of millions of\nundernourished children unjustly deprived of the right\nto live.\nIn order to find a lasting solution to those\ninhumane conditions, it is necessary to progress, under\nthe aegis of the United Nations, towards a more\nflexible and more just international trade system.\nFurthermore, financial structures are needed which\nfavour development and the cancellation of foreign\ndebt for the poorest countries. Likewise, the results of\nscientific research and technology must be generously\nshared, especially in the field of health.\nOn that matter I need say no more, since the Holy\nSee\u2019s position has already been presented once again\nby the Cardinal Secretary of State, at the conference on\nhunger and poverty held in New York on\n20 September. I repeat only this: the urgency of the\nsituation cannot tolerate delay. It is a question of\njustice.\nOf immediate relevance to the supreme good of\npeace is the theme of total and general disarmament. If\nit is true that the production and sale of arms to other\ncountries endangers peace, it follows that severe and\neffective international controls are needed. The\ncommitment of the United Nations in that area is\nattested to by the various conventions it has supported\nwith reference to weapons of mass destruction as well\nas conventional weapons. But we are only at the\nbeginning of a long process, with huge economic\ninterests as obstacles along our path towards peace.\nThe problem of weapons of mass destruction is\nclearly to be distinguished from that of conventional\nweapons; but the latter have a terrible and unending\ncontemporary relevance in the numerous armed\nconflicts that stain the world with blood, and also in\nterrorism.\nRegional armed conflicts are so numerous that\nthere is no time to list them all. However, there are\nsome that I cannot omit to mention. Above all there is\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is not\nsimply contained within the narrow territorial\nboundaries of the region itself. Those directly involved\nare the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\nAuthority, and they have the grave duty to demonstrate\ntheir desire for peace. With this end in view, a road\nmap has been drawn up and formally accepted by both\nparties; may they proceed along it with determination\nand courage.\n26\n\nBut that conflict is also followed with intense\ninterest and often with passion by large sections of\nhumanity. The Catholic Church, present in Palestine\nfor 2,000 years, invites all concerned to turn their\nbacks on any action likely to destroy confidence and to\nutter generous words of peace and make bold gestures\nof peace. And if peace is the fruit of justice, let it not\nbe forgotten \u2014 as Pope John Paul II has reminded\nus \u2014 that there can be no justice without forgiveness;\nindeed, without mutual forgiveness.\nThen there is the Iraqi conflict. The position of\nthe Holy See concerning the military action of 2002-\n2003 is well known. Everyone can see that it did not\nlead to a safer world either inside or outside Iraq. The\nHoly See believes it is now imperative to support the\npresent Iraqi Government in its efforts to bring the\ncountry to normality and to a political system that is\nsubstantially democratic and in harmony with the\nvalues of its historic traditions.\nThe Holy See is gravely concerned about various\nAfrican countries scarred by bloodshed arising from\nmutual conflicts and even more from internal strife.\nThey need active international solidarity: more\nspecifically, and connaturally, the African Union needs\nto intervene authoritatively so as to bring all legitimate\ninterested parties around a negotiating table. The\nAfrican Union has already demonstrated its ability to\nact successfully in some cases: it deserves recognition\nand support.\nI have mentioned the theme of terrorism, an\naberrant phenomenon, utterly unworthy of man, which\nhas already assumed global dimensions: today no State\ncan presume to be safe from it. Hence, it seems\nobvious that terrorists can be effectively challenged\nonly through a concerted, multilateral approach,\nrespecting the ius gentium, and not through a policy of\nunilateralism. No one is in any doubt that the fight\nagainst terrorism means, first and foremost,\nneutralizing its active breeding grounds. But the\nunderlying causes are many and complex: political,\nsocial, cultural, religious; for this reason, what is still\nmore important is long-term action, directed, with\nforesight and patience, at its roots, designed to stop its\nspreading further and to extinguish its deadly\ncontagious effects.\nThe Holy See, and the entire Catholic Church, is\nactively involved in this work. It is involved through\nits educational and charitable institutions, which,\nwherever they are, are committed to raising the cultural\nand social levels of the populations, without any\ndiscrimination, especially on religious grounds; it is\ninvolved through interreligious dialogue, which has\ngrown in intensity ever since the Second Vatican\nEcumenical Council. The Holy See will always be\ngrateful to the authorities of other religions that\ndemonstrate openness to such dialogue, and also to the\ncivil authorities that encourage it, without any political\ninterference, respecting the distinction between the\nreligious and the civil sphere and the fundamental\nhuman right to freedom of religion.\nThe right to freedom of religion is sanctioned,\ntogether with other fundamental rights, in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations on\n10 December 1948. Such fundamental human rights\nstand or fall together. And man stands or falls with\nthem.\nFor this reason, every effort has to be made to\ndefend them in all fields. For this to happen, one\nparticular danger must be avoided, which is found\ntoday in various countries and social settings. It is the\nidea that these fundamental human rights, as\nsanctioned by the Universal Declaration, are\nexpressions of a particular culture and are therefore\nhighly relative. No, at heart, they are expressions of the\nhuman being as such, even if the fact remains that, at\ndifferent times and in different cultures, they may have\nbeen and may still be differently applied, in more or\nless adequate and acceptable ways.\nAmong the fundamental rights, or rather foremost\namong them, as the Universal Declaration explicitly\nstates, is the right to life of every individual. The Holy\nSee could say a great deal about the right to life of\nevery individual, because the essence of its message is\nthe gospel of life.\nThe question of human cloning comes under the\nsame broad heading. In a few weeks, this General\nAssembly will resume its debate on human cloning. In\nthis respect, the Holy See is pleased to reaffirm its\ncommitment to support the advancement of medical\nscience, conducted always in a manner that respects\nhuman dignity, because it offers healing and cures for\nvarious diseases. With this end in view, the Holy See\nreiterates its support for the procurement and use of\nadult stem cells and believes that the way forward is to\n27\n\ndraw up and implement a clear convention that will\nresult in a comprehensive ban on human cloning.\n\u201cWhereas recognition of the inherent dignity and\nof the equal and inalienable rights of all members\nof the human family is the foundation of freedom,\njustice and peace in the world,\u201d\nSo begins the preamble to the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. It is one of the many undeniable merits\nof the United Nations to have proposed to the\nconscience of all humanity, more than 50 years ago,\nthese secure principles for progress towards peace.\nOver the years, however, the United Nations has\nneeded to adapt its procedures to take account of\ndevelopments on the world political scene so that its\nwork for the promotion of peace can become more\neffective. The first results of the high-level commission\nset up for this purpose by Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan were published last June. The Holy See will be\nable to offer some explicit evaluation on the occasion\nof the debate on the subject to be held next week.\nFor now, I should simply like to recall Pope John\nPaul II\u2019s words for this year\u2019s International Day of\nPeace. He reminded us that humanity today is in a new\nand more difficult phase of its genuine development,\nand he called for a greater degree of international\nordering. This could be brought about by giving\norganizations like the United Nations special\nprerogatives to facilitate action to prevent conflicts at\ntimes of international crisis, and also, when absolutely\nnecessary, humanitarian intervention \u2014 that is, action\naimed at disarming the aggressor.\nYet, the greater degree of international ordering\ncould be achieved still more effectively if the United\nNations were to rise to the status of a moral centre,\nwhere all nations of the world feel at home and\ndevelop a shared awareness of being, as it were, a\nfamily of nations.\nNow and in the future, the United Nations can\ncount on the Holy See to be not only an attentive\nPermanent Observer, but also a travelling companion,\never ready to support its complex and difficult activity,\nand also to collaborate in a spirit of freedom and\nfriendship with all the Member States."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, first\nof all I would like to congratulate you on your\nassumption of the important post of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Let me also\n21\n\npay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for his\nhighly professional and fruitful work accomplished at\nthe helm of the General Assembly.\nA year ago the Secretary-General stressed in this\nHall that the United Nations had reached a fork in the\nroad. This is still true today. We have a long list of\nproblems, but we do not have a clear vision of how to\ndeal with them. To choose the right way, to solve a\nconflict between wishes and resources, between\ndesirable and achievable, we should concentrate on\npriorities.\nLet me outline Ukraine\u2019s vision of the most\nimportant issues on which the United Nations should\nfocus. The tragedy in the Russian city of Beslan and\nother recent terrorist attacks leave no doubt that fight\nagainst terrorism is truly the major priority. We express\nour sympathy to the victims and strongly condemn\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nThe underlying reason for terrorism is to create\nchaos, to disrupt the global system of peace and\nsecurity established and promoted by our Organization.\nThus, we have to act collectively. We have to overcome\nold prejudices and to establish a spirit of confidence\nand a new culture of international cooperation, which\nwould embrace the whole spectrum of political, law\nenforcement and security instruments.\nCreation of a new and efficient system of\ninformation exchange on terrorism will help prevent\nnew attacks and save priceless human lives. We\nsupport the views expressed by previous speakers on\nthe need for a broader approach to address the complex\nand interdependent nature of security. To prevent\nterrorist acts and to eliminate the roots of terrorism, the\nUnited Nations must promote better understanding, a\nglobal rapprochement between various civilizations\nand religions. There are universal values of peace and\nsecurity which are a cornerstone of our Organization\nand which can serve as a basis for a new atmosphere of\ntolerance in the world.\nUkraine, as a country actively participating in the\nstabilization forces in Iraq, is concerned by the terrorist\ninsurgency and continuing violence there. Although the\nsituation in Iraq remains difficult, there are some\npositive trends. Ukraine welcomes the transition of\npower to the Iraqi people and the formation of the\ninterim government. It is important to ensure effective\nimplementation of the timetable for a comprehensive\npolitical transition process in the country, particularly\nthrough the holding of free and fair elections, with the\nhighest standards possible under the current\ncircumstances.\nSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004) clearly\nenvisages a central role for the United Nations in a\ncomprehensive political transition in the country and in\nthe reconstruction process. However, the Iraqi crisis\nand the international fight against terrorism have\nrevealed the need to strengthen the United Nations as a\nkey instrument for safeguarding international peace\nand security.\nInstitutional reform of the United Nations,\nincluding the Security Council, which should become\ntruly representative and balanced, is an important task.\nWe understand the reasons behind the suggestions to\nenlarge the Council in both its permanent and non-\npermanent membership, and we are ready to carefully\nconsider relevant proposals. In this respect, Ukraine\nattaches primary importance to the allocation of an\nadditional non-permanent seat to the Group of Eastern\nEuropean States.\nBut reform must not only involve some structural\nchanges. We should not have to embark on reform\nevery 20 years when a new balance of power emerges\nin the international arena. Universal criteria and a\ncommon understanding of threats and challenges are\nnecessary to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour Organization in the twenty-first century.\nWe fully share the view expressed by the\nSecretary-General at the beginning of the general\ndebate that the rule of law should be a priority both at\nhome and in international affairs. We look forward to\nthe outcome of the deliberations of the High-level\nPanel on Threats, Challenges and Change. United\nNations authority should be increased, particularly\nthrough its greater involvement in conflict prevention\nand resolution. As President Leonid Kuchma of\nUkraine emphasized, conflict prevention should be\npivotal to the philosophy of United Nations work in the\nnew millennium.\nIn our region, frozen conflicts in Abkhazia, South\nOssetia, Nagorny-Karabakh and Transdnistria need to\nbe solved as soon as possible.\nAs one of the major contributors to United\nNations peacekeeping operations and the largest in\nEurope, Ukraine is deeply concerned by the increasing\ndanger to the lives of peacekeeping personnel. We\n22\n\nstand for the universal application of the Convention\non the Safety of United Nations and Associated\nPersonnel and call upon all Member States to abide\nstrictly by its provisions.\nThe role of the United Nations in the field of non-\nproliferation and disarmament should also be\nstrengthened. This year Ukraine will mark the tenth\nanniversary of its accession to the Treaty on Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Its landmark\ndecision to eliminate the third largest nuclear arsenal\nand to relinquish nuclear capability has significantly\nenhanced the international non-proliferation regime\nand global security. We hope that Ukraine\u2019s positive\nexample will be followed by other countries that now\nentertain the erroneous idea that they can protect their\nsecurity through access to nuclear weapons.\nAll achievements by the international community\nmay come to naught if our populations succumb to\nHIV/AIDS. This disease has killed more people\nannually than have all armed conflicts on the planet\nadded together. We highly appreciate the work carried\nout by the United Nations, its specialized agencies and\nby the Secretary-General personally to combat this\npandemic.\nUkraine supports the initiative to hold a high-\nlevel meeting in June next year to review progress in\nthe implementation of the Declaration of Commitment\non HIV/AIDS. At the same time, we believe that\nmillions of our infected fellow citizens need concrete\naction. We are convinced that HIV/AIDS poses a\nfundamental challenge, not only to human health and\nwell-being, but also to the very security of our world.\nIn this regard, we attach particular significance to the\nOrganization\u2019s declaration of a global emergency alert\nin the fight against HIV/AIDS. The main focus must be\nplaced on prevention and treatment of the disease. As\nUkraine President Kuchma stressed last year at the\nhigh-level meeting on HIV/AIDS, we need to elaborate\na clear system to encourage sponsorship of medical\nprojects as well as to expand the educational campaign\non preventing the pandemic.\nIn the same vein, a leading role should be played\nby the mass media. Ukraine has launched an active\nmass media campaign with the involvement of all\nsocial groups, and we are ready to lead a regional\nmedia movement in the prevention of HIV/AIDS.\nAnother pressing problem is trafficking in\npersons, especially women and children. Ukraine\nspares no effort in addressing this issue. This year\nUkraine became a party to the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\nits two Optional Protocols. However, tackling those\nissues requires a comprehensive approach and the close\ncooperation of the international community. We need\nto create a truly functioning and efficient mechanism to\ncombine the efforts of the countries of origin, transit\nand destination.\nEffective strategies to combat human trafficking\nshould be based on both law enforcement measures and\nimprovement of the economic and social conditions of\npotential victims. Ukraine welcomes the appointment\nof the Commission on Human Rights Special\nRapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in\nwomen and children, and stands ready to render every\nsupport in implementing the respective mandates.\nLast year the world observed the seventieth\nanniversary of the horrible genocidal famine, which\ntook the lives of over 7 million Ukrainian people.\nTaking this opportunity I wish once again to express\nour gratitude to all States that signed the joint\nstatement on the seventieth anniversary of the great\nfamine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine \u2014 Holodomor \u2014 or\nwhose parliaments adopted acts of condemnation and\nsympathy, and to all organizations and individuals that\ntook part in the events to honour the victims of the\ngreat famine.\nThe international community must thoroughly\nstudy that phenomenon in order to prevent its\nrecurrence. We hope that the newly appointed Special\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of\nGenocide will also duly focus on this issue.\nAlmost two decades have passed since Ukraine\nwas struck by another tragedy \u2014 the Chernobyl\ndisaster. Ukraine together with other interested\ndelegations put forth an initiative to hold, within the\nframework of the sixtieth session of United Nations\nGeneral Assembly in spring 2006, a special plenary\nmeeting to commemorate the victims of the Chernobyl\ndisaster.\nUkraine has fulfilled its commitments related to\nthe closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. What\nneeds to be done today is to construct a new safe\nconfinement. We expect that funds for this purpose\npromised by the Group of Seven in 1995 will be fully\nprovided.\n23\n\nChernobyl remains a searing wound, which\nproves every day how fragile our world is and how\neasily nature can be damaged. No one should doubt our\ncommitment to the preservation of our environment.\nThat is why Ukraine is so sensitive to environmental\nprotection, whether it concerns building of roads,\nconstruction of new power plants or the reopening of a\nnavigable waterway.\nIt was fashionable some years ago to criticize the\nUnited Nations for its inability to solve the most\nimportant problems. Today we all come to this\nAssembly with the ever-stronger conviction that there\nis no alternative to our Organization.\nI am confident that despite all obstacles and\ndoubts of the past, we can act for the attainment of the\nUnited Nations goals that are common to all of us. We\ncan act swiftly, collectively and with a vision."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, I\nwould like to thank Mr. Julian Hunte, President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, for his\ndedication and hard work and to welcome Mr. Jean\nPing, Minister of State, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\nCooperation and la Francophonie of the Republic of\nGabon, as President of the Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession.\nOn this occasion, I would also like to commend\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts to\nmake the United Nations more effective, and especially\nfor taking the initiative to establish a High-level Panel\non Threats, Challenges and Change to address United\nNations reform and to propose recommendations to the\nGeneral Assembly. The member States all look forward\nto seeing and considering those eagerly awaited\nrecommendations.\nIn 2000, the Millennium Declaration, a landmark\ndocument, manifested our strong will to face the most\npressing challenges of our time. The Millennium\nDevelopment Goals have become fundamental\nbenchmarks in our efforts to achieve economic growth\nand sustainable development. Over the past four years,\ntheir implementation at the global and regional levels\nhas proved to be successful in some countries, while\nmany developing countries, especially the least\ndeveloped, have had difficulties in attaining those\ngoals due to unfavourable conditions. In that context,\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic views the high-\nlevel plenary meeting to review the implementation of\nthe Millennium Declaration, scheduled for next year, as\na crucial opportunity for the international community\nto take stock of the progress made and to develop\nappropriate measures to secure the necessary financial\nresources for better achievements in the years ahead.\nThe international situation continues to be\nmarked by rapid and complex evolution. In that\ncontext, peace and international security must be\npreserved at all costs. The Non-Aligned Movement, at\nits ministerial conference held in Durban, South Africa,\nfrom 17 to 19 August 2004, reiterated its commitment\nto multilateralism in the maintenance of international\npeace and security. The strengthening and promotion of\nthe multilateral process would certainly contribute to\nthe world\u2019s efforts effectively to address international\nchallenges.\nToday, weapons of mass destruction \u2014 be they\nchemical, biological or nuclear \u2014 all pose major\nthreats to peace and security at the regional and global\nlevels and are far from being totally eliminated.\n2\n\nTherefore, we should all work collectively to ensure\nthat those inhumane weapons disappear from the face\nof the Earth.\nTerrorism continues to bring disaster to humanity\nand endangers national and international security. The\ninternational community is urged to further cooperate\nat the national, regional and international levels in the\nfight against terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. All acts of terrorism, wherever and by\nwhomever committed, are criminal and unjustifiable.\nTo that end, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nreaffirms its position to continue to cooperate with the\ninternational community based on the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, international law and relevant\ninternational conventions.\nThe year 2005 will mark the fiftieth anniversary\nof the Asian-African Conference. The commemoration\nof this golden jubilee will be a crucial opportunity to\nsolemnly reaffirm the validity of the core principles of\nthe Bandung spirit, which are solidarity, friendship and\ncooperation, and which continue to serve as an\neffective foundation for resolving global problems and\npromoting good relations among the countries and the\npeoples of the world.\nRecently, the increasingly deteriorating security\nsituation in Iraq has been cause for concern. The Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic expresses the hope that\na peaceful solution can be found to achieve peace and\nstability and to ensure the well-being of the Iraqi\npeople.\nWe commend the efforts being made to find a\npeaceful solution to the Korean Peninsular issue\nthrough the convening of three rounds of six-party\ntalks. We hope that all parties concerned will pursue\nthose talks in order to achieve permanent peace and\nsecurity in the Korean Peninsula, thus creating\nfavourable conditions for peaceful reunification.\nViolence continues unabated in the occupied\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. Such\nviolence will hurt the peace efforts in the Middle East\nand prolong the suffering of the peoples of the region.\nThus, we urge the parties concerned to engage in\nserious dialogue, settle their conflict and realize the\nvision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by\nside in peace within secure and recognized borders, in\naccordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nLast month, at its Durban Ministerial Conference,\nthe Non-Aligned Movement called once again upon the\nGovernment of the United States to put an end to the\neconomic, financial and trade embargo against Cuba.\nThat unilateral embargo, which has caused immense\nmaterial losses and economic damage to the people of\nCuba, runs counter to the United Nations Charter and\ninternational law. It is time that the embargo was lifted.\nCapitalizing on the momentum achieved at the\nhistoric international ministerial conference at Almaty,\nKazakhstan, to address the special needs of landlocked\ndeveloping countries (LLDCs), the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic, as Chairman of the Group of\nLLDCs, has spared no efforts to bring benefits to these\nvulnerable developing countries. We would like to\nconvey our appreciation to eleventh session of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development,\nwhich recognized LLDCs as small and vulnerable\neconomies. We hope that such special recognition will\nbe granted by other international forums and\norganizations, in particular the World Trade\nOrganization, as gaining access to international\nmarkets for products of interest to our countries will\nsignificantly help to overcome our geographical\nhandicap as landlocked States.\nThe global illicit drug problem and related crime\nremain an issue of concern to the world community.\nOwing to its cross-border and international nature, this\nproblem can be dealt with effectively only through\ninternational cooperation. In an effort to contribute to\nthe fight against this scourge, the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic continues to build and intensify\ncooperation at the national, regional and international\nlevels. As a result, opium cultivation in our country\ndeclined significantly from 2003 to 2004, and we will\nstrive to eliminate opium cultivation by 2005. I take\nthis opportunity to appeal to the international\ncommunity to continue to grant financial support to\nassist our country in addressing a number of\nchallenges, namely the treatment of opium addicts, the\ncreation of new and sustainable employment and the\nprovision of necessary infrastructures to prevent\nformer opium poppy growers from replanting.\nOver the past year, the Lao people of all ethnic\norigins, all walks of life and all religions have been\nliving in solidarity and harmony. Social and political\nstability across the country remained solid. The\neconomy enjoyed a sustained growth rate of 6.5 per\ncent. The poverty of the people has been gradually\n3\n\nreduced, and external relations of cooperation have\nbeen broadened extensively. Later this year, the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic will be hosting the 10th\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nSummit and other related summits with ASEAN\ndialogue partners. On that occasion, a number of\nimportant documents will be adopted, aiming to\naccelerate regional integration and the establishment of\nthe ASEAN community by 2020.\nIn its nearly 60 years of existence, the United\nNations, has played its role in promoting international\npeace and security and socio-economic development. It\nhas had much success. As we enter the twenty-first\ncentury, our world today is still confronted with\nnumerous complex problems including wars, armed\nconflicts, terrorism, global crime, human trafficking,\nglobal warming, environmental degradation, HIV/\nAIDS and other diseases and the marginalization of\ndeveloping countries, in particular the three most\nvulnerable groups among them: the least developed\ncountries, the landlocked developing countries and the\nsmall island developing States. The international\ncommunity should cooperate and work collectively\nthrough the United Nations to address the global\nchallenges of our time.\nThe United Nations needs to be reformed if the\nOrganization is to be more effective and more\ndemocratic. The General Assembly should also have an\nimportant and more active role to play in the\nmanagement of world affairs. With respect to the\nSecurity Council, we wish to reaffirm the position of\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, first expressed\nmany years ago, that there should be an increase in the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members\nfrom the developed and developing countries, in\naccordance with the principle of equitable geographical\ndistribution and taking into account the relative\nimportance of the various countries. In the same\ncontext, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nsupports Japan, Germany and India as permanent\nmembers in a new, expanded Security Council.\nAll this would greatly contribute to achieving our\nultimate goal of making the United Nations, our\nuniversal Organization, an organization that can gain\nthe trust and the confidence of Member States."

        "file_text": "Allow me at\nthe outset to join others who have warmly\ncongratulated you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. I\nwish you every success in your important undertaking,\nwhich will enjoy the full support of the Romanian\ndelegation.\nFor some years now, this great worldwide\ngathering has opened in the wake of deadly terrorist\nattacks that require us to respond as one to voice strong\ncondemnation of all terrorist acts and a commitment to\ncontributing ever more energetically to the affirmation\nof effective multilateralism that will make global\naction increasingly effectual.\nIn that context, I cannot fail briefly to address the\nissue of the struggle against terrorism, which is more\nurgent today than ever before. Since September 2001,\nthe level of violence of acts of terrorism \u2014 perpetrated\nin the name of ideological, territorial, religious or\nethnic differences and incompatibilities \u2014 has risen\ndramatically.\nAt the same time, the very nature of terrorist acts\nhas changed. The complexity and scale of such\nbarbarism, claiming the lives of hundreds or even\nthousands of innocent victims \u2014 often children, as in\nthe recent incident in Beslan \u2014 are indescribably grim\nand represent immense challenges. Yet another factor\nis at play in all this: the increase in the number of\nterrorist acts. In such conditions, the struggle against\nthat scourge \u2014 whose implications are not only\nimmediate, but also complex and global in nature \u2014 is\nan urgent and ongoing obligation for all States.\nRomania promptly and meaningfully joined the\nanti-terrorism campaign and has demonstrated its\nresolve to contribute to eradicating it. We believe,\nhowever, that the struggle to end terrorism must also\naddress its underlying causes, including poverty, and\nmust not be used as a pretext for flouting or violating\nhuman rights. If that were to occur, we would be\nplaying into the hands of the perpetrators of terrorist\nacts, who not only seek loss of life and devastation, but\nstrive above all to destroy symbols and values. On the\nother hand, promoting respect for human rights and\ndemocratic values is the only way to eliminate such\nmanifestations of hatred and violence.\nThe nature and, above all, the inherent dangers of\nthe current international context make the development\nof cooperation among all kinds of international actors,\n2\n\nState and non-State alike, increasingly urgent. As an\nOrganization that is universal by vocation and in\nlegitimacy, the United Nations must fully assume its\nrole as the driving force behind efforts to adapt to\nchanges in the international environment. In an\ninterdependent world, no single State is safe from such\ndangers or from threats to international peace and\nsecurity, including terrorism, the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, the increasing number of\nStates affected by instability, the growth of global\ndisparities, humanitarian crises, ethnic wars and intra-\nState wars.\nManaging such risks requires a comprehensive\nand coherent approach on the part of the United\nNations, including through the promotion of preventive\npolitical and diplomatic measures, such as the\nstrengthening of international treaties and conventions\non combating terrorism and the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction; efforts to make\ninternational export control regimes and specialized\ninternational structures more effective; and, in extreme\ncases, recourse to coercive measures, in accordance\nwith the United Nations Charter.\nOur Organization has one strong and complex\ntool at its disposal in meeting such challenges. I refer\nto the Security Council, in which Romania is striving\nto make a real contribution to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the establishment\nof a world climate of stability, with particular emphasis\non fighting terrorism, preventing conflicts and\nhumanitarian crisis situations, maintaining the unity of\nCouncil members and supporting consensus solutions,\nand encouraging cooperation on stabilization between\nthe United Nations and regional organizations. With\nrespect to that last issue, I would note that Romania\nhas been and continues to be interested in cooperation\nbetween the global Organization and the regional and\nsubregional pillars. Given the current international\ncontext, that is of major importance.\n(spoke in English)\nThe need to speed up the reform of the United\nNations is more urgent than ever. The series of\nchallenges, more or less new, that the Organization has\nto face in the twenty-first century make its reform a\npriority if its structures and working methods are to\nadapt to the present realities. The terms of reference\ncontinue to be efficiency, adaptability and progress.\nRomania looks forward to the recommendations of the\nSecretary-General on the report of the eminent persons\nso that we may embrace, together with other States, a\ncollective effort that cannot afford delay.\nWe hope that the sixtieth anniversary of the\nOrganization\u2019s establishment will mark significant\nprogress in the process of adapting the United Nations\nto the new challenges, and especially the Security\nCouncil, the essential body in the management of\nworld peace and stability. Our relation to that organ, as\na non-permanent member, increases our conviction that\na new configuration, closely reflecting current realities\nby increasing the number of permanent and non-\npermanent seats, will consolidate the representative\nprofile of the Security Council and thus its authority\nand efficiency.\nI cannot ignore another aspect of our\ncontemporary world. Both a source of challenges and a\nmost generous framework for opportunities, the\nphenomenon of globalization is unavoidable and\naffects us all. Given its nature, the United Nations is\nideally placed to manage the phenomenon, particularly\nby correcting its consequences.\nIn that context, Romania fully embraces the\nGlobal Compact Initiative of our Secretary-General,\nwhich needs support and strengthening. All Member\nStates must promote regional and transcontinental\nintegration as vehicles and instruments of a harnessed\nglobalization. In this case, the European Union stands\nas a success story, since it acts as a vector not only of\neconomic integration, but also of democratic values\nand human rights. The United Nations has to try to find\nways to adjust the rules of the world market in order to\ndiminish, in the medium and long terms, the big gaps\nthat exist between the rich countries and the poor.\nAnother priority in our efforts to harness\nglobalization is the need to enhance coordination\namong the specialized agencies and institutions of the\nUnited Nations system in their work to ensure the\ndiffusion of information technology at a lower cost. We\nneed to show more determination in our attempts to\ndecrease the gaps in this field, and to guarantee the\nevolution of less developed countries from a state of\nmarginalization to one catalysed by knowledge-based\ndevelopment.\nAllow me to turn now to another essential factor\nfor a better future, one that Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan also underlined in his introductory speech \u2014\nthe rule of law. The validity of the principles of the\n3\n\nCharter of the United Nations have not only withstood\nthe test of time, but they have also been reaffirmed by\na whole new network of international agreements,\nmandatory standards and norms of action to which\nStates have voluntarily acceded, mechanisms for the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and monitoring\ncommitments.\nAs a proof of our faith in the international law\nsystem, Romania appealed this year for the first time to\nthe International Court of Justice \u2014 the main judicial\nbody of the United Nations \u2014 to resolve a question of\nmaritime delimitation. Romania also appealed to an\ninternational investigation commission to solve the\ncase of an infrastructure works project with cross-\nborder impact on the Bistroe Channel in the Danube\nDelta. Our appeal concerns the need for close\ncollaboration in order to protect a unique and fragile\nplace, a UNESCO world heritage site.\nOur efforts towards an effective multilateralism\nalso involve us in other major issues on the United\nNations agenda. Romania has promptly joined, and\nsubstantially contributed to, international efforts for the\nstabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan and\nIraq, in keeping with its long history of participation in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and the\nprovision of assistance in post-conflict phases.\nThe global vocation and aspirations of my\ncountry are closely related to its European destiny. The\nfocus of Romanian diplomacy is therefore oriented\ntowards the democratic stabilization of our\nneighbouring region and its effective connection to a\nunited Europe. For too long that region has been\naffected by wars and all kinds of tensions, often acute\nones. Under such circumstances, Romania can only\nsupport, alongside all of Europe, a boost to democracy,\neconomic development and a long-lasting stabilization\nof the countries in the region.\nAt the same time, Romania is ready to contribute\nto the stability and development of all countries in the\nBlack Sea region. We hope to turn this strategic area \u2014\nwith its close connections to other regions of immense\npotential, including the Mediterranean Basin, the\nCaucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East \u2014 into a\ncooperation and security zone.\nI cannot conclude without making a brief\nreference to another theme to which Romania attaches\nparticular importance. My country strongly supports\nconcerted action to prevent the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. In an international\ncontext that is often volatile and defined by a growing\ncomplexity and increased interdependence, we cannot\nignore the necessity for immediate action, using the\nmeans offered by our global Organization, in particular\nthe Security Council Committee established pursuant\nto resolution 1540 (2004)."

        "file_text": "As\nFrench is the most widely recognized official language\nin the Central Africa subregion, I should like to begin\nmy statement by addressing a few words to the\nAssembly in that common language.\nI would like to say how pleased I am to be here\nwith you today, Mr. President \u2014 you in your capacity\nas the President of the General Assembly and me in\nmine as President of my country. I am also pleased to\naddress the Assembly in order to speak on behalf of the\npeople of Sao Tome and Principe.\nI shall now deliver my address in Portuguese \u2014\nwhich, as the Assembly is aware, is the official\nlanguage of Sao Tome and Principe.\n(spoke in Portuguese; English text furnished by the\ndelegation)\nAllow me, at the outset, to congratulate you most\nwarmly, Mr. President, on your election as President of\nthe fifty-ninth session on the General Assembly, whose\nproceedings will undoubtedly benefit from your\npersonal qualities and your experience in international\nrelations. Gabon and my country, Sao Tome and\nPrincipe, have long enjoyed a very good relationship of\ncooperation at various levels, and my delegation\nwishes you success in your new functions.\nMay I also thank the President\u2019s predecessor,\nPresident Julian Robert Hunte of Saint Lucia, for the\nexcellent work he has done.\nOn behalf of people of Sao Tome and Principe, I\nwould like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for\nhis relentless efforts and dedication at the service of\nthe goals of the United Nations, and for his work in\npromoting peace and development.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking\nplace during a particularly complex international\nsituation. Violence and the violation of human rights\nare increasing. The United Nations must play its role as\na matter of priority; otherwise world order could\ncollapse. More than ever before, Governments must\ngive a universal forum like this the responsibility to\nrebuild international order on the basis of peace,\n2\n\nrespect for human rights, security and cooperation for\ndevelopment. Unilateralism must be put aside. We have\nto work together for a better world.\nIntolerance, terrorism, occupation, discrimination,\norganized crime and social injustice are some of the\nsources of today\u2019s open conflicts. Religious differences\nand drug trafficking in some countries are driving\npeople to high levels of violence and destruction. We\nthe people the United Nations have to do our best to\nstop those atrocities, or unprotected groups of society\nwill disappear and the spiral of violence could spread\nout of control.\nDarfur is an example of discrimination and\natrocity. We call on Sudan\u2019s Government to fulfil all\nthe provisions contained in Security Council resolution\n1556 (2004), which was adopted on 30 July.\nIt is completely unacceptable that 50 million\npeople worldwide have become refugees or have been\ninternally displaced as a result of having been driven\nfrom their homes by war, persecution and human rights\nabuses. We now needed concrete action by leaders and\npeoples to ensure that the perpetrators of criminal\nbehaviour are brought to justice, thereby rebuilding\nconfidence among peoples and nations, but especially\nto address the root causes of violence.\nSmall island States will meet in Mauritius to\nassess the progress made since the Global Conference\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, which was held in Barbados.\nProgress in the implantation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action has been mixed. At Mauritius,\nkey issues will be reviewed and decisions and\nrecommendations will be made with regard to the\nquestions of climate change, natural and environmental\ndisasters, fresh water, land resources, waste\nmanagement, tourism, energy, transport, biodiversity\nand coastal and marine resources. All those are issues\naffecting the ecosystems of small islands as a result of\nglobal warming. They can only be solved gradually and\nif the international community increases resources\neffectively to support the sustainable development of\nsmall island States. We would like to take this\nopportunity to thank the international community for\neverything it has done to date. I would like to extend a\nspecial thanks to the Government of Mauritius for its\nefforts to organize the special international conference.\nAs an island nation, Sao Tome and Principe\ncontinues to see its very existence threatened by global\nwarming. Our shorelines are eroding and our national\nterritory is shrinking as the seas rise. Is my small\ncountry to end up nothing but a tiny volcanic peak\nsticking out above the waves, with the last of our\npeople clinging to the land left unclaimed by the rising\nsea? The Kyoto Protocol must be implemented by all\nfor the benefit of all.\nThe Governments of Africa launched the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), aiming\nspecifically at optimally mobilizing both African and\ninternational resources and at harmonizing\ncontributions through a partnership based on mutual\ncommitments and balanced interests and responsibilities.\nPeace, good governance, security and development are\nchallenges that all African Governments and peoples\nhave to face. They must create the conditions to\nachieve those goals. Those goals are far from being\nreached, given the numerous conflicts and the destructive\nand negatives effects of conflicts. My Government will\ncontinuously support NEPAD and will work to create\nthe foundations for its implementation.\nMost countries continue to face the challenge of\nHIV/AIDS and other diseases. In some parts of Africa\nHIV/AIDS is devastating entire families, societies,\ncultures and economies. Treatment is still expensive,\nand our economy has started to feel the negative effects\nof the disease. Unless there are additional resources and\nscientific investment to find a cure for HIV/AIDS, hope\nfor progress in Africa will continue to be far from reach.\nIt is not only health problems that afflict poor\ncountries. Globalization affects some because few have\nall the necessary conditions to develop trade and\ncommerce and to take advantage of new technologies.\nThe latest efforts by the World Trade Organization in\nGeneva are an example of the fact that those who have\ntoo much could make a difference by giving away a\nlittle to poor countries. If that is not done, we will\ncontinue to face discriminatory tariffs and to\nexperience erosion in quality of life.\nMy country regrets that international relations in\nsome parts of the world have deteriorated to the point\nwhere extreme violence, destruction and violation of\nhuman rights and the environment are daily facts of\nlife, and where the use and abuse of dangerous\nweapons is endemic. We also regret that refugees and\nchildren are among the targets in those conflicts.\nTragedies cannot be our destiny. Tragedies and\nnatural disasters such as the ones we face in Iraq, the\n3\n\nMiddle East, Bangladesh and some countries in Africa\nand elsewhere are testimony of the fact that mankind is\nmoving towards facing bigger challenges. My\nGovernment thinks that multilateralism under the\nframework of the United Nations is the only way for\nthe international community to be able to achieve\nlasting peace and development.\nTerrorism around the world is causing\ndestruction, destabilizing Governments and killing\npeople in places such as Madrid, the Middle East and\nelsewhere. We are confronted by a dilemma, because\nthus far all the strategies employed to fight this scourge\nare not producing significant results. Under the\nauthority of the Security Council, we must guarantee\nthe universality of, and compliance with, non-\nproliferation treaties.\nMy Government supports the recommendations\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Timor-Leste. The\nUnited Nations Mission of Support in East Timor is a\nsuccess we cannot ignore.\nThe universality of the Organization must be a fact,\nand all countries have to be represented. Taiwan is not\nrepresented. We call upon the international community\nto address the issue of Taiwan\u2019s representation. Despite\nits small size, Taiwan offers development aid to a large\nnumber of countries. Taiwan has all the elements to be an\nactive member of the main international organizations. A\nlook at its economy, trade relations, commerce,\nfinance, application of new technologies and support\nfor many countries reveals facts that we cannot ignore\nany longer.\nWe would also like to refer to Cuba. Economic\nembargo is a severe sanction. It violates the Charter of\nthe United Nations and international law. I would like\nto request that the General Assembly lend its assistance\nto bring about an end to the economic embargo against\nCuba. The cold war era is behind us, and a people in\nneed simply cannot continue to be the object of the\npolitical interest of part of the electorate in Florida.\nIn Sao Tome and Principe we are working very\nhard to consolidate our young democracy and to create\na solid foundation for sound development. Following\nthe agreement signed among the Government, the\ninternational community and the military \u2014 which\nmounted a coup in Sao Tome and Principe in 2003 \u2014\nwe organized a national forum that brought all\nsegments of our society to the table to bring their views\ncloser together and to draw up recommendations in\norder to avoid more instability in the country.\nOn the economic front, we are preparing the\ncountry for a new era based on oil exploration and\nproduction. Our National Assembly has adopted a law\non the management of the revenues that we will\neventually receive from oil companies. That shows that\ncorruption will be fought, that the new generation will\nbe protected and that the country will have enough\nresources for development.\nThe Government and the people of Sao Tome and\nPrincipe adhere to the principles of respect for the\nsovereignty of all countries and following the path of\ndialogue, tolerance and mutual understanding among\npeoples. We call on all members of the United Nations\nto do likewise for the sake of a better world.\nI would like to conclude by expressing our\ngratitude to all countries Members of the United\nNations for the support given to our country at the time\nof the first-ever coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Sao Tome and Principe,\nin June 2003. I would also like to thank all the countries\nof Central Africa \u2014 including Congo (Brazzaville),\nwhich currently presides over the Economic\nCommunity of Central African States \u2014 for everything\nthey have done. I also wish to thank the President of\nthe General Assembly and our partners in Central\nAfrica and the African Union for their tireless efforts."

I extend sincere\ncongratulations to you and to the Government and\npeople of your country, Gabon, on behalf of the\ndelegation of Saint Lucia, and on my own behalf, and\npledge to work cooperatively with you in our common\nendeavour.\nThere is a personal note to my pledge of support\nand cooperation. Just one year ago, this Assembly\nhonoured my country and me by entrusting the\nleadership of the fifty-eighth session of this body to\nme. I am fully aware, therefore, of the tremendous\nresponsibility that falls to you as President, and OF the\ndemands and pressures of leadership of this, the United\nNations sole universal organ. In a relay of leadership\nthat began some 59 years ago, I have passed the baton\nto you, assured that this will be a productive and\nsuccessful fifty-ninth session.\nMy year as President of the General Assembly\ngave me a keener appreciation of the myriad tasks\nwhich the Secretary-General performs in the service of,\nand to inspire confidence in, the United Nations. The\nGovernment and people of Saint Lucia support him in\n26\n\nhis continuing contribution to our efforts to address the\ncritical issues facing our Organization and our world.\nThe picture of our twenty-first century world is\nfar different from that envisaged in the United Nations\nCharter. Instead of a world of peace, security and\neconomic and social progress, in which human rights,\nfundamental freedoms and international law are fully\nrespected, today our world is buffeted by poverty;\nhunger; the spread of endemic disease, including HIV/\nAIDS; conflicts; war; terrorism, and other grave\nproblems.\nThis is so despite the combined effort of the\nUnited Nations system and the enormous potential of\nthe Organization to live up to the ideals, principles and\npurposes of the Charter.\nThe United Nations is passing through a period of\nintense questioning and doubts as to its capacity and\nrelevance. It is the view of my Government that many\nof the doubts and questions stem from the continuing\nchallenge posed to the Organization to transform the\nideals of the Charter into action. Those questions and\ndoubts have been intensified by the concern that some\nof the Organization\u2019s most influential and powerful\nMember States might turn away from\nmultilateralism \u2014 the very foundation of the United\nNations \u2014 and follow the path of unilateral action.\nWe can and we must, stop our unique and\nindispensable Organization from being battered by the\ntides of these turbulent times. We must better enable it\nto address the myriad problems with which peoples and\nnations are grappling. And we must reaffirm its status\nas the world\u2019s foremost multilateral organization. But\nwe can only do so through our full commitment and\nresolve to ensure that the Organization and its Member\nStates live up to the ideals of the Charter.\nWe know that the Charter charges the United\nNations to achieve the solution of economic problems\ncooperatively. That puts the Organization on the front\nline of what, for many States, particularly those in the\ndeveloping world, appears to be a very long road to\nsustainable development. Nowadays, it is a road\nconstructed primarily around globalization and trade\nliberalization, which have mostly delivered on their\npromises of economic advancement to developed\ncountries, but have yet to deliver on those promises to\nmany others, mostly developing countries.\nIt cannot be disputed that current inconsistencies\nand inequities in the global trading system are\nwidening the gap between rich and poor, haves and\nhave-nots. It is not surprising, therefore, that\ndeveloping countries, particularly in the framework of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), are asserting\nthat globalization and trade liberalization should not\nundercut their sustainable development prospects, and\nthat there ought to be a fair and equitable global\ntrading system.\nAgricultural subsidies, market access, non-tariff\nbarriers to trade, low or falling commodity prices and\nspecial and differential treatment \u2014 all those issues\nbeg for constructive dialogue and decisive action,\nparticularly in the interest of the developing world.\nSpecific mandates for trade and development issues\nmay reside in other organizations, including the WTO,\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nBut the United Nations has a leading role to play in\nbringing coherence \u2014 here I underscore the word\ncoherence \u2014 to debate and policy-setting on those\nissues, in line with its Charter mandates. Its efforts in\nthat area have the full support of my Government.\nThe spate of deadly hurricanes that continue to\ntraverse the Caribbean region, have brought sharply\ninto focus the issues on which small island developing\nStates (SIDS), including Saint Lucia, have urged the\nUnited Nations and the international community to act.\nWe have reiterated, for example, that SIDS are\nvulnerable and that special and differential treatment,\nfair prices for commodities and development financing\nare essential to their sustainable development.\nIn just a few short weeks, hurricanes have\nbrought death and destruction throughout the\nCaribbean region, and, indeed, also to the Bahamas and\nthe United States. There was tragic loss of life in our\nsister Caribbean countries and territories \u2014 37 in\nGrenada, 20 in Jamaica; and even now, Haiti is still\ncounting the cost in lives lost. Property and\ninfrastructural damage was immense, particularly in\nGrenada. Hurricane \u201cIvan the terrible\u201d destroyed 90\nper cent of that country\u2019s physical infrastructure. I say\nto this Assembly that when a small island developing\nState loses 90 per cent of its physical infrastructure in\nthe space of a few hours, the challenge to that country\nis formidable.\nFor Grenada, it is like starting over. Grenada\nmust rebuild its infrastructure, economy,\n27\n\ncommunications systems, hospitals and schools,\neverything from the ground up to restore the quality of\nlife for its people. But how, and with what resources\nwill it rebuild? The member States of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) have made a commitment to\nGrenada, but can only assist to the extent that their\nmeans allow. Given their own resource constraints,\nhow far can that assistance be expected to go? The\nGovernment and people of Grenada and of CARICOM\nare highly appreciative of the condolences expressed in\nthis Hall, and for offers of assistance. But Grenada\nneeds much more. The Government of Saint Lucia\ncalls upon the international community to make a\ncommitment, as a matter of urgency, to the\nreconstruction of Grenada. We urge the convening, at\nan early date, of an international donor conference for\nthe purpose of mobilizing the resources required for\nthe reconstruction effort.\nIn keeping with the international commitment to\npromote the sustainable development of SIDS, Saint\nLucia calls upon the development partners and the\ninternational donor community to work together with\nSIDS to address their vulnerability and other critical\nissues frontally. The International Meeting for the 10-\nYear Review of the Barbados Programme of Action for\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, to be convened in Mauritius in\nJanuary 2005, gives everyone yet another opportunity\nto do so. Saint Lucia urges all States, developed and\ndeveloping, and particularly partners and donors, to be\nrepresented at the International Meeting at the highest\nlevel. In particular, we urge that commitments to\nprovide resources for the implementation of the\nBarbados Programme of Action, are kept.\nIndeed, this fifty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly will be a pivotal one in respect of\ncommitments made internationally, including those\nmade in the critical area of HIV/AIDS. The session is\nalso crucial to positioning us for the 2005\ncomprehensive review of commitments made in\nfurthering the United Nations development agenda,\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. Even as\nwe prepare for the High-level Plenary that will\nexamine the successes and failures in implementing the\noutcomes of more than a decade of United Nations\nconferences and summits in the economic and social\nfields, the disjuncture between what we have agreed\nand what we have done in the interest of the peoples of\nthe world becomes self-evident.\nWe must ask ourselves why it is that we continue\nto fail the poor, the hungry, the sick and the\ndisenfranchised among us, despite the numerous\nspecialized, high-level meetings we have convened to\naddress their condition? And why is it that we appear\nincapable of meaningful action beyond the boundaries\nof those meetings? If we cannot bring relief to the vast\nnumbers of marginalized and disadvantaged among us,\nif we cannot advance growth and development,\nparticularly for developing countries, we can rest\nassured that we will lose, or continue to lose, the\nconfidence of the people of the world. There is\ntherefore one message we must take into the 2005\nhigh-level event: agreement on outcomes is\nmeaningless if it is not followed by practical and\neffective implementation. We must act to implement\nand we must act now.\nIt is asserted that peace and security are not\npossible without development and that development is\nnot possible without peace and security. Saint Lucia\nagrees with this point; both are central to the purposes\nand principles of the Charter. We must, however,\nremain vigilant that our development agenda is not\neclipsed by a single-minded focus on conflict and war,\nwhich continue to cast a giant and deadly shadow over\nour world.\nThe function given to the United Nations \u2014 and\nparticularly to the Security Council \u2014 for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security is an\nexceptional one. How effectively the Organization\ncarries out that function is an important determinant of\nits standing in the eyes of the people who need it most\nand of world public opinion. Therefore, we must be\nconsistent in our global strategy for world peace and\nsecurity. Importantly, the United Nations must not be\nseen as an Organization so mesmerized by crises that it\nis slow to act decisively to address critical issues of life\nand death. The action we take, after all, should present\nour best hope for a more peaceful and more secure\nworld.\nWe know that conflict and war have costs that are\nincalculable, particularly in human lives, and can have\nno happy ending. Today, Iraq remains an unsettled,\nfractured country. The United Nations has a\nresponsibility to the people of Iraq to work with them\nto restore peace, security and prosperity to their\ncountry. In this, the Organization must ultimately take\nits lead from the people of Iraq; it is only they who can\ndevise uniquely Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems and\n28\n\ndetermine the kind of future to which they are\ncommitted.\nRegarding another crisis, my Government is\ndisappointed that the road map to peace in the Middle\nEast appears to have been put aside, and hopes that\nnew initiatives will be undertaken urgently towards\nsettling that long-standing situation, which continues to\ncause so much grief.\nEvery day, news stories and commentaries in the\nmedia remind us of the level of violence and perils in\nour world. The complex and uncertain threat of\nterrorists and terrorism constitutes a critical factor\ncontributing to the rising tide of violence, death and\ndestruction. Recently, terrorism became a reality for\nhundreds of victims in the Russian Federation. My\nGovernment extends its sympathy to the Government\nof Russia and to all victims of terrorism and their\nfamilies worldwide. Even with our best efforts, it is not\nalways possible to know where or when terrorists will\nstrike again, nor can we say with any certainty that\ncurrent efforts against terrorism have made the world a\nless dangerous place.\nWe can say, however, that the root causes of\nterrorism are symptomatic of problems, some\nseemingly intractable, around the globe; that terrorism\nis global in its impact; and that its solution must be\nglobal. In addressing the problem of terrorism, we\nmust also look to dealing with the hunger, poverty and\ninequities spoken of by President Lula da Silva of\nBrazil and many other concerned leaders, which are\ngiving rise to the hopelessness and despair being\nexperienced by millions and millions of people all over\nthe world. Greater efforts must be made to resolve\nthose critical problems.\nAs we survey the enormity of the challenges the\nUnited Nations and the global community face today,\nwe must ask ourselves: Is our 59-year old Organization\nequipped to confront those challenges? There is a\ncurrent of reform within the Organization. A series of\nprogressive steps were taken during the fifty-eighth\nsession, in particular, to advance revitalization of this\nAssembly. However, the Assembly still has to\ndemonstrate its ability to reconcile the interests of its\nmember States and to take action to implement the hard\nchoices which revitalization of this important universal\nforum requires. We must ensure that the gains made are\nnot reversed.\nDuring the fifty-eighth session, the debate was\nalso opened on Security Council reform, and some\nprogress was made to lift this matter out of its\nmoribund state. The Security Council must indeed be\nreformed, so that its actions can carry more weight and\nacceptance internationally. The Council must be\nexpanded to make it more representative of the\ngenerality of the membership, and a way must be found\nto address the serious concerns surrounding the veto\nprivilege. Recent reform initiatives should impact\nprocesses under way and practical recommendations\naimed at ensuring that the Security Council is adequate\nto its mandates, including those that might be taken up\nat the 2005 high-level plenary meeting.\nSince the establishment of the United Nations,\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society have\nworked constructively with this Organization to\naddress pressing global problems. We now have a\nreport on how the relationship might be made more\nbeneficial. It is our hope that the Assembly will\ncarefully consider this matter, as the support of non-\ngovernmental organizations and civil society is too\nimportant to be taken for granted.\nThe Government and people of Saint Lucia\nbelieve that confidence in the United Nations is being\nrestored. We believe that the world\u2019s people expect the\nOrganization to take a leading role in resolving their\nmost pressing problems. We believe that the United\nNations can be many things to many people. The\nOrganization has been sorely challenged in recent\nyears, but has shown resolve in rising to the challenge.\nWith an abundance of political will, the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter can triumph.\nThe Government and people of Saint Lucia are inspired\nby that prospect."

        "file_text": "Allow me\nfirst of all to address my warmest congratulations to\nMr. Jean Ping on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Allow me\nalso to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Ping\u2019s\neminent predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, whose great\nvitality enabled him to relaunch the discussion on the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and to give a\nnew impetus towards coordination among the\nOrganization\u2019s main bodies. Finally, I would like to\nexpress to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the\ngreat appreciation of the people and Government of\nBenin for his work as head of our Organization; we\ncommend him for his courage, his skill and his vision\nof world affairs.\nPeople from every corner of the planet are\nplacing great hope in our work over the course of this\nsession to give hope and life to their legitimate\naspirations. That can only be achieved if we all work\n9\n\ntogether, with conviction and determination, to\nconsolidate our commitment to multilateralism.\nYes, in order to survive, our world, more than\never before, needs multilateral cooperation based on\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. Yes, more than ever before the principles of\nthe Charter must be implemented with an acute sense\nof responsibility and a clear understanding of their\npurpose, which is to promote international peace and\nsecurity and economic and social development as\nessential prerequisites for the promotion and protection\nof human dignity.\nYes, it is now on the basis of human dignity that\nwe are to measure the validity and accuracy of any\nnational or international policy. We therefore urge\nevery Member of the United Nations to examine their\nconsciences and to make changes accordingly, so that\nwe can give that approach its fullest meaning. It is on\nthis issue that the challenges are the greatest, as can be\nseen by the blind abuse and violence that is carried out\non a massive scale by terrorists and armed groups\nagainst innocent civilians.\nWith respect to armed conflicts and their\nconsequences, we must redouble our past efforts to\nenhance our ability to act preventively, doing all we\ncan to quickly and effectively defuse potential sources\nof conflicts and neutralize the seeds of conflict\nsituations before they germinate. As we have no other\nchoice but to cure \u2014 since we have been unable to\nprevent \u2014 we have to considerably increase United\nNations capabilities in the areas of peacekeeping and\nmanagement of post-conflict situations.\nWe would like to reiterate our deep gratitude to\nthe Secretary-General for his personal commitment in\nseeking a rapid solution to the Ivorian crisis within the\nframework of the Accra III accords. The international\ncommunity \u2014 despite the erratic evolution of the\nsituation \u2014 must stay the course with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in\nits efforts to respect its commitments and to ensure a\nsmooth transition towards the restoration of peace, by\nstabilizing the situation so that that country can find its\nplace within the development dynamic in the West\nAfrican subregion.\nWe also encourage the international community\nto focus particular attention on the Great Lakes region,\nwhich remains a source of concern. The situation there\nalso requires a regional approach \u2014 one that can be\nbest effected by holding the proposed international\nconference on the Great Lakes region.\nWe reiterate our firm support for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s recommendations to substantially reinforce\nthe troops of the United Nations Organization Mission\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to\nhelp consolidate the peace process in that country.\nThe situation in Darfur has highlighted the urgent\nneed to realize programmes to establish an independent\noperations management unit for peacekeeping within\nthe African Union in order to facilitate the rapid\ndeployment of African forces to stem conflicts as soon\nas they break out.\nConflict prevention can only be effective if we\ntake into consideration the disturbing question of the\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, which is\na dangerous destabilizing factor. The illicit circulation\nof small arms and light weapons considerably reduces\nthe ability of national communities to peacefully\nresolve their disputes.\nThe same applies to disarmament, which Benin\nconsiders crucial to the establishment of peace and the\npromotion of development. We call for the total and\nverifiable elimination from our planet of the threat of\nnuclear arms, as well as other types of weapons of\nmass destruction.\nSince 11 September 2001 international terrorism\nhas become one of the great challenges of our time.\nThe international community must condemn terrorism\nand combat it in all its forms with determination \u2014\nattacking the problem with a renewed political will to\nseek a lasting solution to the serious international\nproblems that terrorism feeds on. We must, however,\nremember that in prosecuting that struggle it is\nimperative that we preserve the democratic freedoms\nthat have been so dearly won by our citizens, and the\nopen society, which is the essence of democracy.\nIndeed, terrorism is not the monopoly of a single\nreligion or nationality, much less that of a given\ncivilization. It is not the concern of one particular\ncategory of countries. It is a global threat and, as a\nresult, requires a global response. My country is\nsparing no effort to join the efforts of the international\ncommunity in that area. It is in that spirit that we\nsigned and carried out the ratification of 12\ninternational conventions regarding the fight against\nterrorism and organized crime.\n10\n\nWe have all acknowledged the need for reform,\nand for more than a decade have been involved in a\nmultidimensional discussion in order to bring the\ninstitutional architecture of the United Nations system\nand its operating methods up to date in accordance\nwith the changing realities the elements of the system\nwere devised to confront.\nThe ultimate goal of reform is to better serve the\nideals of the Organization and better meet the\nlegitimate expectations of the people of the world in\nthe face of the dangers confronting them today.\nWith respect to Security Council reform, most\nMember States have expressed the hope that the\nSecurity Council will become more representative of\nthe international community as a whole, in the light of\nthe considerable increase in the number of Member\nStates \u2014 which have grown from 51 to 192 since the\ncreation of the United Nations \u2014 and in the light of the\nfact that the new States have a certain weight\ndemographically, economically and militarily.\nI take this opportunity to extend my thanks to all\nMember States of the United Nations that, on 23\nOctober 2003, voted for my country, Benin, to become\na non-permanent member of the Security Council for\nthe period 2004-2005.\nIn the context of current discussions on Security\nCouncil reform, Benin believes that any reform of the\nCouncil must take into consideration the legitimate\naspirations of the developing countries, in particular\nAfrican countries, while maintaining the Council\u2019s\neffectiveness and good functioning.\nBenin has no objection to the friendly countries\nof Japan, Germany and Brazil becoming permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. However, the extent,\nthe nature and the modalities of the increase in Council\nmembership should be based on the principles of\nequitable geographic distribution and the sovereign\nequality of States. Clearly, there cannot be a partial or\nselective increase in the number of permanent and non-\npermanent members of the Council that works to the\ndetriment of the developing countries. In that context,\nAfrica, like all regional groups, must have two\npermanent seats on the Security Council. Any other\nsolution would cause a de facto disequilibrium and an\noverrepresentation of one regional group to the\ndetriment of others. In other words, Africa justly\ndemands two permanent seats and two non-permanent\nseats, in addition to the three it currently holds.\nThe right of veto should be extended to the new\npermanent members of the Security Council. In\naddition, the non-permanent members of the Council,\nin rotation, could be accorded the veto power during\nthe month they hold the presidency, given the\nimportance of that position.\nThe link between development and peace can be\nseen more clearly now than in the past. We are used to\nhearing those two concepts linked in the time-honoured\nsaying that \u201cdevelopment is the other name for peace\u201d.\nAs national revenue grows, Governments have greater\nmanoeuvring room to adopt social and economic\npolicies that promote national integration and regional\nequilibrium.\nToday, two years after the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, held at Johannesburg, we all\nagree on the importance of the progressive and\nharmonious attainment of the goals of sustainable\ndevelopment, in accordance with the outcome of our\nwork at Johannesburg. If the environment is important,\nin no way can it be treated separately from other\naspects of sustainable development. Rather, it is by\nreinforcing national development capacity, while\nsupporting the activities of communities through high-\nimpact programmes such as microfinancing, as\nproposed by the United Nations Development\nProgramme and the Global Environment Facility, that\nwe can wage a radical campaign against extreme\npoverty and reduce the number of people living in\npoverty by 2015, as established in the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nThose programmes provide opportunities to help\nus better protect natural resources. However, we will\nnot allow the protection of the environment to become\na limit to our country\u2019s economic growth. Sustainable\ndevelopment, properly understood, consists of\nintegrating all dimensions into a coherent national\npolicy.\nIn developing countries, in particular the least\ndeveloped countries and especially Benin, where many\nefforts have been made to reinforce democracy,\nstrengthen the decentralization process and fight\npoverty, communities and non-governmental\norganizations must be strengthened to decentralize\nmanagement of the environment and thus promote\ndevelopment at the local level.\nAlso to fight poverty and better manage natural\nresources, we must remember that the Johannesburg\n11\n\nSummit identified the United Nations Convention to\nCombat Desertification as one way to fight poverty and\nas a tool available to the international community to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. When, at\nits sixtieth session, the General Assembly examines the\nprogress made towards achieving those Goals, my\ndelegation hopes that the Convention to Combat\nDesertification will take its rightful place in the\ndiscussions on the Millennium Project, led by\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs.\nWith respect to financial resources, we call on the\ninternational community to make the fourth\nreplenishment of the Global Environment Fund even\ngreater than the third and call for the issue of soil\ndegradation and desertification to receive all the\nattention it deserves.\nBy adopting the 2001 Programme of Action for\nthe Least Developed Countries for the decade 2001-\n2010 at the conclusion of the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in\nBrussels, the international community established the\nkey goal of doing everything possible to halve by 2015\nthe number of people living in extreme poverty and\nsuffering hunger and to promote sustainable\ndevelopment in the developing countries.\nIn spite of the efforts made, the least developed\ncountries continue to suffer from the burden of debt,\nleading to weakened measures for social protection, the\nimpoverishment of vulnerable segments of society,\nrural migration and the depreciation of agricultural\nproducts, among other things.\nIn his mandate as Global Chair of the Bureau of\nthe Least Developed Countries, President Mathieu\nK\u00e9r\u00e9kou of the Republic of Benin took part from 28 to\n30 June 2004 in the 2004 high-level segment of the\nEconomic and Social Council\u2019s substantive session,\ndevoted to mobilizing resources and promoting an\nenvironment favourable to eliminating poverty, in the\ncontext of the implementation of the Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the\ndecade 2001-2010. The high-level segment identified\nreal ways to mobilize external and internal resources to\neliminate poverty through microfinancing, the\npromotion of small and medium-sized business and\nland tenure security.\nThe least developed countries, in particular those\nof Africa, must strive to strengthen partnerships with\nthe international community, given that the prospects\nof their national economies raise the most doubts.\nThis year, Benin has again made its modest\ncontribution to international efforts by convening an\nAfrican Union regional conference on the family, in the\nframework of the tenth anniversary of the United\nNations International Year of the Family.\nAt that conference, Africa established an action\nplan on the African family, as well as strategies for its\nimplementation. The action plan is based on the\nobservation that Africa is undergoing three great\ntransformations and is faced with enormous challenges\nthat place increased pressure on families. In order to\nmeet those challenges, we must adopt an integrated\napproach that places families at the centre of a\ncomprehensive development programme to preserve\nthe integrity of families.\nAfrican countries share the conviction that\nimplementation of the nine priority areas of that action\nplan will make it possible to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals in the shortest possible time. The\naction plan has been issued as a United Nations\ndocument. We urge our development partners to give it\nall the necessary attention in order to pool resources to\nimplement the plan, which can be considered a\nsupplementary effort to better focus on human beings\nwithin their basic social milieu and according to their\nprincipal needs, with a view to attaining the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nEncouraging efforts have been made in the areas\nof official development assistance, managing the\nforeign debt of heavily indebted countries and\nmultinational trade negotiations \u2014 in particular those\nundertaken in the context of the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development. They must be coherently\npursued in order to achieve an overall improvement in\nthe foreign environment for developing countries, in\ngeneral, and for African countries, in particular.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nmy appreciation for the extension of the expiration date\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative,\nas well as for the adoption of the general Framework\nfor Establishing Modalities in Agriculture for\nmultilateral trade negotiations under the Doha Work\nProgramme, which is known as the July package. The\ngeneral framework of negotiations on that document\nwas based on the agreement of developed countries to\nbring domestic subsidies for their farmers to a level\n12\n\nthat permits farmers in the least developed countries to\nlive off the fruits of their labours.\nIn that regard, I would like to emphasize that, as\nfar as the sectoral Cotton Initiative is concerned \u2014\nwhich should be the subject of separate and special\ntreatment within a subcommittee \u2014 the development\nstrategy for the cotton sector could encompass\nidentifying market opportunities, the possibility of\ndeveloping high-added-value activities and the\nestablishment of bodies or mechanisms that make it\npossible to regulate and strengthen the market.\nI would like to conclude my statement by\nreminding the Assembly that Benin will assume the\npresidency of the Security Council in February 2005.\nAs part of its presidency, we plan to organize a\nministerial conference in New York on the theme\n\u201cThinking about the future situation of child soldiers in\nAfrica\u201d. One of the objectives envisaged for that\ndebate will be to help find lasting solutions to the\nproblem of child soldiers in Africa and to begin the\nprocess of developing an international legal instrument\nto prevent the recruitment of children into armies.\nThrough that theme, we will hope to engage the\ninternational community in a genuine alliance to\npromote peace, security, political stability and\ndevelopment in Africa. We count on the support and\nparticipation of members of the Assembly in that\nconference, which will make it possible for us to\ndefuse the time bomb represented by the issue of child\nsoldiers. I therefore invite all members to make a\ncontribution in order to bequeath a brighter tomorrow\nto future generations."

        "file_text": "I am delighted to be\nparticipating, for the first time, in the deliberations of\nthe General Assembly as head of State and\nGovernment of the Republic of Malawi.\nI should like to begin by joining others who have\nspoken before me in congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on\nhis assumption of the high office of President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I have no\ndoubt that his election will provide an opportunity to\nincrease global awareness of the enormous challenges\nthat Africa and other less developed regions of the\nworld are facing. I hope that, through him, the\nopportunity for the poor countries to fully participate\nin world economic prosperity will be enhanced.\nI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Julian Robert Hunte,\nfor guiding the work of the fifty-eighth session with\nadmirable skill and pragmatism.\nWe also salute Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, for the dynamic\nleadership skills that he continues to display in steering\nthe affairs of the Organization.\nI have entitled my statement 'Sharing global\nprosperity'. I have done so in order to underscore the\nfact that one of the most daunting challenges facing the\ninternational community today is to achieve a balance\nin economic transformation and growth between the\nrich and the poor countries so as to eradicate poverty\namong the latter.\nIn looking at the future of the United Nations, we\nneed to take stock of the response to world poverty. I\nam aware that several attempts have been made by the\ninternational community to alleviate poverty - and the\ngoal is still being pursued - but the results so far have\nbeen dismal. During the past 30 years, for example, the\nnumber of least developed countries has risen from 25\nto 49. This means that globally, economic growth is in\nreverse gear. Among the questions we are asking with\nregard to the sharing of global prosperity is this: why\n28\n\nare the industrialized countries more prosperous, while\nin Africa and the rest of the developing countries\npoverty is increasing? In other words, why has\nglobalization failed to achieve a more equitable\ndistribution of global prosperity?\nIn Malawi we have discovered that we need to\nseriously transform our economic structures in order to\nbegin to provide and produce new wealth. This can be\nachieved by transforming the abundant agricultural\ncommodities, raw materials and minerals into goods\nthat can be traded globally. It is only by creating new\nwealth in rural areas that we can effectively eradicate\npoverty.\nOur major strategy is to gain a share in global\nprosperity by transforming Malawi from being an\nimporting and consuming country to being a\npredominantly producing and exporting country. In\nother words, we must begin to position our economy to\ntake full advantage of global trade. This will be\nachieved through intensive industrial research and the\napplication of science and technology to the specific\nconditions in my country.\nMalawi - as in the case of most African\ncountries - is richly endowed with a wide range of\nagricultural primary commodities, good soil and water\nresources that can enable us to develop viable agro-\nprocessing and manufacturing industries. The critical\nissue for us in Malawi, therefore, is the creation of new\nwealth as the basis for poverty reduction. In order to do\nthat, we must encourage significant domestic savings,\nas well as inflows of resources, especially foreign\ndirect investment.\nWe in Malawi estimate that in order to alleviate\npoverty, we need to achieve an annual growth rate of at\nleast 6 per cent over the next decade. In order to\nachieve that, we are determined to create conditions for\nsustainable macroeconomic growth through\nfundamental policy reforms to improve economic and\npolitical governance. We have put in place measures\nfor the reform of the public sector, the agricultural\nsector and the private sector.\nWe are also determined to improve good\ngovernance by stamping out corruption. To that end,\nwe have adopted a zero-tolerance stance with regard to\ncorruption. I am therefore happy to have signed,\nyesterday, the United Nations Convention against\nCorruption.\nMalawi is cognizant of the fact that our national\nvision must be fully supported by the international\ncommunity. That is why Malawi joins the call for\nbetter market access and lower tariff and non-tariff\nbarriers to trade in industrialized countries.\nMalawi would therefore like to stress the need to\nadvance the dialogue in the Doha development agenda.\nFor their part, the industrialized nations need to\nseriously address the major concerns of the poor\neconomies. The challenge for industrialized countries\nis therefore to share with the poor countries the\nprosperity that comes about through globalization, by\nassisting us to stand on our own and to develop\nappropriate technologies for transforming our\nagricultural raw materials, minerals and other natural\nresources into wealth. In Malawi, we believe that a\npartner who walks with you side-by-side down the road\nis better than one whom you have to carry on your\nshoulders. We want to walk with the industrialized\nnations; we do not want to be carried on their\nshoulders.\nSome positive efforts that Malawi welcomes\ntowards global equity include the various initiatives\ntaken by the Group of Eight countries aimed at\naddressing some of the concerns to which I have just\nreferred. Among those are the United Kingdom\u00eds\ndecision to significantly increase its aid and technical\nassistance to Africa; the reaffirmation of strong support\nfor the New Partnership for Africa's Development; the\ndecision by the United States Government to extend\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act from 2008 to\n2015; and the European Union's 'Everything But\nArms' initiative, which seeks to enhance opportunities\nfor increased access for African exports into the\nEuropean market.\nThose initiatives are, indeed, encouraging, and\nmy Government fully appreciates them. I wish,\nhowever, to appeal for those noble promises and\ncommitments to be matched by action. We need proof\nthat actions speak louder than words.\nThe management of foreign debt is another\npositive way in which global prosperity can be shared.\nOur concern is that, in spite of numerous initiatives\naimed at finding a durable solution to the debt\nproblem, the world is nowhere near that solution. My\nGovernment is still allocating a significant amount of\nour resources to debt-servicing at the expense of\ninvestment in infrastructure, production and income\n29\n\ngeneration. Such diversion of resources has led, among\nother things, to the deepening of poverty and a lack of\nsignificant macroeconomic growth.\nHowever, Malawi, like other eligible African\ncountries, had welcomed arrangements for debt relief\nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\nDebt Initiative. But the conditions for reaching the\ndecision and completion points are so arduous that\nonly a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have\nmanaged to reach the completion stage. We believe that\nthe preconditions for the HIPC Initiative are\nunrealistic. Surely, less stringent conditionalities would\nhave enabled more countries to succeed.\nThat notwithstanding, Malawi welcomes the\nmeasures by some bilateral donors to respond to the\nexternal debt crisis. In particular, I must mention the\nGovernment of Japan, which, a few weeks ago,\ncancelled a debt Malawi owed it, amounting to $256\nmillion. I take this opportunity to thank Japan most\nsincerely for that gesture. We hope that other\nindustrialized countries will follow this example.\nI referred earlier to the need for adequate donor\nsupport to sustain national initiatives. In that regard, I\nbelieve that the New Partnership for Africa\u00eds\nDevelopment (NEPAD) provides a framework for\nsharing the responsibility for economic development\nbetween Africa and the rich countries. It is for that\nreason that Malawi has acceded to NEPAD\u00eds African\nPeer Review Mechanism in a bid to put in place\ninternationally accepted political and economic good\ngovernance. Our accession to the African Peer Review\nMechanism is also a demonstration of our confidence\nin the NEPAD programme as a tool to enhance Africa\u00eds\neffective participation in global prosperity.\nLet me now turn to a global challenge that\nthreatens all development efforts. This is the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\ncontinues to pound incessantly upon the African\neconomies, destroying the capacity of many countries\nto achieve sustainable economic development. Because\nit affects the most productive segment of our labour\nforce, we are losing more qualified and experienced\npersonnel much faster than we can train new ones.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a human tragedy of\nunimaginable proportions. Experience in dealing with\nthis disaster in my country has taught us that\nHIV/AIDS is a medical crisis, an economic crisis, a\nsocial crisis and a political crisis. It is a medical crisis\nbecause no cure has yet been found for HIV/AIDS. It is\nan economic crisis because it is depleting financial and\nhuman resources for development while also\ndevastating our national capacities for good\ngovernance. HIV/AIDS is a social crisis because of the\nstigma that makes the affected unable to be integrated\ninto normal day-to-day relations as well as in the work\nplaces. HIV/AIDS has also created a large number of\norphans that need to be cared for. HIV/AIDS is a\npolitical crisis because it threatens democratic\ninstitutions by killing politicians and others who are\nthe voice of the people.\nTherefore, in order to deal with this pandemic,\nwe have learned the imperative of adopting a holistic\napproach. It is for that reason that we appeal to the\nUnited Nations to collectively raise new awareness,\nnew assumptions and new solutions. To that end, the\nUnited Nations ought to redesign its policy in\nproviding support, care, treatment and prevention of\nHIV/AIDS, alongside the provision of adequate,\nnutritious food and a proper diet.\nBefore concluding my statement, I wish to raise\nanother concern I have concerning the efforts towards\nsustainable growth and the development of the world.\nThis relates to the need for world peace. One can\nhardly emphasize enough that, without global peace,\nthere cannot be global prosperity. In that regard, I\nwould like to welcome the efforts made by the\nSecretary-General, jointly with the Security Council, in\ntaking a number of decisive steps towards conflict\nprevention, resolution and management around the\nglobe.\nTurning to the specific issues of peace in Africa, I\nam concerned that sub-Saharan Africa has been and\ncontinues to be one of the most unstable and conflict-\nprone regions of the globe. The region also happens to\nbe home to most of the world\u00eds poorest people, who are\nliving below the international poverty line.\nThe conflict in Sudan's Darfur region, in\nparticular, is yet another sad chapter in the history of\nsub-Saharan Africa and one that the African people can\nill afford. Africa and the international community must\nfind quick and lasting solutions to the crisis in the\nDarfur region.\nI would like to conclude my statement by\nassuring the General Assembly that my Government\nfully endorses the proposals to reform the United\nNations. We share the belief that a more representative\n30\n\nand democratic United Nations will enhance the\nefficiency and credibility of this global Organization. It\nwill also enhance the efforts towards a just and more\nequitable sharing of global prosperity.\nMay God bless the United Nations."

        "file_text": "My delegation joins in\nthe many laudatory and congratulatory expressions\naddressed to you, Mr. Ping, as you assume the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth\nsession. Additionally, we pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, whose presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session was virile,\ndynamic and constructive, imbued, as he was, with the\nwisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job and the vision\nof Daniel.\nGrenada\u2019s statement is made from the profound\ndepths of the human heart. The Prime Minister of\nGrenada, The Right Honourable Keith Mitchell, and\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,\nThe Honourable Elvin Nimrod, whose unavoidable\nabsence can be understood, have asked me to speak on\ntheir behalf.\nThe Assembly will, I hope, understand why\nGrenada\u2019s statement in this general debate will focus in\nlarge measure on the natural disaster that has befallen\nthe State of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\nFirst, Grenada expresses grateful appreciation for the\noutpouring of sympathy and assistance from the many\ncountries that have already taken the rostrum \u2014\nespecially from the Caribbean leaders who have seen\nand described to the Assembly, in chilling and heart-\nrending detail, the devastation of the tri-island State of\nGrenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique caused by\njurricane Ivan \u201cthe Terrible\u201d.\nTherefore, there is no need for me to multiply my\nwords except to say that the fickle finger of fate\nseemed to have conspired with nature \u2014 exceedingly\nbenevolent at times, but sometimes equally destructive.\nThis time, it released its full fury on a vulnerable small\nisland developing State, reducing it to rubble. After\nhurricane Ivan\u2019s rage had subsided, there was complete\ndestruction of the infrastructure, and it seemed as if a\nStygian darkness had descended on the land. However,\nthe resilience of our people and the emerging solidarity\ngive us hope that, with the assistance of the\ninternational community, Grenada \u2014 like the\nmythological phoenix \u2014 will rise from the ashes\nbrought about by the hurricane.\nWho can help us pick up the pieces of a shattered\ncountry with a dislocated economy, whose precipitous\ndecline has brought it to rock bottom? An assessment\nof the destruction reveals that it would take $2 billion\nto rebuild the State of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite\nMartinique. That is a Herculean task far beyond our\nmeans. The call, therefore, is made to the international\ncommunity: \u201cCome down to Macedonia and help us\u201d.\nWe plead with the United Nations, its agencies the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, UNICEF,\nUNESCO, the World Bank, the International Monetary\nFund, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations, the World Health Organization,\nindividual countries, individual permanent\nrepresentatives, non-governmental organizations and\nfriends to help Grenada help itself.\nIn that connection, my delegation recalls the\nwords of the seventeenth-century English clergyman\nand poet John Donne: \u201cNo man is an island, entire of\nitself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of\nthe main.\u201d Thus, what happens to each of us affects all\nof us. Today, that is eminently borne out by the\ninterconnectivity and interdependence of societies,\naided by the information and communication\ntechnology revolution. Consequently, we speak today\nabout a world shared by all instead of a world divided.\nGiving, caring and sharing should therefore be a\nreality, not just a concept.\nForgiving Grenada\u2019s debt and cancelling its\nobligations to international organizations and\ninstitutions will give Grenada a breathing spell. Help in\n17\n\nthat regard will be formally requested through official\nchannels and will free Grenada of its many obligations.\nThe dire problems of my country\nnotwithstanding, we cannot fail to touch upon the\nworld situation, in which the geopolitical centre of\ngravity continues to swing from the Israeli-Palestinian\nstruggle to Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation in those\ncentres of conflict is fanned further by the heinous and\natrocious crime of terrorism, which is fast becoming a\nway of life. In that regard, my delegation recalls an\nancient law: hatreds never cease by hatreds; it is by\nlove alone that they cease.\nIt will be recalled that, from this rostrum, I told\nmy colleagues that I would demit office at the end of\nthis month, having attained the ripe old age of 84 years\nand having served my country in this honourable body\nfor almost 13 years. Today, I want to recant with regard\nto that diplomatic note on my premature departure and\nto tell the Assembly that my Government has asked me\nto continue. Therefore, refreshed in body and mind,\nconfident in faith and joyful in hope, I will continue to\nexpect the generous assistance of my colleagues.\nWith respect to my age, I should like to quote Sir\nFrancis Bacon, who wrote several centuries ago that\nage appears to be best in four things: old wood best to\nburn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust and old\nauthors to read. Colleagues, I treasure your friendship\nand ask for your support on behalf of my country.\nLet me conclude with this patriotic verse:\nTo all the world I give my hand,\nMy heart I give my native land;\nI seek her good, her glory.\nI honour every nation\u2019s name,\nRespect their fortune and their fame;\nBut I love the land that bore me!\nLove the land that bore me!\nPlease allow me an addendum to my statement. I\nwish to announce that tomorrow, Friday, at 10.30 a.m.\nin the Economic and Social Council Chamber, the\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nand the United Nations Development Programme will\nmake a flash appeal for assistance to Grenada and\nHaiti."

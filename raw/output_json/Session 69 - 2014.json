        "file_text": "The lofty aspirations of the Millennium Development Goals \nguided our first steps into the era of the second \nmillennium and enabled us to realize, in part, the \npriorities that we hold so dear. With this shared \nexperience, which is extraordinary in terms of what it \nhas made concrete, and aware of the new challenges \nthat have been imposed on us over the past 15 years, \nwe now have clear lessons on which to build the future \nwe want. We now know that peace and development are \ninseparable.\n\nThe future to which we all aspire can be understood \non three levels, based on the three pillars of sustainable \ndevelopment that command our attention equally. The \nwork we have started on defining the post-2015 era, \nby its very nature and given the challenges it poses, \nmerits committed efforts by the entire international \ncommunity, which have already been undertaken. \nIndeed, it requires a contribution by all States and all \nparts of society, including the private sector, academia, \nphilanthropy and, obviously, non-governmental \norganizations. It also must be, as a matter of ethics but \nalso to ensure its viability, inclusive, participatory and \nbased on good governance.\n\nThose are therefore the bases for defining the post-\n2015 era, despite the glaring paradoxes and the many \nobstacles we unfortunately face. At a time when the \nworld is highly interdependent, its communications \ntechnology performing as never before and its riches \nabundant, inequalities continue to grow, and too many \nof us remain marginalized and live in unacceptable \nconditions.\n\nInevitable climate change, which is recognized as \nthe greatest challenge of our time, will decide the fate of \nour planet and darkens our future prospects by already \nthreatening our present. Conflicts persist, while others \nare born, and terrorist acts lead to a range of problems \nthat challenge traditional defence strategies. This past \nyear, existing and new conflicts have escalated towards \nan unacceptable level. The Monegasque authorities can \nonly reiterate their commitment to the values of the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations and join the efforts of those who seek a peaceful \nand political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria and the assault \non civilian targets in Syria, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, South \nSudan, Mali, the Central African Republic and Nigeria \nhave spread horror and are barbarous practices. They \nare intolerable. That is why the Government of Monaco \ncondemned acts of abject violence by supporting the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) last \nweek, which establishes a new legislative and policy \nframework to coordinate international efforts to fight \nagainst the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters.\n\nThe Principality shares the grief of the French, \nBritish and American peoples following the heinous \nkillings of their nationals who were held hostage. In \nmemory of those victims, His Serene Highness Prince \nAlbert II asked that flags at administrative buildings and \nMonegasque public institutions be flown at half-mast. \nThose who commit such heinous crimes in the name \nof a religion they blaspheme annihilate the foundation \nof our society by violating the rule of law and respect \nfor the standards that we have developed together. They \nuse communications networks and social networks, \nwhich we might think would be used to spread harmony \nand unity, to spread hatred and chaos. We have reason \nto wonder about their motivations and the reasons that \nmake their appeal so convincing.\n\nThe response is obviously rooted in exclusion and \nthe marginalization of people who have not yet benefited \nfrom what we call progress. It often involves young \npeople without prospects for the future. Therefore, \nit is our responsibility to design inclusive social \nintegration policies, promoting education and youth \nemployment. Young people have never formed such a \nlarge proportion of the world population \u2014 particularly \nin developing countries. They must be an integral part \n\nof the decision-making process in order to allow them \nto realize their human potential.\n\nWe welcome, in that respect, the \u201cRights Up \nFront\u201d initiative of the Secretary-General, launched in \nNovember 2013, whose primary objective is to make \nsure that human rights violations do not become mass \ncrimes and to enable the Organization to act more \nquickly by placing people at the heart of its strategies \nand operational activities.\n\nOn the eve of the tenth anniversary of the 2005 \nSummit, and especially as memories of sinister \ngenocides come to mind, we must do a better job of \npromoting the responsibility to protect. That is the \nprimary responsibility of every State, as we know, but \nwe also need to be able to help States for which capacity-\nbuilding is difficult. Prevention remains a fundamental \naspect of our Organization\u2019s work. In that regard, the \ninvolvement of regional and subregional organizations \nis essential to the effective implementation of the \nprotection of populations from genocide, war crimes \nand crimes against humanity. The promotion and \nprotection of human rights must be at the heart of our \npolicies. Prince Al-Hussein has our full confidence. \nWith his experience and his unwavering commitment \nto peace and the rule of law, he can be the right United \nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights for our \ntimes.\n\nAnother aspect also deserves emphasis \u2014 the \ndelivery of humanitarian assistance in conflict zones. \nIt must not depend on the political context. The \npoliticization of humanitarian assistance should be \na priority item for discussion at the global summit in \n2016.\n\nIn the light of the increasing number and persistence \nof crisis areas, caused both by conflicts and by natural \ndisasters, whose frequency we now associate with the \nrate of climate change, we must take into consideration \nthe needs of over 50 million people. The magnitude of \nthose needs justifies the new partnerships that have \nbeen formed around organizations, local partners and \nthe private sector and individuals.\n\nThe unprecedented threat of the Ebola virus in West \nAfrica is testing our ability to respond in an effective \nand coordinated manner. We support the establishment \nby the Secretary-General of the United Nations \nMission for Ebola Emergency Response to counter the \nlarge-scale threat Ebola poses to international peace \nand security. In that regard, I wish to acknowledge the \ncommitment of the Principality of Monaco, which is \neffectively contributing to that unprecedented struggle, \ntogether with the World Health Organization and the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. We share in \nthe grief of the victims and that of their families. We \nare aware that the families\u2019 tragedies are compounded \nand their pain is made unbearable by the fact that they \nare unable to take care of their loved ones or provide \nproper funerals for those who die.\n\nIn these difficult times, we need to establish a new \npost-2015 sustainable development paradigm. Universal, \ninclusive, ambitious and concrete, it must accommodate \nthe pressures of a growing global population and the \nurbanization that comes with it. It requires us to adapt \nour methods of production, consumption and transport \nand to opt for clean technologies. We need to define the \nnature of the world we want to live in, with and for our \nchildren. As I mentioned earlier, it is vital that the needs \nof the most vulnerable be duly taken into consideration \nand that economic independence for women and young \npeople be ensured. It is time for women to realize the \ntransformation that the Secretary-General announced \nby breaking through the glass ceiling that for too long \nhas kept them from achieving their potential. Without \nthe full contribution of those who constitute 50 per cent \nof humankind, sustainable development will not be \nachieved.\n\nThe year 2015 will also mark the fifteenth \nanniversary of the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security. \nWe reiterate our call to end impunity for crimes related \nto sexual and gender-based violence against women, as \nwell as all the abuse women suffer.\n\nThe undeniable success of the Climate Summit should \nbe measured not only by the commitments announced, \nbut also by the broad participation of the private sector, \nfoundations and civil society and by the sense of \nownership expressed by all the stakeholders concerned. \nThe Summit therefore succeeded in catalysing society \nas a whole, thus ensuring that the political momentum \nwill be maintained in Lima and Paris. As the issue of \nclimate change cannot be separated from the question \nof the oceans, the Prince\u2019s Government will continue \nto defend an objective of sustainable development \ndedicated to healthy and productive oceans for all. The \nAssembly may rest assured that Monaco will engage in \ndiscussions, which will begin in January, and we will \ncontinue, in both national and international policies, to \nact as a responsible and unifying partner.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it gives me great \npleasure to congratulate you warmly, Mr. President, \nand, through you, your friendly country Uganda upon \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-ninth session. I take this opportunity to wish \nyou luck and success in the noble mission entrusted to \nyou, and I affirm the Kingdom of Bahrain\u2019s support \nfor your judicious proposal regarding the formulation \nand adoption of a post-2015 development agenda that \nwill build on past achievements in the context of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for the well-\nbeing of all people.\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to commend your \npredecessor, Ambassador John Ashe, for his excellent \nconduct of the work of the Assembly during its sixty-\neighth session and his outstanding and successful \nefforts.\n\nWe also greatly appreciate the efforts of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to revitalize and strengthen the \nOrganization\u2019s role and to realize its objectives in all \nfields. I commend the report he introduced earlier in the \ncurrent session on the work of the Organization (A/69/1). \nIt demonstrates the daunting responsibility assumed by \nour Organization in creating an environment conducive \nto seeking appropriate solutions to the problems and \nchallenges that we all face.\n\nThe inaugural statement by the Secretary-General \nat the opening of the general debate (see A/69/PV.6) shed \nlight on a number of the challenges facing us, including \nclimate change, the spread of diseases, particularly the \nEbola epidemic in West Africa, the aggravated refugee \nproblem, the propagation of extremism, policies \nof exclusion, violence, violations of human rights, \nparticularly those affecting women, and issues related \nto health, education and food security.\n\nMy country supports the Secretary-General\u2019s \nurgent call to conclude a global climate agreement at the \nforthcoming Lima and Paris conferences and stresses \nthe importance of the Green Climate Fund, designed to \nmitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nIt is a matter of particular pride for me to mention \nthe vigorous efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of \nBahrain and the resulting successes in countering \nthe numerous challenges and instability currently \nfacing the region. As classified by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) 2014 Human \nDevelopment Report \u2014 which is based on objective \nstatistical criteria regarding, first and foremost, health \ncare, education, per capita income and the equality of \nwomen \u2014 the Kingdom of Bahrain is ranked among the \ncountries with \u201cvery high human development\u201d. That is \na status achieved through persistent hard work, and we \nwill endeavour to maintain it.\n\nThose goals, however, have never been an end in \nthemselves. The principal objective is to achieve the \nwell-being of Bahraini citizens and to protect all those \nwho live within the borders of the Kingdom, an oasis of \nsecurity and calm enjoyed equally by all.\n\nI am pleased to recall in that context the award \nbestowed on His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa \nby the Foundation for Coexistence among Religions in \nrecognition of His Majesty\u2019s outstanding contributions \nin the field of dialogue among civilizations and \ncultures. I also note that the fourteenth Conference on \nAll Civilizations in the Service of Humanity was held in \nManama in early May under the high-level patronage of \nHis Majesty the King and with the participation of the \nUnited Nations and a distinguished group of thinkers, \nscholars and opinion-makers. The Conference adopted \nthe Bahrain Declaration, which has been circulated and \ndeposited as an official document of the United Nations \n(A/68/959, annex).\n\nAdditionally, I would like to mention His Majesty\u2019s \ninitiative to establish an Arab human rights tribunal. \nThe initiative has been approved by all States members \nof the League of Arab States, and the statute has been \nadopted. I would also like to mention the launch in \nBahrain in November 2013 of the UNDP report Water \nGovernance in the Arab Region, which calls for the \nadoption of a joint Arab water-management strategy.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to play an \nenergetic role in the United Nations system, where it \nseeks to further progress through gradual and steady \nreform and modernization along the lines envisaged by \nHis Majesty the King. Such reform would be based on a \nstrategy of common denominators, continuous and open \ndialogue and a national exchange of views \u2014 the same \nstrategy as led to the early achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Accordingly, the strategies and \npreparations for the post-2015 development agenda are \nalso based on tireless work, determination, persistence, \ngood faith and comprehensive planning and are aimed \nat promoting continual and enhanced progress and \nserving the interests of the Kingdom\u2019s citizens and \nresidents alike.\n\nOur region is going through a phase of extreme \ndifficulty \u2014 probably the most difficult in its modern \nhistory \u2014 in which a climate of instability, chaos, \ntension and savage, bloody and unprecedented terrorism \nprevails. Of the many contributing factors, the most \nsalient are the following.\n\nFirst, the accelerated emergence of terrorist groups \nof various global dimensions and affiliations. They \nthrive in our region, exhibiting the greatest savagery \nand callousness. Not only do they target innocent \npeople in general, they also engage in such inhumane \npractices as mass murder, public beheadings and the \npersecution of ethnic and religious minorities, which \nthey displace, destroying their cultural heritage, \ndepriving them of religious freedom and causing them \nto flee their homes. They attack entire cities and declare \nwar on sovereign countries in regional and international \nsettings, in complete disregard of all religious doctrines \nand the intrinsic human values \u2014 tolerance, equality, \nmoderation and respect for cultural diversity \u2014 that \nhave enabled human civilizations, including our Arab \nand Islamic civilization, to coexist. These terrorist \ngroups \u2014 they include Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in \nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Hizbullah, and their \nextensions and counterparts \u2014 recruit their fighters \nfrom both East and West and perpetrate horrific terrorist \nacts. The young and the old alike are killed, women are \ntaken as war bounty, families are displaced and privacy \nis violated, the objective being to undermine security, \npropagate anarchy and topple regimes.\n\nTherefore, combating terrorist groups requires \nus to work together in three main areas. The first of \nthese is the security and military area, owing to the \nworsening threat posed by these terrorist groups as they \nacquire heavy weapons, enabling them to occupy cities \nfor use as safe havens and bases from which to launch \nthe terrorist operations that disrupt the stability and \nsecurity of our region.\n\nWe share a common responsibility with friendly \ncountries and our allies is to eradicate the terrorist group \nof ISIL. To that end, our air force, in collaboration with \nthese countries, has targeted a number of ISIL positions. \nWe welcome Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), \nadopted on 24 September, which focuses on stopping \nthe recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters. Also, we \ncontinue to closely monitor borders and exit and entry \npoints so as to stop citizens of the Kingdom from \ncontacting or joining terrorist groups and to arrest and \nprosecute all those who have allegedly been affiliated \nto them as soon as they return to the country.\n\nSecondly, we must combat all ideology that runs \ncounter to human nature and betrays true Islam by \ndistorting its precepts. Muslim clerics and scholars can \nplay an important part in counteracting such distortion. \nWe therefore call on all Muslim scholars to expose and \ndisown ideas that are not related to Islam in any way, \nand we appreciate their playing a leading role in that \nrespect. It is imperative to stand together in the face of \nthe ideas propagated by the terrorist groups.\n\nThirdly, we must deal with financing, as it \nconstitutes the lifeline of the terrorist groups, enabling \nthem to perpetrate their barbaric acts, purchase \nweapons and influence some young people. In that \nconnection, the Kingdom of Bahrain will convene \na high-level international conference during the \nfirst week of November to consider the financing of \nterrorism, how best to combat such financing and how \nto deprive terrorism of its sources of finance. We firmly \nbelieve that preventing the financing of terrorism will \nsignificantly contribute to overcoming terrorism and to \neradicating it.\n\nThe second challenge to the security and stability of \nour region is that of political expansionism and attempts \nto impose hegemony, in disregard of the sovereignty \nof States, and to interfere in their internal affairs. All \nthe countries of the region, without exception, have \nsuffered from such issues as a result of attempts to \nexport seditious revolutions and to train terrorists \nin violation of international law and the principles \nof the United Nations. Such attempts represent an \nideology that is archaic in its political dimension and \nin its defiance of the values and principles enshrined in \nnumerous international instruments.\n\nOne form of such interference is the exploitation of \nthe media, in particular satellite television channels and \nsocial media, which are misused in order to distort facts \nand to cause instability in the region. We condemn such \nillegal and illegitimate practices, which contravene \ninternational values and principles.\n\nI would like to point out what the Republic of \nYemen endures. With each step that it takes forward, \nterrorist groups rush to pursue their criminal objectives \nby undermining its stability and security. The Kingdom \nof Bahrain reaffirms its support for President Abdrabuh \nMansour Hadi Mansour and his tireless efforts to \nstrengthen the national consensus achieved through a \n\n\ncomprehensive national dialogue on the basis of the \nGulf Cooperation Council initiative and the relevant \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n\nTurning to Iraq, which has suffered from flagrant \ninterference, insecurity, hegemony and anarchy, we see \nsome hope in the positive developments in the country. \nWe are pleased to welcome the election of President Fuad \nMasum and the establishment of the new Government \nunder Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We hope \nthat such a development will enhance the political \nand development processes, thereby contributing to \nthe consolidation of Iraq\u2019s security and stability, the \npreservation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity \nand the strengthening of its links with its fellow Arabs \nin the region where it naturally belongs.\n\nThe conflict in Syria becomes more complex and \nmore acute every year. Innocent civilians are paying \nthe ultimate price and losing their lives, property and \ndignity. The humanitarian situation deteriorates daily \nin the absence of a comprehensive political solution to \nsafeguard the lives of the Syrian people and to extricate \nthat beloved country from its protracted suffering \nthrough a comprehensive political process aimed at \nachieving reform and political plurality. With regard to \nthe humanitarian aspect, we reiterate that it is necessary \nto overcome all impediments to the delivery of \nhumanitarian assistance to those in need, in accordance \nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\nIn that respect, I wish to express my country\u2019s \ngreat appreciation for the humanity shown by the \nsisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in hosting \nand delivering assistance to Syrian refugees. We also \nappreciate the humanitarian role played by Turkey and \nLebanon, as well as by the Office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nWith regard to the Arab Republic of Egypt, \nthe Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the democratic \ndevelopment that has taken place in that country \nand the implementation of the road map through the \nestablishment of a Constitution that reflects the will of \nthe Egyptian people. We also welcome the presidential \nelections and the ongoing preparations for the holding \nof legislative elections so as to complete the State \ninstitutions under the Constitution.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its complete \ncondemnation of any interference in the internal affairs \nof Egypt. We support the efforts of President Abdel \nFattah Al Sisi and the steps that he has taken to combat \nterrorism, to preserve the security and stability of \nEgypt and to pursue its strategic and active role at the \nArab, regional and international levels. In that regard, \nI would like to commend the initiative taken by the \nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \nBin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia, in announcing the convening of an Egyptian \neconomic summit in support of Egypt and its economic \ndevelopment.\n\nWe reiterate the historical, principled and constant \nposition of the Kingdom of Bahrain in solidarity with \nthe Kingdom of Morocco and our full support for its \ninitiatives with regard to self-government for the \nMoroccan Sahara within Moroccan sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity, in accordance with international \nlegitimacy.\n\nWith regard to Libya, the Kingdom of Bahrain \nwishes to express its grave concern about the \ndeteriorating security situation as a result of the \nviolent acts perpetrated by terrorist groups and \nthe repercussions of such acts on the stability of \nneighbouring countries. The Kingdom of Bahrain \nsupports the legitimate constitutional institutions \nrepresented by the elected House of Representatives \nand welcomes the establishment of the new Government \nunder Mr. Abdallah Al-Thani. We hope that such a \ndevelopment will help to establish security and stability \nand to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of that \nsisterly country.\n\nIn view of our keen interest in striving to achieve \nour principal goal, namely, to protect humankind \nfrom the scourge of war, conflict and disaster and to \ncondemn attempts at hegemony and destabilization, we \nreiterate our call to make the Middle East, including \nthe Arab Gulf region, a zone free of weapons of mass \ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons. On the basis \nof that principle, we support the efforts of the P5+1 \nto promptly find a solution to the issue of the Iranian \nnuclear programme, in accordance with the provisions \nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons and the Convention on Nuclear Safety, without \nprejudice to the use of nuclear technology for peaceful \npurposes. Such use is a natural right of all States under \nthe international safeguards system.\n\nThe third and last challenge is the illegal occupation \nof the territory of other States in breach of the principles \nof international law and the Charter of the United \nNations, as demonstrated by Israel\u2019s violation of all \n\n\ninternational laws, agreements and decisions and its \ntargeting of the Palestinian people by confiscating their \nland, by building or expanding settlements thereon and \nby imposing blockades on them. Such violations found \ntheir ugliest expression in the most recent criminal \naggression against the Gaza Strip, which resulted in \ntremendous damage and caused the death of more than \n2,000 martyrs, the displacement of a great number of \nPalestinians and the destruction of infrastructure.\n\nI would like to recall the words of \nPresident Mahmoud Abbas in his statement before \nthe General Assembly, his request that international \nprotection be provided to the Palestinian people and \ntheir territories under occupation and his demand that \nIsrael abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 \n(see A/69/PV.12). It is imperative to have a specific \ntime frame for an end to the Israeli occupation and to \nachieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the \nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on \nall its territory within the boundaries of 4 June 1967, \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, as stipulated under \nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution, \nin accordance with international legitimacy and the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\n\nIn that context, we commend the pivotal role \nplayed by the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to \nreach a ceasefire in Gaza. We greatly appreciate its \nhosting, in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway, \nan international conference in support of Palestine and \nthe reconstruction of the Gaza Strip next month. We \nalso commend the important role of the United Nations \nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \nNear East.\n\nWith regard to the occupation by the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran of the three islands Greater Tunb, \nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which belong to the United \nArab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its \nconsistent position condemning that occupation. We \ncall on Iran to heed the efforts of the United Arab \nEmirates to resolve the issue through direct negotiations \nor through the arbitration of the International Court of \nJustice.\n\nThose are the key challenges facing our region. \nIf we overcome them, it will be relatively easy for us, \nwithin our common responsibilities, to address the \ninternational challenges that the Secretary-General \ndescribed in his statement, to which I referred at the \nbeginning of my statement. If we focus on those very \nserious issues, we will be on the right path towards true \nsustainable development and the necessary reform to \nmeet the aspirations of all peoples.\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges that we all face, the \nKingdom of Bahrain will always remain committed to \nmoving forward on the path of development, reform and \npositive interaction with the international community \nin order to achieve our aspirations and objectives. In \nthat respect, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in line with its \nfirm approach towards reform under the leadership \nof His Majesty the King, will continue to work for \nthe upholding of the rule of law, pluralism and active \npolitical participation. We look forward to the elections \nto be held on 22 November, so as to consolidate all our \nachievements.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore the \nfact that in the Kingdom of Bahrain our choices are \nclear. Our vision is comprehensive and our strategy \ncomplementary to and in line with our Gulf, Arab and \ninternational contexts. The Kingdom always seeks to \npromote stability, peace, security, development and the \nprotection of human rights. It rejects and condemns \nterrorism, violence and hatred and works for a society \nin which harmony and consensus prevail for the benefit \nof all and for the establishment of a promising future \nfull of opportunity and achievement for all future \ngenerations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour \nfor me to represent my country, the Principality of \nAndorra, in the Assembly, which for almost seven \ndecades has been meeting annually to speak of peace, \ndevelopment and justice, and particularly this year, \nin which we are marking two historic events that are \nclosely linked to the birth of the United Nations.\n\nThe year 2014 will mark 100 years since the \nbeginning of the First World War and 70 years since \nthe landing of the Allies in Normandy, which was the \nbeginning of the end of the Second World War. Those \ntwo armed conflicts caused humanity to open its eyes \nto a new reality: the old balances among European \nPowers no longer served to maintain peace in the \nworld. The policy of blocs was ineffectual in preventing \nconflicts with enormous destructive capacity. Further, \nthe foreign activities of countries, focusing solely and \nexclusively on their national interests, proved in some \ncases to be the cause of the conflicts.\n\nThe two World Wars raised humankind\u2019s awareness \nin that the world needed a global order that would \nensure peace and security and promote development \nand justice. Those functions could no longer be \nprovided by a single country, however powerful and \nlarge, or even by a bloc of countries; rather, there had \nto be multilateral action. That was the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of \nthe United Nations, of which the highest expression is \nthis General Assembly.\n\nI wanted to begin with a brief historical reference, \nbecause I believe that the challenges of peace and \nsecurity in the world of today are not very different \nfrom the challenges of peace and security of the world \nof yesterday, of 1914 or 1944. Certainly there is a \nvariety of challenges, but they have a very significant \ncommon denominator: they can be resolved only with a \nvision that is global, multilateral, effective and, above \nall, respectful of the principles that inspire this General \nAssembly.\n\nThe conflicts in Syria, Palestine or Ukraine, which \nthreaten peace and security and stability, will not be \n\nresolved optimally or effectively with a partial or short-\nterm vision. Any solution that veers away from the \nfounding principles of the United Nations is condemned \nto be unstable, not lasting and, unfortunately, quite \noften a solution that leads to new conflicts.\n\nTherefore Andorra has always championed and will \ncontinue to champion the discussion of and solutions \nto those conflicts under United Nations auspices. We \ndid so when we co-sponsored the draft resolution in \nthe Security Council that would have requested that the \ncase of Syria be referred to the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC), because without justice there can be no \nlasting peace \u2014 neither in Syria nor anywhere else.\n\n\nAlso, in the same spirit we have been unflagging \nin our defence of a solution to the Palestinian conflict \nthat obtains peaceful coexistence for two States, in \ncompliance with United Nations resolutions. A solution \nmust be based on mutual recognition and mutual respect, \nbecause the aspirations of the Palestinian people to have \ntheir own State are noble and respectable, but also noble \nand respectable are the aspirations of the Government of \nIsrael to ensure life and security for its citizens. Along \nthe same lines, we do not believe that any solution to \nthe Ukrainian conflict can be stable unless it respects \nthe principles of international law and unless it comes \nas the fruit of a sincere dialogue \u2014 neither in Ukraine \nnor anywhere else.\n\nThe risk and threat to international peace and \nsecurity arising from the emergence of the Islamic \nState in Syria and Iraq require a clear response from \nthe international community vis-\u00e0-vis the extremists. \nThere can be no excuse or mitigating factor for the \ncriminal acts of barbarism, sectarianism and \u2014 let us \nbe clear \u2014 terrorism to which the Islamic State resorts \nas a strategy for its action and communication. There \ncan be no double-standard discourse. The Islamic State \nmurders innocent people in cold blood. We all feel as \nif we are British, American or French citizens when \nwatching the recent savage executions. We must also \nall feel as if we were Syrian or Iraqi citizens \u2014 true \nvictims of those extremists, though not always so \nvisible in the media. There can be no room for inaction \nor for impunity.\n\nNew threats, also global in nature, have appeared, \nsuch as the phenomenon of foreign combatants. In \nthat connection, Andorra co-sponsored the recent \nSecurity Council resolution 2178 (2014). We must have \na response to rechannel efforts to tackle the challenges \nand immediate threats. In the long run we must be able \nto persevere in the fight against sectarian discourse, \nextremist discourse, and discourses of hate. On that \npoint, education must play an essential role, together \nwith the other values of the United Nations, now and \nin the future.\n\nThe actions taken by my country in the United \nNations over the past year have focused primarily on \neducation. That matter requires, perhaps more than \nany other, a vision that integrates long-term thinking. \nPromoting access to quality education for all the \ncitizens of our planet has always been a priority of the \nUnited Nations, because when we speak of education \nwe are speaking also of fundamental rights and of \ndevelopment. But I would go further. Education is \nalso an instrument for creating awareness of a global \ncitizenry. If there is not a broad majority of citizens of \nthe world who believe in the principles and values of \nthe United Nations, our actions will always be in vain.\n\nI am convinced that the only way to create global \nawareness is through education. Education is the best \nweapon in the fight against hatred and violence of all \nkinds. Andorra therefore welcomes and has participated \nfrom the beginning in the Global Education First \nInitiative promoted by the Secretary-General, because \nit brings a universal vision together with local action. \nIt also shows that diversity is strengthened in a global \nfocus, and with diversity we can strengthen democracy.\n\nAndorrans, because of our historical and \ngeographical circumstances, have understood for some \ntime that education must have a twofold focus, local and \nglobal. We have also long understood that cooperation \namong the different States strengthens the quality of \nour educational systems and opens new opportunities \nfor our citizens. I say \u201ceducational systems\u201d because \nthe citizens of Andorra can have access on an equal \nfooting, and without cost, to French, Spanish and \nAndorran education. Those three public education \nsystems are complemented by the offer in Andorra of a \nCatholic religious education, accessible also to a great \npart of our population.\n\nPerhaps without being fully aware of it, or perhaps \nbecause fortune has placed us between two great \nEuropean nations, it is true that for decades now we \nAndorrans have educated ourselves in diversity and \nin being multicultural. That has not caused us to lose \n\nour identity; on the contrary, our identity has been \nreinforced. Sometimes we are not even aware ourselves \nof the educational richness of our country and of the \ngreat asset that that is. For that reason the Government \nof Andorra has focused a great deal of its policy and \naction abroad on education. In 2012 and 2013, during \nthe Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe, that \nis how we acted. It is also what we have shown through \nparticipating in the Global Education First Initiative, \ntogether with 15 other countries from all continents. \nThat was an honour for Andorra.\n\nThat activity abroad is also reflected coherently \nin internal policies in Andorra. We have suffered the \neffects of the international economic crisis for years. We \nhave had austerity in our public spending, but that has \nnot undermined our educational system. It will never \naffect our educational system, or undermine it, because \neducation is the best passport to the opportunity for a \nfuture that is better for all.\n\nThe need for multilateral action is clear not only \nin the matter of education but also, and perhaps even \nmore intensely, in the fight against global warming. \nWhat we each can do unilaterally will not accomplish \nmuch if there is no global commitment. It is in the fight \nagainst climate change that we can see most clearly that \nunilateral actions have a limited reach. Andorrans are \nvery aware of that, given that our primary economic \nsector is winter and mountain tourism \u2014 a tourism \nthreatened by global warming. The Pyrenees are \nheating up at 0.2\u00b0C each decade, and precipitation has \ndropped by 2 litres per square metre each year.\n\nIt is clear that a programme of local action is \nrequired. We are working, together with the population \nthrough education and awareness, on policies to reduce \nour impact on the environment. We are preparing \nstudies to seek ways to mitigate the effects of climate \nchange and also to seek alternative and complementary \nsystems. Over the years ahead, we will deploy great \nefforts to bring about alternative energy sources.\n\nBut all that is not enough, nor are the many \nactions being implemented by Governments in \ncountries represented enough. National domestic \nenvironmental policies are important, but if we are to \nlimit carbon dioxide emissions we must have a global \ncommitment. Without effective implementation of such \na commitment, the fight against climate change will not \nbear the hoped-for fruits. We have a year to prepare for \nthe Paris Conference, a year to mobilize our efforts.\n\nIt is also time for the international community \nto mobilize to fight the Ebola virus that so seriously \naffects Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. It also affects \nus; let us not deceive ourselves. It is the time to show \nsolidarity, to help. Now is the time, in the weeks and \nmonths ahead, when we must tackle that disease, \nwhich, unfortunately, does not recognize \u2014 nor will it \nrecognize \u2014 borders. It is urgent. Beyond that it is, in \nmy opinion, a global emergency.\n\nThree years ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs \nof the Principality of Andorra came to this Assembly \nand spoke, among other things, of an ambitious reform \nprogramme for restructuring our economic model (see \nA/66/PV.27). The programme hinged on transparency, \neconomic openness and a homogenization that would \nrespect certain Andorran specifics. Today, three \nyears down the road, we can make a very satisfactory \nassessment of the implementation of that policy. Our \ncountry has implemented a fiscal model that works \nwith our European neighbours, a moderate system that \ntaxes all income and promotes economic productivity.\n\nWe have also opened 100 per cent of the Andorran \neconomy to foreign investment, as we believe that a \nmore open world is a more transparent world, one with \nmore opportunities for all, and in particular for those \nwho deserve it the most. A country such as ours, which \nfor many years has been open to immigration, cannot \ncontinue to allow our citizens to have different levels \nof rights economically. They must all have the same \neconomic rights. In that process we have broadened all \neconomic rights to all foreign residents, who represent \nmore than half of our population, because a more open \neconomy is also a fairer and more democratic society.\n\nAt the same time, along with its domestic reforms, \nAndorra has negotiated double-taxation agreements \nwith France and Luxembourg and is negotiating one \nwith Spain that I am convinced will be concluded soon. \nWe think we can have a similar agreement with other \nEuropean and other countries. Those agreements show \nthat there is a commitment in Andorra to a more open and \ntransparent global economy. That is a firm commitment \non the part of our Government with regard to generating \nmore opportunities for our business sector. We are also \nfirmly determined to move towards greater integration \nof our economy in the single European market. For us, \ngoing global begins in Europe.\n\nI wanted to sum up some of our principal \ndomestic reforms because I understand that a spirit \n\nof multilateralism and a global spirit must prevail. \nThe efforts of a country working for transparency and \neconomic cooperation make sense and will be effective \nonly if they are accompanied by equal efforts by all \ncountries \u2014 again, by all countries. Andorrans are \ncommitted to moving in that direction, and to do so \ntogether with the international community, because we \nknow that it is only thus, only by working globally, that \nprogress will be effective, equitable and stable.\n\nThe statement of the Head of Government of a \ncountry of 468 square kilometres and 70,000 inhabitants \nwill never make the headlines or be discussed in \nprime time on the world\u2019s big international television \nchannels. But representing a small country gives us \nsome advantages, including one that I believe we \nshould underscore today. No one is as aware as we are \nof the importance of multilateral forums when it comes \nto resolving conflicts, strengthening international law \nand finding global solutions. No one is as aware as we \nare that to preserve individual identities and diversities \nwe must have a collective resolve and joint action.\n\nHistory has accustomed Andorrans to being affected \nby the geostrategic decisions of bigger countries and to \nsuffering indirectly the effects of instability occurring \nbeyond our borders. We know that in the great causes of \nhumanity such as the fight against climate change, our \nindividual actions will not have much influence if not \naccompanied by collective action. I could say the same \nof building a global economy that is more equitable and \nmore transparent. I have always said that the reality \nfor Andorra is also the reality for all, that for the \ngreat questions we address, the solutions all hinge on \nconsensus \u2014 otherwise they are not solutions. We must \nhave broad consensus based on individual convictions.\n\nThe convictions of Andorra are clear: they are the \nprinciples and values that almost 70 years ago inspired \nthe birth of the United Nations. Let us never forget the \nreason for this great Organization. If we forget, we are \nnot worthy of being here.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first of all like to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I assure him of the full support of my country. \nThe remarkable work of his predecessor, Mr. John \nWilliam Ashe, during the sixty-eighth session deserves \nour recognition. The same goes for the commendable \nand tireless efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nas head of the Organization.\n\nAt the previous session, we deplored and condemned \nthe cowardly terrorist attacks on the shopping centre in \nNairobi. Now, inevitably, the current session takes place \nin an equally worrisome context, marked by serious \nthreats to international peace and security. First, there \nis the advance of the elusive Boko Haram terrorist \nnetwork, which is extending its area of influence to \nthe border of the neighbouring countries of Gabon, \nwreaking havoc and killing without discrimination. \nThen, there is the recurrence of the epidemic of the \nEbola haemorrhagic fever, with an unprecedented \nincidence of infection, which is plunging Africa into \nmourning. Allow me to pay tribute to the memory of \nthose who have lost their lives trying to help those who \nare ill. I also pay solemn tribute to the men and women \nwho risk their lives in their daily fight to eradicate the \npandemic.\n\nGiven that the threat of Ebola is worldwide, national \nresponses should be replaced by a comprehensive \nmobilization at the global level. In that regard, my \ncountry welcomes the recent steps taken by the \nAfrican Union and the United Nations, as well as the \nmany national initiatives that have been announced. \nI welcome the United Nations decision to dispatch an \nemergency medical mission to fight the Ebola epidemic \nin the affected countries. My country, which prevailed \nin its fight against several Ebola crises in the past, \nintends to make available the International Centre for \nMedical Research Centre in Franceville. The Centre\u2019s \nexpertise in treating that disease has been proven.\n\n\nI am pleased that this session allows us to debate a \ntopic that concerns all of us, namely \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d. For Gabon, the report recently adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly on sustainable development goals \n(A/68/970) is a solid foundation in the development \nof that agenda. My country welcomes the fact that \nAfrican priorities, including the eradication of extreme \npoverty, the promotion of sustainable agriculture and \nindustrialization, and the protection of the environment, \nall figure prominently in that report.\n\nI would like to recall here that Gabon entered the \npost-2015 development agenda process when it began \nto implement the Strategic Plan for an Emerging \nGabon. The plan is based on a vision, an approach that \nhas led us to define a bold development programme. \nThat programme, of course, incorporates the concerns \nreflected in the Millennium Development Goals, as well \nas the challenges of climate change and food security. \nIt gives pride of place to everything that promotes the \nmaximization of our youth potential. The strategy \nimplemented by Gabon aims to accelerate the structural \ntransformation of its economy by moving from a rentier \neconomy to an economy of industries and services with \nhigh added-value in the near future.\n\nIn the current phase of implementing that \nprogramme, special attention is being devoted to \ncompetitiveness factors, such as the formation of \nhuman capital and the construction and upgrading of \ndevelopment infrastructure, including the development \nof a digital economy and the strengthening of energy-\nproduction capacities. Over the short term, we intend to \ndevote greater efforts to education and training in order \nto improve the performance of our basic education \nsystem. The goal here is to enhance the employability \nof our workforce, provide a qualified labour force for \nour labour market and accelerate the integration of \nyoung people into the workforce. The development of \nagriculture, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, as \nwell as food security, continues to receive sustained \nattention from my Government. Those are all areas \nwhere we thought it best to anticipate our leap in the \npost-2015 development agenda.\n\nIt is common knowledge that all those efforts can \ntruly thrive only in a political, economic and social \nenvironment marked by good governance. To that end, \nGabon has established various institutional instruments, \nsuch as the National Commission for the Fight against \nIllicit Enrichment, whose overall mission is to ensure \ntransparency and accountability in the management of \npublic funds. Since then, I have made the fight against \ncorruption a priority strategic objective. Right now, \nlarge-scale inspection and verification missions are \nunder way throughout the country with substantial \nresults. I remain firmly convinced that, in order to \nestablish a solid foundation for our post-2015 agenda, \nwe need to tailor our economic environment, so as \nto ensure that transparency guides the awarding of \npublic contracts and licenses, that investments produce \na good return, and that economic actors respect their \nobligations vis-\u00e0-vis the State.\n\nGabon\u2019s commitment to the fight against climate \nchange remains constant, given the seriousness of \nthe problem. Indeed, as has already been pointed out, \nthe latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change draws attention to the harsh reality \nof the damage caused by climate change. It would be \nwrong on our part to remain insensitive in the face of \nwhat is transpiring before our very eyes. That is why I \nwelcome the commitments made by the heads of State \nand Government at the end of the Climate Summit held \nhere on 23 September.\n\nI reiterate Gabon\u2019s determination to bear its share \nof our common duty. Gabon\u2019s objective is to reduce, \nby 2025, more than half the greenhouse gas emissions \nper capita produced by every Gabonese. My country \nwishes to strengthen its contribution to the efforts of \nthe international community aimed at the adoption of a \nmore binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. \nThat is the purpose of the meeting that we will organize \nin Libreville from 18 to 19 March 2015, our \u201cSouth \nClimate Initiative.\u201d As part of that initiative, which will \ntake place after the important Lima Conference, we, \nthe countries of the South, want to make a structured \ncontribution for the success of the Paris Conference. \nThe scale of climatic upheavals caused by global \nwarming shows that climate change is a vital, even \nexistential question. Given the extreme seriousness of \nthe danger confronting us, we must unite. We need to \nwork hand in hand towards the same goal, namely, to \nsave the planet in Paris in December 2015.\n\nIn just one year, our Organization will celebrate its \nseventieth anniversary. That maturity should enable it \nto better respond to the multifaceted challenges that it \nfaces. The effective implementation of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda must also be tackled. That is why \nwe must continue our efforts to resolve crises and \nhotbeds of tension in various parts of the world.\n\nRegarding the Central African Republic, Gabon \ncontinues to actively participate in the efforts of the \nEconomic Community of Central African States, the \nAfrican Union, the United Nations and the rest of the \ninternational community in seeking to stabilize the \npolitical, security, economic and humanitarian situation \non the ground.\n\nIn that connection, I want to pay tribute to the \nBrazzaville Forum for National Reconciliation in the \nCentral African Republic, which concluded with the \nsigning of a ceasefire agreement. Moreover, Gabon \nwelcomes the effective establishment of the United \nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \nMission in the Central African Republic, which took \nover from the African-led International Support \nMission to the Central African Republic. Regarding \nMali, Gabon supports the peace process that has been \nlaunched and supports the mediation efforts by Burkina \nFaso, Algeria and Morocco aimed at achieving a lasting \npeace. In South Sudan, Gabon supports the efforts \nof the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \nand the African Union in the search for a negotiated \npolitical solution between the two parties.\n\nRegarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I \nwelcome the signing, under Egyptian mediation, of a \nceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. My \nhope is that that truce lasts and promotes the resumption \nof direct negotiations to achieve the widely shared \nvision of creating a viable Palestinian State existing in \nharmony alongside Israel in peace and security, within \nsecure and internationally recognized borders.\n\nRegarding Western Sahara, Gabon welcomes the \nefforts based on dialogue and negotiations agreed to \nby our Organization. My country wants to reiterate its \nsupport for the Moroccan initiative, which we consider \nto be a courageous and realistic proposal that could lead \nto a lasting settlement. Finally, in terms of the embargo \nagainst Cuba, Gabon reiterates its position in favour of \nlifting it, because of its negative impact on the welfare \nof the population.\n\nNever has the terrorist threat been as strong \nas in recent times, jeopardizing the survival of the \ninstitutions of the countries affected by that terrible \nphenomenon. In Africa, Boko Haram\u2019s activism pushes \nentire populations to live far from their homes and in \nterror, poverty and despair.\n\nIn the Middle East, the so-called Islamic State \nhas extended its gruesome reign from eastern Syria \nto northern Iraq. Its establishment there has been \naccompanied by a lengthy sequence of rape, summary \nexecutions, decapitations and punishments of all types \ninflicted upon all those who, in the eyes of the extremists, \nsymbolize the rejection of their radicalization.\n\nAs no nation is now spared the murderous folly \nof those negative entities, the fight against terrorism \nneeds to be more concerted and organized. My country \nreiterates its support for international efforts undertaken \nto that end and reaffirms its firm condemnation of \nterrorist acts in all their forms and manifestations. In \nseeking to meet the security challenge of terrorism, \nwe need to strengthen the operational capacities of \nour defence and security forces in conformity with the \nspirit of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy.\n\nOur concerns for peace and security are \ncompounded by other cross-cutting threats, notably the \npoaching of and illicit trafficking in protected species. \nThat growing phenomenon, especially in Central \nAfrica, constitutes a threat at three levels: ecological, \neconomic and security. My country therefore remains \nwedded to the London initiative of February 2014. We \nreaffirm our commitment to opposing poaching and \nto implementing a moratorium on the ivory trade. To \nthat end, Gabon and Germany will organize tomorrow, \n26 September, a side event on the issue.\n\nMy country is more determined than ever to \ncooperate further with other States in formulating \na development tool that would take into account the \nglobal concerns of our populations. That will involve, \ninter alia, achieving progress in the reform of the United \nNations system. It is from that perspective that Gabon, \nlike other States Members of the United Nations, \nadheres to the \u201cDelivering as one\u201d initiative. Currently \nat the very core of United Nations reform, that approach \naims at improving the coherence of the United Nations \nsystem\u2019s operational development activities.\n\nRespect for human dignity and for fundamental \nfreedoms remains at the heart of my Government\u2019s \nconcerns. That factor underpins our chairmanship \nof the Human Rights Council, which we are holding \nin a very difficult international context marked by \nnumerous human rights violations. Despite all those \nchallenges, the Council has been able to react and to \nrespond with solutions to emergency situations caused \nby such violations. Gabon\u2019s leadership has allowed \nconstructive debate and has in particular prevented \na lapse into politicized and polarized discussions. I \n\n\nshould like to reiterate my gratitude to those countries \nthat have lent us their support to ensure the success of \nour mandate.\n\nFrom this rostrum, I encourage the inclusion of the \nhuman rights dimension in the current consideration of \nthe post-2015 agenda. Gabon urges such inclusion, and \nsuggests that particular emphasis be placed on the link \nbetween human rights and sustainable development. \nGiven all this, Gabon remains committed to engaging, \nalongside other States, in seeking collective solutions \nadapted to current challenges in preparation for a better \nworld.\n"

        "file_text": "The topic of this general debate, \n\u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative post-\n2015 development agenda\u201d, most fittingly depicts our \ncommon priority before the Organization\u2019s seventieth \nanniversary next autumn. We are about to set the stage \nfor strategic decisions and concrete actions that should \ndeliver comprehensive and transformational changes at \nthe global and national levels.\n\nWars and armed conflicts, natural diseases, \npandemic diseases, lingering poverty and many other \nexisting or potential threats to human lives and human \nrights keep on emerging. If we do not react adamantly \nand swiftly to tackle those perils early enough in their \n\n\nemerging phases, we run the risk that they will increase \nexponentially and beyond our control. More than ever \nbefore, we must face the fact that security, development \nand human rights are interdependent and mutually \nreinforcing. They demand to be at the very heart of the \npost-2015 agenda.\n\nAt this time, we are also witnessing a type of \ndangerous discord that spreads a fear of the worst \npossible outcome \u2014 the same kind of fear that preceded \nthe birth of the Organization. The Charter of the United \nNations provides us with so much wisdom; its words \ncame with the experience of the scourge of war and \nmisery. What we need at this point is to reinvigorate \nthe same level of determination we had almost seven \ndecades ago and to do everything we can to avoid \nregression.\n\nCroatia is deeply concerned about the situation \nin Ukraine. There is none but a peaceful solution \nto the conflict. The suffering of so many people is \nunfortunately all too familiar. Croatia echoes the call \nto stop the violence and to reach a political solution. \nCroatia strongly supports the principles of international \nlaw concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity \nof Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, we share the grave concern over the \nterrorism and violence spreading around the world, \nmost notably in the Middle East and Africa. The \nsheer magnitude of destruction, the loss of lives and \nunspeakable atrocities, most notably those committed \nby the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, can be \novershadowed only by the growing threat that they \nwill not stop soon or at any border, and that they will \ncontinue to grow and devour everything our civilization \nstands for. A zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism \nand a joint global effort are needed to prevent that from \nhappening. Croatia supports all ongoing efforts to form \na coalition against the so-called Islamic State. We stand \nready to make a contribution to Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish \nforces.\n\nAlso, although it is a difficult task, achieving \na stable and sustainable peace agreement between \nIsraelis and Palestinians is an imperative. We hope that \nhonest and serious efforts will be resumed to negotiate \na comprehensive and sustainable peace agreement that \nwill establish the grounds for a two-State solution, \nliving in peace and security, mutually recognizing \nand respecting each other, and gradually transforming \nthe entire Middle East into a region of peace and \ncooperation.\n\nThe situation in the world brings the need for \nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nto the centre of our attention. In that regard, the \n2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will \nbe of particular importance, and Croatia hopes that \nthe Treaty will be reinforced and strengthened as an \noutcome of the Conference. Croatia also commends \nthe unprecedented international effort aimed at the \ndestruction of the chemical weapons of the Syrian \nArab Republic. The Organization for the Prohibition \nof Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Mission\u2019s \nsuccessful work demonstrates the indispensable role of \nthe United Nations.\n\nIt is truly unnerving to be confronted with the \nproblems and crises that I have mentioned, while our \nvery best effort is needed to overcome obstacles such as \nclimate change, natural disasters and the scarcity and \ndegradation of resources, especially food and drinking \nwater. The crises are interlinked. Therefore, we need an \ninterlinked and integrated response to them. Again, no \nserious thought can be given to sustainable development \nwithout ensuring peace and security.\n\nSome conflicts could have been foreseen, prevented \nand even averted if the international community had \nacted in a timely and decisive way. While, indeed, the \nprimary responsibility lies with the sovereign State \nitself, regional and global organizations have the tools, \nand therefore also the obligation, to assist those States. \nOne effective method in that regard is peacebuilding, \nwhere we help post-conflict societies to stand on \ntheir own. There is a vast pool of global experience in \npeacebuilding that could be applied, including that of \nmy own country. We therefore hope that the upcoming \nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture \nwill consolidate the existing knowledge and experience \nand bring fresh ideas as to how to improve the overall \npeacebuilding process.\n\nA special role in maintaining peace and advancing \ndevelopment lies with women. In particular, we see \nthe role of women in achieving successful conflict \nresolution and the sustainable development of post-\nconflict societies. We strongly advocate women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment for peacebuilding and \ndevelopment. That is why we are organizing a high-\nlevel meeting at United Nations Headquarters on the \ngender dimension of sustainable development within \nthe context of post-conflict recovery on 26 September.\n\n\nThis week, we started discussing climate \nchange \u2014 the pressing issue of today. Croatia is as \nvulnerable as any other country. The devastating and \nunprecedented floods that we are witnessing now \nare proof of that. Yesterday, we all renewed our vow \nto boldly and ambitiously tackle that global issue, \nwhich is clearly of great importance. Croatia hopes \nthat the upcoming Lima and Paris conferences will \nlead us to a global agreement in key areas, including \nclimate financing and the reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions. That remains one of the main pillars of the \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda.\n\nBearing in mind the need for progress, we have \ncommitted ourselves to implementing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. That is our unfinished business. \nThe implementation and evaluation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals have made us all conscious of the \nfact that such a vital process needs to be continued. \nCroatia is pleased that, in that regard, we have been \nbuilding the truly transformative and people-centred \nframework of the sustainable development goals \n(SDGs). Those goals represent the central investment in \nour common future. We must put the maximum effort \ninto making the SDGs a reality and into supporting their \ncontinuous implementation at all levels. Those goals \nrepresent an opportunity for long-term development \nthat humankind cannot afford to miss. In that vein, we \nhave supported the importance of good governance and \nthe rule of law as the enablers and an inseparable part \nof sustainable development. Everyone has a role to play: \nnational Governments, international organizations, the \nprivate sector, civil society, academia, the media and \nthe various other stakeholders.\n\nA key principle that matters to my country is \nequality among all human beings, regardless of their \nbeliefs, race, gender, national origin, ethnicity, religion, \ndisability, sexual orientation or other status. Croatia \nfully supports the pivotal role of the United Nations \nand its human rights mechanisms, in particular the \nHuman Rights Council, on the two tracks, namely, to \nfurther develop and strengthen the protection of human \nrights and to effectively respond in a timely way to \nthe challenges of the gross violation and systematic \nabuse of human rights worldwide. We firmly believe \nthat sustainable development goes hand in hand \nwith democracy, which should be approached in a \nholistic manner. That said, a number of international \nmechanisms ensure stable democracies and sustainable \ndevelopment by eliminating double standards, \ninsecurity and impunity. We therefore add our voice to \nthe calls for universal adherence to the Rome Statute \nand the universal jurisdiction of the International \nCriminal Court.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, we have recently \nwitnessed all kinds of natural disasters. Such situations \ndemand swift and prompt national and international \nactions, first and foremost, to mitigate the immediate \nthreat, as the same time as taking care of victims and \ndelivering humanitarian aid. The outbreak of epidemic \ndiseases also has a similar effect. A recent example is \nthe Ebola epidemic in some West African nations. It \ndenotes a matter for solidarity and understanding and \ndemands the world\u2019s immediate and comprehensive \nresponse to the multifaceted medical, social, economic \nand security crisis.\n\nCroatia will continue to provide assistance to \nthe most vulnerable people, especially considering \nthat we have rich expertise in the area of capacity-\nbuilding programmes in a humanitarian crisis, in \nraising awareness of the dangers of landmines and \nother unexploded ordnance of war and in providing \npsychosocial support to victims of violence. In addition, \nlet me point out that Croatia was dedicated and active \nin delivering humanitarian aid to the flooded regions \nof its neighbouring countries of Serbia and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina this spring, while we ourselves also faced \ngrave floods and their consequences in Croatia. We \nall need more solidarity at the regional and the global \nlevels.\n\nOne of the most important goals of my presidency \nhas been and continues to be the promotion of dialogue \nand cooperation instead of conflict as a means of \nachieving security and stability for Croatia, as well as \nevery other country in the world. I am proud to say that \nCroatia has come a long way in that respect.\n\nWith the World Summit in 2005, we started \nreforming the United Nations system. Despite all \nthe progress made, we have not managed to achieve \nconcrete results with regard to the reform of the \nSecurity Council. Moreover, we would like to see the \nCouncil more engaged in preventing crises and its \nongoing dedication to its Charter duties rather than \nto any particular interest. In order to maintain the \nCouncil\u2019s authority, relevance and indispensability in \nmaintaining global peace and security, its reform needs \nto be comprehensive and without further delay.\n\nOn numerous occasions, Croatia has stated its \nposition on Security Council reform. In our view, the \n\n\nenlargement should happen in both the permanent \nand the non-permanent categories of membership, \nincluding one additional non-permanent seat for the \nEastern European States. The enlargement is closely \nlinked to the reform of the working methods of the \nSecurity Council, including the question of the use \nof the veto power. Croatia welcomes and supports the \ninitiative to establish a code of conduct with regard to \nthe suspension of the use of the veto in cases relating to \na mass crime.\n\nOn another note, we strongly believe that the \nconsolidation of the European space will be possible \nonly through the further stabilization and security \nof South-Eastern Europe. We look forward to the \nday when all countries of the region will finally be \nadmitted to the European Union. Croatia has been and \nwill continue to be an advocate for a continuous and \nstrong focus on South-Eastern Europe. The countries \nof the region are finding an increasing number of ways \nto cooperate together and to lay the foundation for the \njoint development of sustainable peace and stability, \nbe it with regard to the recent devastating floods or to \ndealing with a difficult past, while achieving truth and \njustice on the issues of missing persons or of setting the \nstage for major infrastructure and transport projects.\n\nIn conclusion, allow me to address an issue that \nI personally believe can be one of the best remedies \nfor achieving social improvement, economic advance \nand, consequently, political stability \u2014 education. \nThat is why I strongly support the Secretary-General\u2019s \nGlobal Education First Initiative. Knowledge and \neducation are major driving forces of societies and one \nof the most important preconditions for success and \nsustainable development. Disparities in knowledge and \nits distribution, access and application have become \nmajor factors in determining the overall success of a \nnation and the level of its development. It is the best \nguarantee that the world\u2019s development and stability \nwill go hand in hand and that global peace and security \nwith thus become stronger than ever.\n"

At the same time, and as we approach \nthe seventieth year since the creation of the most \nimportant debating forum in the history of humankind, \nwe believe it right to recall that our Organization, the \nUnited Nations, was created precisely as a forum for \npeace among peace-loving nations, as expressed at the \nvarious international conferences that led to its creation.\nThat reminder seems even timely and relevant to us, \nsince the concept of peace is now more necessary than \never in various parts of the world such as the Middle \nEast and the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Republic of Paraguay reiterates its commitment \nto ensuring that all social issues are addressed. In that \nregard, the Government of President Horacio Manuel \nCartes Jara is dealing decisively with the development, \nexecution and implementation of social policies that \naddress various demands, with special emphasis on \nthe needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged \nsectors of our population, including the elderly, the \n\nrural population, indigenous communities, migrants, \nchildren, adolescents and women. We have an obligation \nto enable members of those groups to be included as \nfull citizens.\n\nIn that regard, I would make a special reference to \nthe World Conference of Indigenous Peoples, held at \nHeadquarters a few days ago, which was convened to \nlisten to the true thoughts and feelings of our native \nand indigenous peoples. Indigenous cultural heritage \nhas been and remains one of the key elements shaping \nParaguay\u2019s cultural identity and has led to miscegenation \nas the main social factor unifying the native Guarani \npopulation and the European conquerors. Our country \nis proud of the linguistic, cultural and political character \nof Paraguay, which boasts the native Guarani language \nof our ancestors as its everyday language.\n\nIn line with the efforts made by the Government \nsince it took office in August 2013, we believe solidarity \nand partnership is necessary among countries, whether \ndeveloping or developed, and international financing \ninstitutions. We also take into account the fact that, \noften, vulnerability stems from other areas, such as a \nlack of decent jobs, educational opportunities, access to \ninternational markets and timely cooperation and from \nissues for which responsibility does not lie exclusively \nwith the State but also with the private sector, as it \ngenerates wealth and decent employment. In that \nregard, we call on the United Nations bodies that work \nfor cooperation to further strengthen their presence \nin Paraguay and support national policies aimed at \nstrengthening democracy and social justice.\n\nFor the first time since its inception nearly a decade \nago, my country is aspiring to secure a seat on the \nHuman Rights Council for the 2015-2017 period. For the \nRepublic of Paraguay, the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights are the foundation for effective democracy. \nThey are fundamental values that are enshrined and \nguaranteed in our Constitution, which expressly \nstates that international human rights treaties cannot \nbe rejected except through the procedures governing \namendments to our Constitution. On the basis of those \nconstitutional assurances and commitments, we are \nconfident that we can play more than a constructive \nrole and thus consolidate the actions of the Council to \neffectively strengthen the promotion and protection of \nhuman rights around the world.\n\nParaguay, in accordance with its Government\u2019s \npolicy, will continue to continuously support and \nfollow issues in the United Nations relating to the \npromotion of youth participation in social and economic \ndevelopment, persons with disabilities, migrant \nworkers, the elimination of violence against women, \nthe rights of the child, the elimination of discrimination \non the basis of religious beliefs and the protection of \nhuman rights and their relation to extreme poverty.\n\nIn Paraguay, we support the globalization of \ndemocracy through social development. We also believe \nin universal security based on respect for human rights \nas an unwavering commitment to the dignity of human \nlife. We therefore hope to build a regional and global \ncommunity that, hand in hand and in solidarity, devotes \nits efforts to eradicating hunger and poverty, effectively \ncooperating to promote the participation of all, in \nprosperity, through quality education and a system of \ninclusive social protection.\n\nAs a sign of Paraguay\u2019s desire to respond to the \nchanging times, our President recently promulgated the \nLaw on Free Access by Citizens to Public Information \nand Government Transparency as an important tool \nenabling every citizen to act as comptroller of public \nexpenditures. The Law, which was recently adopted, \nstates that all institutions must disseminate information \nas widely as possible. The Law also guarantees access \nby every citizen to all public information.\n\nWe in Paraguay believe that the concept of \ndevelopment should include, as a sine qua non, the \nprinciple of social inclusion. The major challenge of \nachieving development that overcomes asymmetries \nleads inevitably to efforts promoting and achieving \nan optimal quality of life for all our citizens without \nexception. We must give a human face to our growth. \nOur citizens deserve, and have the right to, a more \ndignified life and overall well-being.\n\nWe are currently working to establish a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda that is sustainable and has a focus \non poverty, education, health and social inclusion. We \nhave learned that the Millennium Development Goals \nhave been and are important but not sufficient, and \nthat humankind should be the focus of policy. In that \ncontext, we believe that, for the post-2015 development \nagenda to be successful, it must be accompanied by a \nbetter distribution of international financial resources.\n\nParaguay needs international cooperation that \nis aligned with its socioeconomic priorities, the \ndevelopment and strengthening of its institutions and \npreferential treatment for its most vulnerable sectors. \nWe hope that the opening of developing countries \n\n\nhelps bridge inequalities and that the same restrictions \nthat the more developed economies are demanding \nin the process of their own development will not \nbe applied. Paraguay\u2019s position, like that of many \ndeveloping countries, is that South-South cooperation \nis not a substitute for but a complement to North-South \ncooperation and triangular cooperation. We believe \nthat the United Nations, as the universal forum, should \nplay a central role in ensuring success in our efforts to \nachieve better international coordination and coherence \nin the economic and financial spheres.\n\nAs the high-level Climate Summit was also held a \nfew days ago here at Headquarters in New York, we \nbelieve it is necessary to recall that Paraguay is aware \nthat climate change poses a serious and complex threat \nto the world, as highlighted by the growing negative \nimpacts we are experiencing due to the resulting \ndroughts, floods and other adverse phenomena, which \nspread poverty, cause forced displacements and may \naffect international peace and security.\n\nThis situation urgently requires a coordinated and \nresponsible global response in order to find ways to \nmitigate, alleviate and reverse climate change\u2019s tragic \nand devastating consequences. In addition, Paraguay \nsupports the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities, on the basis of which countries that \nhave contributed more to the historical and current \nlevels of pollution must shoulder correspondingly \ngreater responsibilities. That principle should be used \nas an objective criterion, and its implementation will \ncontribute to efforts to mitigate the global impact of \nclimate change.\n\nThe issue of landlocked developing countries is \nof fundamental importance for Paraguay\u2019s foreign \npolicy. The asymmetries and disadvantages that that \ngeographical situation brings about will be offset only \nif there is international recognition of the need for a \nspecial and differential agreement on the country\u2019s \nintegration into the globalized world. Paraguay, along \nwith other landlocked developing countries in the world, \nof which there are over 30, faces difficulties in terms of \nopen access to international markets, mainly owing to \nthe restrictions on free transit through transit countries \nand the lack of special and differential treatment, \nwhich would allow them to engage in greater and more \ncompetitive participation in world markets.\n\nThis year is particularly important for us because \nin November the second United Nations Conference on \nLandlocked Developing Countries, to be held in Vienna, \nwill review the Almaty Programme of Action. While \nthe condition of being a landlocked developing country \nis a disadvantage for Paraguay, we are convinced that \nwe can overcome that adversity. We are working so \nthat our territory can become, in the very near future, a \nfavourable environment for integration and productive \ncommunication between the two major oceans, the \nAtlantic and the Pacific. The new programme of action \nto be adopted at the Vienna Conference should be the \nframework for mutually beneficial cooperation between \nlandlocked developing countries and transit countries.\n\nDisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control \nare not just key factors to ensure international peace and \nsecurity, but also guarantee that the most vulnerable \ncountries can achieve sustained socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Only by securing a strong multilateral \nsystem with strict respect for the rule of law at the \ninternational and national levels can we ensure our \nmutual security. We are convinced that universal \nand binding international instruments in the area of \ndisarmament and the Arms Trade Treaty, which will \nenter into force in the near future, will help improve the \neffectiveness of existing regional initiatives to prevent \nirresponsible actors from gaining access to weapons.\n\nAgain, we urge Israel and Palestine to lay \nthe foundation for social, political and economic \nreconstruction, which should enable both peoples \nto live in peace and harmony. Today more than ever, \nwe must promote the negotiation process between the \nparties, which can lead to lasting peace so that Israel \nand Palestine can live side by side with secure borders \nand in peace.\n\nI also wish to note that Paraguay recognizes \nand welcomes the participation and contributions \nof the Republic of China (Taiwan) to United Nations \nspecialized agencies, thanks to a rapprochement \nbetween the two parties of the Taiwan Strait. In a \nworld beset by conflicts, my Government welcomes \nthe efforts made by the Republic of China (Taiwan) \nto reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait, which \nhave contributed significantly to ensuring peace and \nstability.\n\nThe Republic of Paraguay reiterates its commitment \nto international peace and security. In that context, \nwe reaffirm the political will to increase, to the extent \npracticable, our contribution of troops to peacekeeping \noperations and to continue to train and equip \npeacekeeping forces in accordance with standards \nestablished by the United Nations, so as to progressively \n\n\nincrease our participation in those missions. Regionally, \nwe recognize the progress achieved by the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, where the \npresence of specialized personnel in Paraguay\u2019s armed \nforces, working with other countries in our region, have \nplayed a significant role in humanitarian assistance and \ninfrastructure engineering projects and in improving \nthe long-term standard of living to benefit many \ngenerations of Haitians.\n\nSince its inception, the United Nations has focused \nall its efforts on constantly evolving so that it can \nbecome a global structure capable of meeting the \ncurrent needs of Member States. It is in the desire \nfor such evolution that Paraguay supports the reform \nprocess for the Organization, thereby strengthening the \nGeneral Assembly, which will lead to the restoration \nof functions entrusted to that body by the Charter of \nthe United Nations, as the Assembly is the sole body \nwith universal representation. On the issue of Security \nCouncil reform, we urge that such reform be done in \naccordance with the primary purpose of creating a more \ndemocratic Council. We can no longer delay expansion \nof that body. The Council must be more equitable, \ninclusive and democratic, reflecting the number of \nmembers of our Organization. We must improve its \nworking methods and ensure greater transparency in \nits management.\n\nAs we commemorate in 2015 the seventieth \nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, \nwe hope to celebrate concrete results in the work of the \nOrganization that transcend the mere celebration of \nthe passage of time. We believe that consolidating the \nsubstantive post-2015 development agenda should lead \nto effective and real development for future generations. \nThat is the greatest legacy we can leave.\n\nFinally, we urge the General Assembly to find \nmore equitable and just means for establishing the list \nof speakers of Heads of State and Government for next \nyear\u2019s general debate.\n"

        "file_text": "I am here to pay \nmy country\u2019s highest tribute to the United Nations for \nthe work it has done to improve the lives of people \naround the world. Thailand is fully committed to what \nthe United Nations stands for and to realizing through \nthe United Nations the hopes we all share. We are also \nfirmly committed to fulfilling our responsibilities as \na Member of the United Nations, because the United \nNations can achieve its vision only when we act together \nin unity.\n\nThis year, the theme is the post-2015 development \nagenda and how to truly make a difference in the lives \nof the people on the ground. Many countries have \nachieved many of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). For example, they have succeeded in reducing \npoverty and have achieved their education and health-\ncare goals. But there are many other countries for which \nachieving the MDGs has not been easy. Therefore, as \nwe move towards the post-2015 development agenda, \nwe must renew our commitments to make sure that no \none is left behind.\n\nFor Thailand, development is not just about gross \ndomestic product. To be sustainable, development must \ngo hand in hand with democracy, human rights and \npeace and security, the pillars of the United Nations. \nIt must be allowed to grow in an environment that \nis free from conflict. Building a strong and robust \ndemocracy is the challenge that many of us face. As in \nmany countries, Thailand has learned the lesson that \ndemocracy is more than having elections. Democracy \nmust be based on respect for the rule of law, and it must \nbe about good governance, transparency, accountability \nand equal access to justice.\n\nThat was not the case for my country before 22 May. \nBefore that date, we were at a political impasse. We \nhad a dysfunctional democracy. We were in danger of \nmore turmoil. And there was a very real possibility \nof bloodshed. Political opposition parties were given \nthe chance to save democracy, but they failed because \nthey were unwilling to compromise for the sake of \nthe country. That chain of unfortunate events made \nthe military intervention necessary. We all wished \nthat things had not had to turn out that way. But if the \nsituation had been allowed to continue, Thailand\u2019s \ndemocracy would have been torn apart. That would \nhave undermined Thailand\u2019s stability and the stability \nof the region.\n\nThailand is now going through a period of transition. \nWe remain fully committed to democracy and human \nrights, and we know we cannot go against the tide of \ndemocracy. Thailand needs a real and functioning \ndemocracy, one that delivers on the aspirations of \nthe people. Let there be no doubt that Thailand is not \nretreating from democracy. But we do need time and \nspace to bring about reconciliation, undertake political \nreform and strengthen our democratic institutions. We \ndo not want a repeat of what happened on 22 May.\n\nIn addition to implementing our road map for \nreturning to full democracy, we are also getting our \neconomy moving again. Confidence has returned and \ngrowth has been restored.\n\nThailand is committed to playing an active role \nwith its partners in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) in order to build an ASEAN \ncommunity of peace and prosperity. We are committed \nto working with our partners in the international \ncommunity to address the many global challenges \nwe face, such as climate change, transnational crime, \npandemics and human trafficking. Most of all, we are \ncommitted to working with our partners to realize \nthe development agenda, because real and lasting \npeace is based not on State-centred security but on \npeople-centred security.\n\nDevelopment must transform people\u2019s lives and \nopen the door to a better future for all. Development \nmust empower individuals, communities and societies. \nThat lies at the heart of the sufficiency-economy \nphilosophy of His Majesty the King of Thailand, and \nthat philosophy has guided our development efforts for \ndecades. The sufficiency economy is about promoting \nthe right values, drawing on the inner strengths of each \ncommunity and building resilience from the grass-\nroots level up. In doing so, we are able to lay a solid \nfoundation for sustainable economic development at \nthe national level.\n\nBut in today\u2019s world, no nation can be an island of \nprosperity unto itself. More than ever, we need a strong \nglobal partnership, whether in order to realize the post-\n2015 development agenda or to meet shared challenges.\n\nFirst of all, that partnership must meet the \nchallenge of human security, the most pressing of our \n\ntime. Human security is about human dignity, human \nrights, equity, equality and social justice, the promise \nof a better future for all and ensuring that in our rush \nfor development we do not sacrifice the environment \nthat sustains us. Ensuring human security should be at \nthe heart of sustainable development.\n\nBut while we advance the development agenda, we \ncannot ignore the immediate threats that require our \nconcerted action. Today we are confronted with some \nimmediate threats to the global partnership, such as the \nEbola crisis and the humanitarian crises in the Middle \nEast \u2014 Syria, Libya, Iraq and the Gaza Strip. It pains \nus to witness the senseless death of civilians, especially \nchildren, in the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The situation \ndemands that we work even harder to bring lasting peace \nto the Palestinian people and to meet their aspirations \nto statehood, as well as to affirm the legitimate right of \nthe Israeli people to security.\n\nAs the situation in the Middle East unfolds, we \nare also deeply concerned about the rising threat \nof radicalism and extremism. There can be no \njustification for the brutalities and atrocities we have \nseen. We must rise to that challenge to peace, to our \npeoples\u2019 livelihoods and to the gains we have made in \neconomic and social development. While some radical \nand extremist movements have indeed been able to \ndraw recruits from many parts the world, their mission \nis nothing more than the use of terrorism and fear of to \nadvance their objectives.\n\nOur peace and security and development are \nall connected. In order to achieve them, we must all \ntry to contribute as much as we can and to meet our \ninternational responsibilities as best we can. Some of \nus may have the capacity to do more than others. But \nif we all do our part, we can make the world better and \nsafer. That is why Thailand has sent volunteers to its \nneighbours to work in health and education and why we \nsent medical teams to Japan in 2011 as part of the relief \nefforts following the earthquake and tsunami.\n\nThe Thai flag and Thai personnel have been \nassociated with peacekeeping operations in many \nplaces around the world. We were in Timor-Leste and \nin the Sudan, and along the India-Pakistan border. \nAnd we were part of the coalition formed to combat \npiracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. \nThe role of the military, however, is not limited to war \nand conflict alone. Even in times of peace it plays an \nimportant role, especially now, when we are dealing \nwith many challenges such as natural disasters. That \nis why Thailand is promoting humanitarian assistance \nand disaster relief cooperation in the ASEAN region \nand beyond. Perhaps the time has come for ASEAN to \nbegin to explore the idea of a regional humanitarian \nassistance disaster recovery task force.\n\n\nAs members of the international community, \nwe must all share the responsibility to stay true to \nthe original promise of the United Nations, which \nis to promote social progress and better standards of \nliving in larger freedom for the peoples of the world. \nIt is because of Thailand\u2019s commitment to the United \nNations that we have submitted our candidature for a \nseat on the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 \nterm and on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 \nterm. We hope our friends will once again give us their \ntrust and allow us to serve.\n\nWhether the issue is democracy, development or \npeace, we all must assume our responsibilities because \nwe are, after all, a family of United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, I would like to extend my \nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I assure you of our full support and cooperation \nin the discharge of your duties. I would also like to \nsincerely commend His Excellency Mr. John Ashe for \nthe successful completion of his work as President of \nthe Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\n\nWe have just over 450 days remaining for the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). While many countries have made considerable \nachievements and will achieve the MDGs, others, like \nthe least developed countries, have seen slow progress \nand face various challenges in achieving all Goals \nwithin the time frame. Moreover, complex regional \nand international situations, such as armed conflicts, \npolitical unrest, pandemics and environmental \ndegradation, among others, have inevitably brought \nabout more obstacles to those countries\u2019 efforts to \nrealize the MDGs.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, based on past experience, \nit is evident that socioeconomic development in any \ncountry can succeed only in an enabling, lasting and \nsecure environment. Only under such conditions could \nwe employ all efforts and draw on all potential and \nresources available in the country for development in \nthe most effective and sustainable manner.\n\nOver the 39 years of its existence, since the war \nended, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has \ndeployed all its efforts in national development, \nstarting from the period of healing the wounds of war \nto the era of formulating and implementing the seventh \nfive-year national socioeconomic development plan, \nbased on the renovation policy set by the Lao People\u2019s \nRevolutionary Party. The achievements made in each \nperiod are the results of lessons learned through actual \ndevelopment activities carried out and from adapting \nto specific conditions within the country and to the \nexternal environment.\n\nLessons learned from friendly countries, both \nnear and far, are valuable assets. We therefore would \nlike to express our sincere appreciation to all friendly \ncountries for sharing their knowledge and experience, \nincluding both successes and failures, with the small \nand young Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in each \nperiod.\n\nThe mid-term review of the implementation of the \nseventh five-year national socioeconomic development \nplan has shown that the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic has made remarkable achievements in many \nareas, especially in maintaining a steady pace of \neconomic growth, political stability and social order, \nthus ensuring that the Lao people of all ethnic groups \ncan enjoy their legitimate rights and freedom and can \nactively participate in national development. That has \nlaid a solid foundation for the country to move towards \nrealizing its ultimate goal of graduating from the least \ndeveloped country status by 2020. The achievements so \nfar were made possible not only due to national efforts, \nbut also through the support and cooperation extended \nby friendly countries and development partners, \nincluding international organizations, especially the \nUnited Nations system.\n\nNevertheless, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic has also been affected by the global financial \nand economic crisis in recent years. That has given rise \nto major obstacles to national economic development as \nwell as to the implementation of various development \ngoals. In that regard, the Lao Government has taken \ntimely measures to stabilize its macroeconomy, aimed \nat promoting sustained growth in the coming years.\n\nIn addition, as a landlocked and least developed \ncountry, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nremains vulnerable. It still faces numerous challenges, \nespecially in achieving some of the MDG targets, \nincluding reducing child malnutrition, ensuring gender \nequality in education and reducing child and maternal \nmortality.\n\nMinimizing the impact of unexploded ordnance \n(UXO) dropped during the war also remains a challenge. \nTaking into account the importance of dealing with \nthat matter, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has \nadopted a localized millennium development goal on \naddressing the impact of UXO, as its national MDG 9.\n\nReducing the impact of UXO remains a huge \nburden and task for the country, as it hampers national \ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. In that \nconnection, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nis one of the countries that initiated the process to \nformulate the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions. \nThe full and effective implementation of the Oslo \nConvention is of great importance, because it will lead \nto a total prohibition of the use, production or transfer \nof cluster munitions.\n\nIn that connection, I take this opportunity to convey \nour congratulations to Saint Kitts and Nevis, Belize \nand the Republic of the Congo on their ratification of \nthe Oslo Convention, which increased the total number \nof States having done so to 86. We hope that other \ncountries will also consider becoming parties to the \nConvention.\n\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic shares \nthe common concern over the escalating armed \n\nconflicts in different parts of the world, which are \nposing increasingly major threats to the international \ncommunity. We urge all parties concerned to exercise \nthe utmost restraint and refrain from taking any action \nthat could cause loss of people\u2019s lives or property. Only \nthrough addressing those conflicts by peaceful means \ncan we ensure mutual trust. Resentment and hostility \nagainst one another lead to escalating violence and use \nof force, resulting in loss of life and property and pain \nand suffering for innocent people.\n\nIn addition, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nshares the strong concern about the escalating conflict \nin Palestine, which has led to loss of Palestinian lives. \nWe therefore urge a peaceful resolution of the issue of \nPalestine.\n\nIn this era of interdependence, cooperation and \nengagement are key factors for peaceful and mutually \nbeneficial coexistence. The enforcement of isolation and \nof sanction measures imposed on any country may not \nbenefit the international community. On the contrary, it \nmay cause losses to all and lead to increasing hostility. \nLikewise, the unilateral embargo on the Republic of \nCuba \u2014 a sovereign State \u2014 for many decades has had \na major impact on the lives of the peace-loving Cuban \npeople. Therefore, it is now time to lift the embargo.\n\nIn this complex and challenging global environment, \nthe United Nations, the only universal organization, \nunder the leadership of Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, has made tireless efforts to seek ways and \nmeans to address these international issues, promote \ncooperation for sustainable development and poverty \neradication and maintain peace, stability and security \nin the world. I would like to take this opportunity \nto commend the Secretary-General for his various \ninitiatives in addressing issues of common concern, \nincluding the organization of the Climate Summit, \nwhich has just been successfully concluded.\n\nNevertheless, amid complex and unpredictable \ncircumstances, the United Nations needs to strengthen \nitself through the reform of various organs so that it \ncan more effectively carry out its mandate and fulfil \nits obligations. The international community is hoping \nto see further tangible progress next year on the \nreform of the United Nations, on the occasion marking \nthe seventieth anniversary of the founding of the \nOrganization.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) is a regional organization that has enjoyed \nrapid growth, and all ASEAN-initiated mechanisms \nare bearing fruitful results. We are therefore convinced \nthat ASEAN community-building in 2015 will be \nsuccessful, turning ASEAN into a single market and \nproduction base with increased competitiveness, thus \npromoting trade and investment in the region and \nbetween ASEAN and its external partners. ASEAN is \nnow earnestly mapping out the ASEAN Community \nPost-2015 Vision, aimed at strengthening and ensuring \nASEAN unity while promoting peace and security in the \nregion and the world at large. On that note, we hope that \nthe international community will continue to support \nthe implementation of the ASEAN Community Post-\n2015 Vision, as well as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic\u2019s ASEAN chairmanship in 2016, after ASEAN \nbecomes a Community.\n\nLandlocked developing countries (LLDCs) compose \none of the groups of countries in special situations that \nare recognized by the international community. After \n10 years of implementation of the Almaty Programme of \nAction on addressing the specific problems and special \nneeds of LLDCs, it has been noted that many objectives \nhave not been realized, thus those countries continue to \nface daunting challenges and marginalization in many \nareas.\n\nMore than half of the LLDCs are also least developed \ncountries. In that context, the second United Nations \nConference on Landlocked Developing Countries, to be \nheld in November in Vienna, is of great significance \nto LLDCs, as it will conduct the 10-year review of the \nimplementation of Almaty Programme of Action and \nadopt a new programme of action for the next decade. \nOn that note, we would like to call upon all stakeholders, \nincluding transit countries and development partners, \nto participate actively in the Conference with a view to \nensuring its successful outcome. Also, we call on the \ninternational community to support the implementation \nof the new programme of action in order to help \nthose countries overcome their special problems and \nchallenges and achieve sustainable development.\n\nThe year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary \nof the founding of the United Nations. We hope that \nthe international community will spare no effort in \nbuilding a peaceful, secure and prosperous world.\n"

        "file_text": "Ukraine, as a co-founder \nof the United Nations, knows why we established this \nOrganization \u2014 for peace and stability. Do we have \nthis peace and stability? No, and yet our global aim and \nglobal target is to do everything we can to protect our \ncitizens and to deliver peace to our nations. The global \nagenda today consists of a number of things. Everyone \nhas mentioned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, \neveryone has mentioned Ebola, and everyone has \nmentioned Ukraine. Frankly speaking I would be happy \nnot to be in this situation, but we are a country that \nknows what terrorism means, and not in words but in \ndeeds, in practice.\n\nLet me remind Members of the origin of the conflict \nthat is evolving in Ukraine. Is it a domestic conflict? \nNo. It is true that my country has some internal \ndifferences, but every country has differences and we \nare ready to handle and tackle those differences inside \nour country. The origin of the conflict is an invasion \nby the Russian Federation. A permanent member of \nthe Security Council has violated the United Nations \nCharter, which is absolutely and entirely unacceptable \nbehaviour, especially on the part of a permanent \nmember of the Council. It would be better for Russia to \nbe an \u201cinsecurity\u201d member rather than a security one.\n\nTwenty years ago, Ukraine abandoned its nuclear \nweapons. We possessed the third-biggest arsenal in \nthe world. When we agreed to relinquish our nuclear \npower arsenal in Budapest, Ukraine got guarantees \nof territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia was a \nco-signer of and co-contributor to that memorandum. \nInstead of security guarantees, 20 years later we \nreceived Russian military boots on Ukrainian soil. It \nseems that it is difficult to convince another country \nto stop nuclear proliferation. We are committed to our \nnuclear non-proliferation programme, but we need \nto have valid guarantees of our territorial integrity, \nsecurity and independence.\n\nA few months ago, the Russian Federation \nannexed Crimea. One country, which is a Member \nState of the United Nations and a permanent member \nof the Security Council, a country that is armed to the \nteeth, just decided to grab the land of its neighbour, \nindependent Ukraine. Let me commend the efforts of \nUnited Nations Member States that overwhelmingly \nsupported the resolution supporting Ukraine\u2019s \nterritorial integrity and condemning the illegal \nannexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. They \nmoved further. For today we can state that Russian \ntroops are deployed in the east of Ukraine. The Russian\nFederation violated a number of bilateral and \nmultilateral international agreements, starting with the \nUnited Nations Charter and ending with the resolutions \non counter-terrorism that were adopted at the United \nNations.\n\nWe know what terrorism means, and we urge Russia \nto pull back its forces, to pull back its artillery, to stop \nsupplying Russian-led terrorists, to restore control over \nthe Ukrainian-Russian border, and to start real talks, \npeace talks. We are the country that needs peace. It is \ndifficult to hammer out any kind of peace deal at the \nbarrel of a gun made in Russia.\n\nLet me remind members of a tragedy that happened \nbecause of the Russian invasion. A few months ago, a \ncivilian aircraft, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, was \ndowned by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, and \n298 innocent civilians were killed. Ukraine mourns the \nvictims. We pray together with the families from the \nNetherlands, Australia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, \nIndonesia, the Philippines and Germany. Ukraine \nhanded over the investigation to an independent body \nwhich is Dutch-led. We urge everyone to help us to \nbring to justice those responsible for this despicable \ncrime, a crime against humanity.\n\nEvery day, despite the ceasefire, we are losing \nUkrainian soldiers and civilians, and the shelling \nis still going on. I reiterate once again that we need \npeace. What is the formula for this peace? The military \noption is definitely not the best option. It has to be a \ncomprehensive approach which comprises diplomatic, \nfinancial, political and, only at the last, military options.\n\nThe United States and the European Union \nimposed a number of sanctions against Russia. We do \nunderstand that sanctions are the way to start real talks \n\nand to hammer out a peace deal. We have no trust in \nwords. We have trust only in deeds and actions. Once \nagain we reiterate our commitment to restore law and \norder. We urge the Russian Federation to stick to its \ninternational obligation to execute everything that was \nwritten in Minsk. This is not a menu where one can \npick the cherry. It means that Russia is to execute all \n12 points of this memorandum. We ask our partners not \nto lift sanctions until Ukraine takes over control of its \nentire territory, starting with the east of Ukraine and \nending with Crimea. Crimea was, is and will be a part \nof Ukraine.\n\nLet me end with a direct message to the Russian \nPresident. Mr. Putin can win the fight against the \ntroops, but he will never win the fight against a united \nUkrainian nation."

        "file_text": "The President of the Republic of Cameroon, His \nExcellency Mr. Paul Biya, has requested me to convey \nto members, the Secretary-General and his fellow staff \nhis warm greetings and to deliver his statement before \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\n\n\u201cNext year, we should adopt the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda in follow-up to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Throughout the sixty-\neighth session, our representatives actively worked \nto develop new goals to pick up the MDG torch. \nThat important task, since it concerns the raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre of the Organization, is not finished. It will \nbe incumbent upon the President to see it through. \nI am sure that he will succeed. Rest assured of the \nfull and wholehearted cooperation of my country \nin that regard.\n\u201cFor the post-2015 period, the United Nations \nseeks a transformative agenda that gives priority \nto the eradication of poverty and hunger, as well \nas to sustained and inclusive economic growth. \nCameroon fully shares that vision.\n\u201cIn Cameroon, since 2010, we have implemented \na strategy for growth and employment whose \nprimary purpose is indeed the reduction of poverty. \nThe measures taken in that regard aim in particular \nat creating jobs and improving the living conditions \nof the population. The recovery of our economy and \nour public finances, which has fostered the return \nof growth, bodes well for the success of our efforts. \nHowever, such progress, substantial and significant \nas it is, has not yet enabled us to eradicate poverty. \nIn the areas of education, health care, access to \nwater and electricity, roads, et cetera, there is still \na long way to go in order to meet the needs of our \npeople.\n\u201cMost of the countries targeted by the \nMDGs \u2014 the developing countries \u2014 face similar \nsituations. That is why, like the President, we \nsupport a transformative post-2015 agenda. That \nwill clearly require some changes to our approach \nto development. It should no longer be seen as an \nexternal process but, rather, as an expression of \nthe wishes and needs of the target populations. \nMoreover, that is the common position of the \nAfrican countries.\n\u201cFollowing a review of the MDGs, it will also \nbe necessary to establish a follow-up mechanism \nfor the goals of the new system. Finally, we will \ninevitably have to change the way in which \ndevelopment aid is financed in order to improve its \neffectiveness.\n\u201cOnce those conditions are met, we should \nwork on the most important matter of all, namely, \nensuring security. For it goes without saying that \nwithout security there can be no development. \nTake the example of my country, which is proud \nof having been a haven of peace and stability for \ndecades. To the east, since March 2013, the Central \nAfrican Republic has seen its security situation \nseverely deteriorate: massacres and population \n\ndisplacements have jeopardized any hope of \ndevelopment, not to mention the flux of tens of \nthousands of refugees towards Cameroon. In the \nfar north, attacks by the Boko Haram group, which \nis more concerned about imposing shariah law than \nimproving the living conditions of populations, \nthreaten the integrity of our territory. There, too, the \nlack of security has caused thousands of displaced \npersons to flee to my country. It is estimated that \nin recent months Cameroon has hosted more than \n200,000 refugees from all kinds of origins. It goes \nwithout saying that my country will continue to \nhonour its tradition of hospitality. However, if that \nsituation should continue, there is no guarantee that \nwe will have the resources to deal with it.\n\u201cThe time allocated to me does not allow \nme to mention the other areas of tension and \nconflict, whether in Africa, the Middle East or \nEastern Europe. The causes and issues are varied. \nI will therefore limit myself to urging the parties \nconcerned to negotiate and to seek peaceful \nsolutions.\n\u201cThat is the path that Nigeria and Cameroon \nchose to settle the dispute between them, some \nyears ago, over the Bakassi peninsula. It enabled \nus to find a solution conforming with international \nlaw and, above all, to seal an unfailing friendship \nbetween our two countries. Moreover it was, I \nshould stress, in harmony with the ideals of the \nCharter of our Organization.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "I bring the Assembly \ngreetings from Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen \nJohnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, \nwho should have been here today to address the \nAssembly but chose to remain on the front lines in \nLiberia to lead our fight against the deadly Ebola virus \ndisease.\n\nLiberia congratulates the President of the Assembly \non his assumption of his high office and acknowledges \nthe astute statesmanship and wisdom that he brings to \nthat important assignment, which inspire confidence \nfor a successful sixty-ninth session of the Assembly. We \nassure him of Liberia\u2019s full cooperation and support. \nWe pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his able and visionary stewardship of the \naffairs of this global institution.\n\nWith just one year until the expiration date of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the theme \nof this sixty-ninth general debate, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d, could not have been more appropriate. Liberia \nwas put on the pedestal of global honour when President \nJohnson-Sirleaf was selected as one of three co-chairs \nof the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda, formed by the Secretary-\nGeneral in 2012 to advise him on the contours of an \nambitious but realistic post-2015 global development \nagenda and to define the critical steps required to \nreinvigorate and sustain global partnership. The Panel\u2019s \nreport, A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and \nTransform Economies through Sustainable Development, \ncontained a clarion call to leave no one behind, which \nhas been embraced as a motivating theme by many.\n\nAt the continental level, our President chairs a \n10-member high-level committee of African Heads \nof State, under whose leadership a African Common \nPosition has been developed and endorsed by the \nmembership of the African Union (AU). That Position \nis based on six pillars that represent Africa\u2019s vision \nof the prerequisites for eradicating poverty on the \ncontinent and for ensuring its future and development. \n\nWe are encouraged that the concepts and strategies \ndefined under each of the pillars have been significantly \nincorporated into the proposed 17 sustainable \ndevelopment goals. That makes us optimistic that the \nsubstance of our pillars will form an integral part of \nthe post-2015 development agenda. As we await the \nSecretary-General\u2019s synthesizing report, I can assure \nthe Assembly of Liberia\u2019s continued active participation \nin the negotiations that lie ahead.\n\nAs we survey the regional and international \npolitical landscape, we are increasingly concerned \nabout the spread of extremist ideologies and terrorist \nactivities around the world, especially in Africa. \nWhether we are speaking of Al-Shabaab in Somalia \nand Kenya, Al-Qaida in the Maghreb or Boko Haram \nin Nigeria, the African continent has not been spared \nthe deadly and destructive consequences of extremism. \nAdditionally, over the past year, while peace processes \nwere being consolidated in many African countries, we \nhave been sad witnesses to the eruption or exacerbation \nof conflicts on the continent, notably in South Sudan \nand the Central African Republic. We laud the efforts \nof the AU and the United Nations to resolve those \nconflicts, and join in the call for sustained international \naction to bring about a more secure and peaceful world.\n\nLiberia commends the Secretary-General for his \nconvening, last week, of the high-level Climate Summit, \nwhich elicited concrete commitments from the global \ncommunity on reducing greenhouse emissions and other \nmeasures aimed at achieving sustainable development. \nAs a small country and one that is still endowed with \n43 per cent of the remaining Guinea forests, we are proud \nthat we too have concluded partnership agreements and \nmade concrete commitments aimed at supporting the \ngoals of sustainable, climate-sensitive development. \nSmall countries like Liberia contribute less to \ngreenhouse emissions but suffer disproportionately \nfrom the adverse impact of climate change. To right that \nanomaly and in the united spirit of saving our one world, \nall countries, big and small, should make proportionate \ncommitments to saving our planet and take concrete \naction to make such commitments a reality.\n\nA year ago, when President Johnson-Sirleaf \naddressed the Assembly (see A/68/PV.6), it was with \na more positive message from a President reporting \nsignificant achievements and lofty aspirations for the \nfuture. President Johnson-Sirleaf, full of gratitude, \ninformed the world that Liberia had just celebrated \n10 years of peace in August 2013, and that, despite some \nchallenges, was still registering remarkable progress on \nthe path of socioeconomic development. The country \nhad transitioned from an emphasis on stabilization to \na focus on transformation within the framework of \na long-term development agenda, Vision 2030. The \nPresident also informed the Assembly that the countries \nof the Mano River Basin Union \u2014 Liberia, Guinea, \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone \u2014 were at peace and \nwere pursuing regional integration through initiatives \nthat would facilitate connectivity within their power \nand transport systems, thereby enhancing the cross-\nborder trade in which our market women are mostly \nengaged. She even reported on how a small contingent \nof Liberian peacekeepers, who are still in Mali \ntoday, had contributed to the laudable United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts there, creating an environment \nconducive to stability and democratic transition in that \ncountry.\n\nOne year later, as I address the Assembly, I am the \npurveyor of a different kind of story, and a sad one. Over \nthe past six months, a dark cloud has been hanging over \nthe Liberian landscape, such that instead of reporting \neconomic growth, we are constrained to report economic \ndecline. The implementation of virtually all the pillars \nof our Agenda for Transformation has been placed on \nhold, and gains are perhaps already being reversed. \nInstead of devoting attention to regional integration \nthrough the facilitation of power and transport projects, \nwe are talking about regional cooperation in dealing \nwith a deadly enemy. The market women who traded \ngoods and services across borders a year ago are now \nconstrained to remain within those borders and suffer \nthe consequences of economic inactivity.\n\nThe deadly enemy that has visited so much harm \nand misery on my country and our neighbours is the \nEbola virus disease, which began wreaking havoc in \nLiberia in March. Since the outbreak, the Government of \nLiberia has taken a host of measures. We have declared \na state of emergency and suspended schools, and, \nwith the constructive involvement of all stakeholders, \nincluding pastors, imams, chiefs, elders, young people, \nGovernment officials and opposition politicians, we \nhave stepped up awareness and prevention campaigns \nto address the rigid denial and deeply rooted traditional \nand cultural practices that create fertile ground for the \nspread of the disease. We have also committed and will \ncontinue to commit significant portions of our own \npaltry resources to the fight.\n\nIn spite of such efforts, which have been buttressed by \nthose of our partners, Ebola has confounded all of us and \nhas sprinted faster than our collective efforts, snuffing \nout the life candle of more than 1,800 of our compatriots, \nwith a total of nearly 3,500 infected. Cumulatively, \nwomen, as the majority among our health workforce and \nthe main caregivers in our deeply traditional society, \nhave been disproportionately affected. Sadly, as Ebola \nwidens its deadly circumference, it is creating a trail of \ntraumatized orphans across the country, which includes \na 10-year-old child from Barkedu, Lofa county, who \nis the last person standing from a family of 12. Our \nalready limited pool of health workers has been further \nreduced, because 89 of them have fallen victim to the \nvirus, out of a total of 182 infected.\n\nThe resulting panic that has arisen in health workers \nwho see their colleagues die from Ebola has precipitated \nthe closure of many health facilities across the country. \nAs we and our many international partners struggle to \ndouse the wildfire caused by Ebola, we are left with \ninadequate resources, time and personnel to attend to \nroutine illnesses such as malaria, typhoid fever and \nmeasles, thereby causing many more, tangential deaths. \nAn increasing number of pregnant women are dying in \nthe process of bringing forth life. In short, our public \nhealth system, which totally collapsed during our \nyears of conflict and was being gradually rebuilt, has \ncollapsed again under the weight of the deadly virus.\n\nEbola is not just a health crisis; it is a total crisis. It is \nan economic crisis, a social crisis and a potential political \nand security crisis. Indeed, its deleterious impact has \nbeen very wide and very deep. On the economic front, \nit has occasioned a 3.4 per cent downward slide in \neconomic growth in Liberia, and some experts have \npredicted that, if not contained quickly, it could cause a \n12 per cent decline in our economy in 2015. As a result \nof the slowdown in economic activities, our revenue \ngeneration capacity has been seriously undermined, \nthereby constricting our ability to provide basic social \nservices and to continue to fund key development \nprojects. The suspension of flights as well as the travel \nand other restrictions and sanctions imposed on Liberia \nand other affected countries despite expert advice to \nthe contrary from the World Health Organization and \nothers, have not only undermined the humanitarian \nefforts aimed at quickly containing the disease, but \nhave also aggravated the adverse economic effects of \nthe Ebola crisis.\n\nAs destructive as the Liberian civil conflict was, at \nleast our people knew the warring factions and the front \nlines. With Ebola, the enemy is more insidious, and \nthere are no clear-cut front lines, because someone\u2019s \nchild, someone\u2019s husband or someone\u2019s workmate \ncould actually be the enemy and in the front line at the \nsame time. That difficult feature of the disease, coupled \nwith a host of other challenges, has occasioned its rapid \nspread. We are heartened that, as a result of separate \nand joint appeals of the heads of State of Liberia, Sierra \nLeone and Guinea to the Secretary-General and leaders \nof friendly countries and institutions, the international \ncommunity is showing a better appreciation of the \nunprecedented scope and magnitude of the Ebola \noutbreak in our countries. There is a chorus of leaders \nadvocating and committing to support more robust, \nscaled up and urgent assistance to the affected countries.\n\nThanks to the Secretary-General and other \nworld leaders, the past few weeks have witnessed a \nhost of positive developments that constitute a major \nheightening of focus and scaling up of the international \nresponse. Those developments include the following.\n\nFirst, we welcome the announcement by President \nBarak Obama of the United States of his Government\u2019s \ndecision to scale up assistance to the region, including \nthe deployment of 3,000 military and medical personnel \nto help us with the fight.\n\nSecondly, the Security Council meeting held on \n18 September 2014 (see S/PV.7268), under the leadership \nand Council presidency of the United States, adopted \nresolution 2177 (2014), which recognizes the Ebola \ncrisis as a threat to international peace and security, \nnecessitating a strong and concerted international \nresponse through firm commitments of support. The \nresolution also called on Member States to lift travel \nand other restrictions imposed on affected countries.\n\nThirdly, the Secretary-General announced on \n18 September his intention to establish the United \nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, which \nwas formally endorsed by Assembly resolution 69/1, \nsubmitted by the President and adopted on 19 September.\n\nFourthly, we have seen the start of the deployment \nby the African Union of contingents of medical and \nrelevant personnel drawn from across Africa to Liberia \nand other worst-affected countries.\n\nFifthly, the high-level meeting on response to the \nEbola virus disease outbreak, convened at Headquarters \n\nby the Secretary-General on 25 September, witnessed \nannouncements of substantial commitments of \nassistance by many countries.\n\nThose concrete demonstrations of solidarity have \ntaken many forms, and we are deeply grateful for all \nof them. They should, however, not lead us towards \ncomplacency, because we definitely have not yet \nachieved the 20-fold increase in response recommended \nby the experts to contain the disease. Additionally, \nwhile we struggle with the first war, which involves \nactually disrupting the transmission of Ebola, we must \nbegin to prepare for the second war of tackling the \nlong-term socioeconomic impacts of the Ebola crisis, \nincluding building and creating the capacity for a new \nhealth system that can robustly deal with any future \nhealth challenge, and raising the resources needed to \naddress a legion of socioeconomic, political, security \nand other challenges made more acute by the presence \nof Ebola.\n\nWe are also cognizant of the positive contributions \nof the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), \nwhich has helped us enjoy 10 years of peace. The \npresence of UNMIL in Liberia, especially at a time when \nwe were experiencing isolation, has helped to reassure \nour people and create a security climate conducive to \ntackling some of the multifaceted challenges of the \nEbola crisis. Therefore, the continued engagement \nof UNMIL in Liberia will be critical to enabling \nLiberia\u2019s transition from the Ebola crisis to resume the \nimplementation of strategies for the achievement of our \nlong-term development agenda.\n\nEbola is a difficult enemy that has frustrated and \nbypassed our collective efforts in the past, causing some \nexperts to project that, in a worst case scenario, about \n1.4 million precious lives could be lost in our countries \nby January 2015. In spite of the gloom of today \u2014 and \nas Liberians ponder the question: \u201cWill I, my wife, my \nhusband, my child, my friend or my workmate be one of \nthose to populate the 1.4 million doomsday statistics?\u201d\u2014 \nwe should not sink into defeatism. Instead, President \nEllen Johnson-Sirleaf and the resilient Liberian people \nfeel that Ebola has presented us with a one-option, \nmultiple-choice test, and that option is to fight back. \nAnd we are fighting back.\n\nAs President Johnson-Sirleaf aptly put it in her \n17 September update to the people of Liberia on the \nEbola crisis:\n\n\u201cI believe in the Liberian people. I believe that \nwe are stronger than the greatest threat with which \nwe are currently faced. And 1 believe we will \nprevail. The war did not defeat us, a completely \ndestroyed economy \u2014 the greatest collapse since \nWorld War II \u2014 did not defeat us. Ebola will not \ndefeat us\u201d.\nWe know that the road ahead may be long, curvy \nand hilly. But with bigger, bolder, timely and sustained \nefforts on our part, buttressed by the international \ncommunity, we are sure that dawn will soon break on \nthis long, dark night occasioned by the Ebola virus.\n"

I congratulate the President of the Assembly \non his unanimous election and wish to express our deep \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ncommitment and dedication.\n\nWe commend the Secretary-General for convening \nthe Climate Summit. The momentum generated at the \nSummit should pave the way next year for a binding \nagreement on climate change, with long-term and \ncomprehensive global commitments for climate \nsolutions based on the principles of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities, equity and respective \ncapabilities. It is an irony that the world\u2019s most \nvulnerable countries happen to be the worst victims \nof climate change through no fault of their own. There \nshould be special provisions for climate financing, \nseparate from regular official development assistance, \nso that the mitigation and adaptation needs of the least \ndeveloped countries and small island developing States \ncan be addressed.\n\nTerrorism is anathema to humankind. It is a \nserious threat to peace, security and development. \nNepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations. We share the concern \nabout the growing scourges of terrorism, extremism \nand religious fundamentalism. In that context, we \nwelcome the convening of the Security Council summit \nmeeting earlier this week (see S/PV.7272) and support \nthe adoption of resolution 2178 (2014), on foreign \nterrorist fighters. We appeal for an early conclusion of \na comprehensive convention on international terrorism \nand the effective implementation of the provisions of \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \nNepal believes that terrorism can best be tackled under \nthe auspices of the United Nations with a coordinated \nglobal response.\n\nPeacekeeping has emerged as the central activity \nof the United Nations and an innovative tool for \ndealing with challenges to peace and security. Nepal \nis proud to have contributed to the maintenance of \n\ninternational peace and security through United \nNations peacekeeping operations in troubled parts \nof the world. Nepalese Blue Helmets have been \ncommended for their professionalism and commitment \nin trying circumstances. We are currently the fifth-\nlargest troop contributor to that flagship activity. With \never-greater commitment and dedication, Nepal will \ncontinue to participate in peacekeeping operations \nand to promote gender equality through the increased \nparticipation of women in peacekeeping. We urge this \nworld body to give due consideration to the safety and \nsecurity of peacekeepers. Nepal calls for equitable \nleadership opportunities, commensurate with Member \nStates\u2019 troop contributions, to be made available both at \nHeadquarters and in the field.\n\nNepal stands for general and complete disarmament, \ncovering all weapons of mass destruction, in a \ntime-bound, verifiable and effective manner. We \ncall upon Member States, especially nuclear-weapon \nStates, to halt militarization in all spheres and step up \nmeasures for disarmament in order to free up much-\nneeded dividends for development. We wish to see an \nenlarged role for the United Nations Regional Centre \nfor Peace and Disarmament in Asia, which is based in \nKathmandu.\n\nAs a least developed and landlocked country, Nepal \nfaces structural constraints and pervasive and complex \ndevelopment challenges. My delegation underlines the \nurgency of addressing the special needs of the least \ndeveloped countries (LDCs) and supporting them \nwith the provision of enhanced resources for inclusive \ndevelopment.\n\nNepal calls upon the international community, \nparticularly donors, to fulfil all the commitments made \nin favour of LDCs. We underline the timely, full and \neffective implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \nAction for LDCs. Nepal aims to graduate from LDC \nstatus by 2022. An enhanced level of international \nsupport to build our productive capacity, improve supply-\nside capacity, minimize shocks and vulnerabilities and, \nabove all, bring about structural transformation will be \ncritical to meeting that target.\n\nNepal remains fully committed to the protection \nand promotion of human rights and has put the \nrequired institutional mechanisms in place. We remain \nconstructively engaged with all United Nations human \nrights mechanisms and the international community \nin the protection and promotion of human rights. We \nreject politicization and selectivity in the application of \nhuman rights standards.\n\nMy Government is determined to bring about a \ndignified closure of the past dating back to the armed \nconflict. We believe the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission and the Commission on Disappearances \nwill help put our past behind us and prevent a \nrecurrence of grave violations of human rights. I want \nto reassure the international community that there will \nbe no blanket amnesty for grave crimes. We underline \nthe need to ensure the rights and well-being of migrant \nworkers.\n\nNepal has always supported the call for a just, \nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East \nand an end to the spiralling conflict in the region. \nWe recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian \npeople on the basis of United Nations resolutions and \nencourage Israel and Palestine to live as neighbours \nwithin secure and recognized international boundaries.\n\nThe situation in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria \ndemands a more proactive United Nations engagement. \nWhile supporting the independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of those countries, we urge the \nUnited Nations to play an active role in finding a political \nsettlement and helping those countries move towards \nnational unity, reconciliation and reconstruction.\n\nWe hold the view that the people of Ukraine should \nenjoy the right to freely decide their destiny without \nany outside interference.\n\nOur unwavering faith and long struggle for a \ndemocratic system of governance has given us the \nstrength to mainstream the armed Maoist rebels into \na peaceful democratic process and lead a successful \ntransition from autocratic monarchy to democratic \nrepublican order, thereby setting up unique models. The \npolitical parties in Nepal, including the Maoists, are \nnow working together to have a democratic Constitution \npromulgated through the elected Constituent Assembly. \nMy Government remains committed to bringing the \nparties both within and outside the Assembly on board \nwithin the framework of constitutionalism, political \npluralism and the rule of law, to put the country on the \npath of peace, stability, development and a democratic \nsystem of governance.\n\nWe greatly appreciate our neighbours, India \nand China, the United Nations, our friends and well-\nwishers in the international community for their \n\n\nsupport for and solidarity with our peace process and \ndevelopment efforts. We firmly believe that democracy \nis indispensable for peace, progress, stability and \nprosperity. Peace, democracy and sustainable \ndevelopment are inextricably linked and mutually \nreinforcing. Development is not possible in the absence \nof peace, which, in turn, cannot be attained in the \nabsence of democracy.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda becomes truly \ntransformative only when the pressing needs and \npriorities of the most vulnerable and marginalized \ncountries and societies are faithfully integrated into the \nbroader global agenda and are provided with sufficient \nresources to achieve them. A holistic development \nprocess does not leave an unfinished agenda behind, \nso the remaining tasks of the Millennium Development \nGoals should be fully incorporated in the post-2015 \nagenda.\n\nWe consider corruption to be the biggest enemy \nof the people and a threat to peace, stability and \ndevelopment. My Government has underlined the \nimportance of transparency, accountability and zero \ntolerance for corruption as prerequisites to improving \nthe quality of governance and delivering results to the \npeople.\n\nNepal\u2019s foreign policy is inspired by the purposes \nand principles of the United Nations. People\u2019s aspirations \nfor peace, stability, progress, decency, dignity and \nprosperity are firmly embedded in it. We strongly \nbelieve that peaceful coexistence, mutual respect \nfor each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States, \nand equality and mutual benefit should constitute the \nfundamental tenets of inter-State relationships.\n\nReforms of the United Nations, including the \nSecurity Council, need to reflect contemporary realities \nfor making it more effective, representative, responsive \nand capable of handling increasingly complex global \nproblems. We support the expansion of membership \nin both permanent and non-permanent categories. The \nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations, next \nyear, should be an occasion to ensure the representation \nand increase the voices of developing countries in the \nSecurity Council. In that context, Nepal reiterates its \nsupport for the desire of India, Japan, Germany and \nBrazil to serve as permanent members in the expanded \nSecurity Council. We also believe that the African \ncontinent and Member States that have contributed to \nthe maintenance of international peace and security \nshould also be given due consideration in any expansion.\n\nIn seven decades of the United Nations, it has been \nfound to be most successful when we honour the letter \nand spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe decisions we make. B.P. Koirala, the first elected \nPrime Minister of Nepal, while addressing the General \nAssembly at its fifteenth session, in 1960, said,\n\n\u201cThe real solution of the world\u2019s problems, \nincluding the problem of world peace and prosperity, \nlies in the direction of strengthening and extending \nthe authority of the United Nations. This authority \nwill be strengthened and fortified if the decisions \nof the United Nations are respected faithfully and \nloyally by all Powers, great and small.\u201d (A/PV.878, \npara. 235)\nIn conclusion, my Government reiterates its \nprofound commitment to the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations as the embodiment of \npeace, progress and prosperity.\n"

He assures the President of his \ncloseness and prayers for the Assembly\u2019s work during \nthis session with the hope that it will be carried out in \nan atmosphere of productive collaboration, working for \na more fraternal and united world by identifying ways \nto resolve the serious problems that beset the whole \nhuman family today.\n\nIn continuity with his predecessors, Pope Francis \nrecently reiterated the Holy See\u2019s esteem and \n\nappreciation for the United Nations as an indispensable \nmeans of building an authentic family of peoples. The \nHoly See values the efforts of this institution to ensure \nworld peace, respect for human dignity, the protection \nof persons, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, \nand harmonious economic and social development.\n\nAlthough mindful of the human person\u2019s gifts and \nabilities, Pope Francis observes that today there is the \ndanger of widespread indifference. To the extent that \nindifference concerns the field of politics, it also affects \neconomic and social sectors, since an important part \nof humanity does not share in the benefits of progress \nand is in fact relegated to the status of second-class \ncitizens. At times, such apathy is synonymous with \nirresponsibility.\n\nI also recall the words of His Holiness to the \nSecretary-General at the beginning of August: \u201cIt is with \na heavy and anguished heart that I have been following \nthe dramatic events in northern Iraq\u201d. He was thinking \nof the tears, the suffering and the heartfelt cries of \ndespair of Christians and other religious minorities of \nthat beloved land. In that same letter the Pope renewed \nhis urgent appeal to the international community to \ntake action to end the humanitarian tragedy now under \nway. He further encouraged all the competent organs \nof the United Nations, in particular those responsible \nfor security, peace, humanitarian law and assistance to \nrefugees, to continue their efforts in accordance with \nthe Preamble and relevant Articles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nToday, I am compelled to repeat the heartfelt appeal \nof His Holiness and to propose to the General Assembly \nand to the other competent organs of the United Nations \nthat they deepen their understanding of the difficult \nand complex time in which we are now living.\n\nWith the dramatic situation in northern Iraq \nand some parts of Syria, we are seeing a totally new \nphenomenon \u2014 the existence of a terrorist organization \nthat threatens all States, vowing to dissolve them \nand to replace them with a pseudo-religious world \ngovernment. Unfortunately, as the Holy Father recently \nsaid, even today there are those who would presume to \nwield power by coercing consciences and taking lives, \npersecuting and murdering in the name of God. Those \nactions bring injury to entire ethnic groups, populations \nand ancient cultures. It must be remembered that \nsuch violence is borne out of a disregard for God and \nfalsifies religion itself, since religion aims instead at \nreconciling men and women with God, at illuminating \nand purifying consciences and at making it clear that \neach human being is the image of the Creator.\n\nIn a world of global communications, that new \nphenomenon has found followers in numerous places \nand has succeeded in attracting from around the \nworld young people who are often disillusioned by \nwidespread indifference and a dearth of values in \nwealthier societies. That challenge, in all its tragic \naspects, should compel the international community \nto promote a unified response, based on solid juridical \ncriteria and a collective willingness to cooperate for the \ncommon good.\n\nTo that end, the Holy See considers it useful to focus \nattention on two major areas. The first is to address \nthe cultural and political origins of contemporary \nchallenges, acknowledging the need for innovative \nstrategies to confront those international problems in \nwhich cultural factors play a fundamental role. The \nsecond area for consideration is further study of the \neffectiveness of international law today, namely, its \nsuccessful implementation by those mechanisms used \nby the United Nations to prevent war, stop aggressors, \nprotect populations and help victims.\n\nFollowing the attacks of 9/11, when the world woke \nup to the reality of a new form of terrorism, some media \nand think tanks oversimplified the tragic moment by \ninterpreting all subsequent and problematic situations \nin terms of a clash of civilizations. That view ignored \nlong-standing and profound experiences of good \nrelations between cultures, ethnic groups and religions \nand interpreted other complex situations through that \nlens, situations such as the Middle East question and \ncivil conflicts occurring elsewhere.\n\nWhat, then, are the paths open to us?\n\nFirst and foremost, there is the path of promoting \ndialogue and understanding among cultures, which is \nimplicit in the Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. That path must become an ever more \nexplicit objective of the international community and of \nGovernments if we are truly committed to peace in the \nworld. The natural growth and enrichment of culture \nis the fruit of all components of civil society working \ntogether. International organizations and States have \nthe task of promoting and supporting, in a decisive \nway and with the necessary financial means, those \ninitiatives and movements that promote dialogue and \nunderstanding among cultures, religions and peoples. \n\nPeace, after all, is not the fruit of a balance of powers, \nbut rather the result of justice at every level and, most \nimportantly, is the shared responsibility of individuals, \ncivil institutions and Governments.\n\nAnd yet, we do not face the challenges of terrorism \nand violence with cultural openness alone. The \nimportant path of international law is also available \nto us. The situation today requires a more incisive \nunderstanding of international law, with particular \nattention to the responsibility to protect. One of the \ncharacteristics of the recent terrorist phenomenon is \nthat it disregards the existence of the State and, in fact, \nthe entire international order. Terrorism aims not only \nto bring change to Governments, to damage economic \nstructures or simply to commit common crimes, it \nseeks also to directly control areas within one or more \nStates and to impose its own laws, which are distinct \nand opposed to those of the sovereign State. It also \nundermines and rejects all existing juridical systems, \nin an attempt to impose dominion over consciences and \ncomplete control over persons.\n\nThe global nature of this phenomenon, which \nknows no borders, is precisely why the framework of \ninternational law offers the only viable way of dealing \nwith this urgent challenge. This reality requires a \nrenewed United Nations that undertakes to foster and \npreserve peace.\n\nGiven that the new forms of terrorism are \ntransnational, they no longer fall under the competence \nof the security forces of any one State. The territories \nof several States are involved. Therefore, the combined \nforces of a number of nations will be required to \nguarantee the defence of unarmed citizens. Since \nthere is no juridical norm justifying unilateral policing \nactions beyond one\u2019s own borders, there is no doubt that \nthat area of competence lies with the Security Council.\n\nMy delegation wishes to recall that it is both licit and \nurgent to stop aggression through multilateral action \nand a proportionate use of force. As the representative \nbody of a worldwide religious community that embraces \ndifferent nations, cultures and ethnicities, the Holy See \nearnestly hopes that the international community will \nassume responsibility in considering the best means to \nstop all aggression and prevent the perpetration of new \nand even graver injustices.\n\nIt is paramount that there be a unity of action for \nthe common good, while avoiding the crossfire of \nvetoes. As His Holiness wrote to the Secretary-General \non 9 August,\n\n\u201cthe most basic understanding of human dignity \ncompels the international community, particularly \nthrough the norms and mechanisms of international \nlaw, to do all that it can to stop and to prevent \nfurther systematic violence against ethnic and \nreligious minorities\u201d.\nWhile the concept of the responsibility to protect is \nimplicit in the constitutional principles of the Charter of \nthe United Nations and of humanitarian law, it does not \nspecifically favour a recourse to arms; it asserts, rather, \nthe responsibility of the entire international community, \nin a spirit of solidarity, to confront heinous crimes such \nas genocide, ethnic cleansing and religiously motivated \npersecution. Today, I cannot fail to mention the many \nChristians and ethnic minorities who in recent months \nhave endured atrocious persecution and suffering in \nIraq and Syria.\n\nIn its resolution 68/6, the General Assembly \ndecided that it would at the present session discuss the \npost-2015 development agenda, which would then be \nformally adopted at its seventieth session, in September \n2015. The President aptly chose the main theme of the \npresent session to be \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d. In \na communication to the recent meeting of the Chief \nExecutives of the agencies, funds and programmes of \nthe United Nations, His Holiness requested that future \nobjectives for sustainable development be formulated\n\n\u201cwith generosity and courage, so that they can have \na real impact on the structural causes of poverty and \nhunger, attain more substantial results in protecting \nthe environment, ensure dignified and productive \nlabour for all and provide appropriate protection \nfor the family, which is an essential element \nin sustainable human and social development. \nSpecifically, this involves challenging all forms of \ninjustice and resisting the economy of exclusion, \nthe throwaway culture and the culture of death\u201d.\nIn that regard, the Holy See welcomes the \n17 sustainable development goals proposed by the \nOpen Working Group of the General Assembly on \nSustainable Development Goals, which seek to address \nthe structural causes of poverty by promoting dignified \nlabour for everyone. Equally, the Holy See appreciates \nthat the goals and targets do not, for the most part, \necho wealthy populations\u2019 fears regarding population \n\ngrowth in poorer countries. It also welcomes the fact \nthat the goals and targets do not impose on poorer States \nlifestyles that are typically associated with advanced \neconomies and which tend to show a disregard for \nhuman dignity.\n\nAs stated earlier, the responsibility to protect is \nrelevant to cases of extreme aggressions against human \nrights and cases of serious contempt of humanitarian \nlaw or grave natural catastrophes. In a similar way, \nthere is a need to make legal provision for protecting \npeople against other forms of aggression that are less \nevident but just as serious and real. For example, a \nfinancial system governed only by speculation and the \nmaximization of profits, or one in which individual \npersons are regarded as disposable items in a culture of \nwaste, could be tantamount, in certain circumstances, to \nan offence against human dignity. It follows, therefore, \nthat the United Nations and its Member States have an \nurgent and grave responsibility for the poor and the \nexcluded, mindful always that social and economic \njustice is an essential condition for peace.\n\n\nEach day of the sixty-ninth session of the General \nAssembly, and indeed of its next four sessions, until \nNovember 2018, will bear the sad and painful memory \nof the futile and inhumane tragedy of the First World \nWar \u2014 a senseless slaughter, as Pope Benedict XV \nreferred to it, with its millions of victims and untold \ndestruction. Marking the centenary of the start of the \nconflict, His Holiness Pope Francis expressed his \ndesire that\n\n\u201cthe mistakes of the past are not repeated, that the \nlessons of history are acknowledged, and that the \ncause of peace may always prevail through patient \nand courageous dialogue\u201d.\nIn making my own the sentiments of the Holy \nFather, I fervently hope that they may be shared by all \npresent here. I offer to all members of the Assembly my \nbest wishes in their work. I trust that this session will \nspare no effort to put to an end the clamour of weapons \nthat marks existing conflicts and that it will continue \nto foster the development of the entire human race, in \nparticular the poorest among us.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by \ncongratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I have no doubt that his election at this juncture \nwill bring to the notice of the world some of the \nproblems and opportunities that exist in Africa. Malawi \nand Uganda have enjoyed cordial relations for a long \ntime and my Government and my delegation will do all \nwe can to support him in that very important position.\n\nLet me also take the opportunity to congratulate \nhis predecessor, Ambassador John William Ashe, for \nguiding the work of the sixty-eighth session of the \nGeneral Assembly with skill and pragmatism. I would \nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nthe steady manner in which he continues to guide our \nglobal Organization.\n\nOn 20 May, my country held its first ever tripartite \nelections, which enabled Malawians to choose their \npolitical leadership through a democratic and peaceful \nprocess. The elections ushered me into office as the \nfifth President of the Republic of Malawi. I would \ntherefore like to inform the Assembly that, despite a \nfew challenges, the elections were free, fair, transparent \nand credible. In that vein, let me seize the opportunity \nto thank all the electoral stakeholders, both local and \ninternational, for their dedication to ensuring successful \nelections in my country. Malawi has come out of the \nelection much stronger than before.\n\nOn 6 July, Malawi commemorated the golden \njubilee of its independence. As we commemorate the 50 \nyears of peace, law and order, we have tasked ourselves \nwith taking stock of the development that the country \nhas registered since 1964, as well as the challenges \nthat the country faces today. Much of the country has \nmade some progress in diverse sectors of our national \ndevelopment, but there is still more to be done in order \nto uplift the living standards of the many Malawians \nwho continue to remain below the poverty line. They \ntoo dream of a better future, which is possible only \nif we work with unity of purpose. In a quest to take \ndevelopment to the micro level, my Government \nhas embarked on a journey to transform Malawi so \nas to ensure the delivery of satisfactory services to \nMalawians, especially the poor and the marginalized.\n\nAs the Assembly is aware, Malawi was the chair of \nthe Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) \nfrom August 2013 until August 2014. During our term \nof office, we strove as a region to achieve long-lasting \npeace and stability in our countries. In that vein, let \nme commend my country, Malawi, and the countries of \nMadagascar and South Africa for holding peaceful and \ncredible elections.\n\nThe SADC group has been undertaking a number \nof efforts aimed at ending the cycle of conflicts and \nviolence in the region. In the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo, SADC deployed the Force Intervention \nBrigade, comprising troops from Malawi, South Africa \nand Tanzania, under the auspices of the United Nations \nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, as authorized under Security \nCouncil resolution 2098 (2013). The SADC group, as \nwell as the international community, is pleased with \nthe success achieved in getting the Mouvement du 23 \nmars and other negative forces to leave the country and \nsurrender. In Madagascar, SADC played a crucial role \nin bringing back constitutional normalcy in the country.\n\nIn terms of international peace and security, I \nwould like to inform this gathering that Malawi has \nalways supported the disarmament of all weapons \nof mass destruction. To that end, we have supported \nresolutions in the General Assembly aimed at nuclear \ndisarmament. Over and above that, a couple of months \nago, my country held an in-country workshop to come \nup with mechanisms to implement Security Council \nresolution 1540 (2004) at the national level to prevent \nthe proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological \nweapons and their means of delivery.\n\nOn the same subject, in the Middle East, Malawi \nhas always been disheartened and disappointed by \nthe continuing violence and loss of life and property \nresulting from the conflict between Israel and Palestine. \nThat cannot go on forever. We trust that the two-State \nsolution to the conflict, with Israel and Palestine living \nside by side, in peace and harmony, is the only viable \nway to achieve lasting peace in the region. We encourage \nboth sides to the dispute to renounce violence, exercise \nutmost restraint and employ dialogue as the sure tool to \nreach a political settlement.\n\nAs for the post-2015 development agenda, the choice \nof \u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative \npost-2015 development agenda\u201d as the theme for the \nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly could not \nbe more appropriate. The fight against poverty, hunger \nand inequality constitutes the greatest challenge of our \ntime. The theme further augurs well for the future in \nrelation to the plans and aspirations of the people of \nMalawi.\n\nMalawi appreciates the consultative nature of \nthe process followed in designing the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Let me therefore commend the \nSecretary-General\u2019s initiatives to ensure an inclusive \nprocess that will lead to the post-2015 development \nagenda. With financial and technical support from the \nUnited Nations, more than 50 countries have conducted \nnational consultations, in which people provided input \nand direction on the post-2015 development framework. \nI am pleased that Malawi was one of the countries \nselected for those national consultations. The post-\n2015 development agenda should reflect the needs and \npriorities of the developing world.\n\nIt is important that the next global development \nagenda draw lessons from the successes and challenges \nof the current blueprint being used, namely, the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Rather than \nseeing 2015 as an end point, we must think of it as the \nbeginning of a new era, an era in which we eradicate \nextreme poverty, protect the environment and promote \neconomic opportunity for all. The MDGs have played \nan important role in concentrating our efforts around \nthe common purpose of eradicating poverty. They \nhave raised public awareness about the unacceptable \nlevels of poverty and have helped mobilize action \ntowards a fairer world. The MDGs provided a common \nframework for monitoring progress, highlighting areas \nof achievement as well as challenges.\n\nMalawi is on track for achieving four of the eight \nMDGs, namely, reducing child mortality; combating \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability; and developing a global \npartnership for development. However, we are unlikely \nto meet the other four goals, namely, eradicating \nextreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal \naccess to education; ensuring gender equality and \nthe empowerment of women; and improving maternal \nhealth. Malawi will therefore be proceeding to the post-\n2015 development agenda with unfinished business \nfrom the MDGs.\n\nOne reason why developing countries like Malawi \nhave failed to achieve all of the Millennium Development \nGoals is inadequate resources. Commitments made by \ndevelopment partners have been unpredictable and \nhave often gone unfulfilled. To achieve delivery of the \n\npost-2015 development agenda, the global community \nshould not repeat that mistake. More importantly, \naccountability and transparency, as well as monitoring \nand evaluation mechanisms, should be promoted. \nIt is therefore imperative that, as we move closer to \nwelcoming the new global development agenda, we \nshould all be mindful of the importance of global \npartnership for effective development cooperation. That \nwould ensure the agenda\u2019s successful implementation \nin developing countries.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda should not \nbe seen as a one-size-fits-all global development \nframework. Malawi is looking forward to a framework \nthat is shared, but differentiated enough, where \ndeveloping countries, depending on their special needs \nand unique characteristics, will have flexibility in \nimplementing programmes. My delegation is pleased \nwith the tremendous progress made thus far in defining \nthe post-2015 development agenda. It is in that context \nthat I would like to reiterate and confirm Malawi\u2019s \ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in \nthree interconnected dimensions, namely, economic \ndevelopment, including the end of extreme poverty; \nsocial inclusion; and environmental sustainability.\n\nI am convinced that Member States gathered here \ntoday will own the outcome document of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda and will be committed to its full \nimplementation. It is also encouraging to note that the \nsustainable development goals that emanated from the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals have incorporated the development concerns of \nboth the developed and developing world.\n\nWith respect to Security Council reform, the year \n2015 will mark, as the General Assembly is aware, \nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \nAs such, it will be an occasion for all of us to bring \nnew energy into the Organization and carry out the \nimportant reforms that we have been calling for since \nits inception. For instance, the limited representation \nin the Security Council is a source of great concern, \nparticularly in the light of the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century. Only by expanding the number of \npermanent and non-permanent members of the Council \nand by including developing countries in both categories \nwill we be able to solve some of the legitimacy deficits \nunder which the Council is currently labouring.\n\nIn conclusion, I would submit that the centre of the \npost-2015 development agenda should be to address \nthe plight of hitherto disadvantaged groups, such as \nwomen, girls and persons with disabilities. It is a well-\nknown fact that the ugly face of poverty manifests itself \nthrough women, girls and persons with disabilities. \nIt is sad that Africa, the continent to which Malawi \nbelongs, shares the following worrisome statistics in \nterms of human development. First, its share of global \npoverty is as high as 30 per cent. Secondly, 40 per cent \nof the continent\u2019s children under 5 are stunted in their \ngrowth. Thirdly, Africa\u2019s share of global child mortality \namounts to 50 per cent. Finally, 50 per cent of Africa\u2019s \nchildren are not in school.\n\nI urge that the post-2015 development agenda give \npriority to those challenges for redress. Africa has \nalready spoken clearly about its priorities through the \nCommon African Position on the post-2015 development \nagenda and through the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, \nwhich aspires to achieve a prosperous, peaceful and \nintegrated Africa.\n\nIn that vein, I wish to call on all stakeholders to \njoin the global partnership for effective development \ncooperation principles by implementing and delivering \non a transformative post-2015 development agenda. \nMalawi will use its position as Chair of the Global \nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation to \nhelp realize that cause.\n"

        "file_text": "Exactly one year ago, \non 30 September 2013, I had the unsurpassed glory of \ndelivering my maiden address to the General Assembly \n(see A/68/PV.21), and I used that occasion to pay homage \nto the great architects of world peace who fostered the \nbirth and initial dynamics of our United Nations. In so \ndoing, I used the principles set out in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations as a ready compass to set my course \nas I navigated the issues that occupied the forefront \nof our attention at that time, under the captaincy of \nformer President John Ashe, who successfully piloted \nour Organization of peace through the turbulent seas of \nglobal uncertainty.\n\nThe issues that commanded the attention of the \ninternational community then included global terrorism \nand the tensions in the Middle East and the Korean \npeninsula. Those were compounded by concerns \naround geopolitical conflicts and unresolved trade \nissues, as well as trade and macroeconomic approaches \nthat favoured industrialized countries to the detriment \nof developing nations.\n\nGiven that in nature\u2019s irreversible onward \nmarch, unresolved problems are brought forward and \ncompounded by succeeding problems, this year the \nGeneral Assembly has convened at a time of increased \nturmoil. Since our discussions last September, it is \nundoubtedly the case that dissension and conflict \nhave increased in the Middle East \u2014 the arena \nthat inevitably sets the price for petroleum and its \nassociated products, which are utilized by the peoples \nof the global community, rich or poor. On the other \nhand, the benefits expected from the end of the Cold \nWar, with the potential for normalizing relations on the \nEuropean continent and in lands and regions far distant \nfrom Europe, now seem to be doubtful of fulfilment, \nas signs, tensions and pressures once associated with \nthe Cold War are evolving, bringing about renewed \nconcerns for the international community as a whole.\n\nWhen such tremors emerge, it is much harder for \nsmall States like ours to get the attention of the major \nPowers with regard to the evaluation and discussion \nof our own issues and objectives. Those can be \nsuccessfully resolved only if the dominant members of \nthe international community can relate to them, without \nthe positions and tensions that emphasize allegiance on \nthe part of small Powers to this or that side. That is \nwhy we, from our small corner of the globe, venture to \nexpress the view, in this most significant of international \nforums, that the tensions and the tendencies towards \nwar now emerging should be subordinated to the search \nfor solutions in which the principles and objectives of \nthe Organization, particularly its preference for the \nnegotiated resolution of conflicts, are pursued as far \nas practicable. The escalating conflicts have negative \n\neffects on the access of small States to the attention \nof larger Powers, and therefore they retard the positive \ncontribution of the international community to our own \nconcerns.\n\nIn that connection, we have observed, with a \ncertain disquiet, tendencies in Europe that indicate a \npossible resumption of the Cold War on that continent. \nWe believe that that can only be disadvantageous to \nsmall countries like ours, because in forums such as \nthis we tend to find a return to demands for automatic \ncommitment to one side or the other. As a small country, \nwe have called for negotiations to prevail in the pursuit \nof the rearrangement of continental European relations, \nfollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the \nWarsaw Pact. Despite being a small country far away \nfrom the situation in Europe, we have long had, and \ncontinue to have, an integral relationship with that \ncontinent. It is particularly on that basis that we call for \ndiplomacy to prevail, and we have been gratified to see \nrecent signs indicating that that is likely to be the path \npursued on the European continent.\n\nWe are relieved to see that the contentions in the \nMiddle East, specifically in respect of the Palestine \nissue, have returned to the negotiating table. That is in \nconcert with earlier developments relating to contentions \nbetween the NATO Powers and Iran, as the various \nparties were able to adopt postures of mutual discussion \nand engagement. That has led recently to what seems to \nbe jointly negotiated stances to the extremely complex \nsituation in Syria and to the emergence of the so-called \nIslamic State, which has been spreading disorder and \ncontention in the wider Middle East.\n\nFrom our perspective, we can only express the wish \nthat negotiations and cooperation among the larger \nPowers and between themselves and other Middle \nEast countries continue, even as some members of the \ninternational community felt it necessary to resort to the \nuse of force in the area. We reaffirm, even in the midst \nof great global complexity, our country\u2019s commitment \nto the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n\nWhile many developments in our world hold the \nseeds of our region\u2019s continued marginalization, we also \nwant to accentuate the more positive trends emerging \nin the international community that are leading to the \ncreation of space in our global arena. Consequently, \nSaint Lucia is encouraged by the possibility of \nenhanced flexibility in decision-making being \npermitted to members of the international community \nvia the emergence of large, developing States in such a \nmanner that they are now characterized as increasingly \nsignificant actors in decision-making relating to the \nresolution of global issues.\n\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year, I referred \nto the emergence of institutions such as the Union \nof South American Nations, which includes some \nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \nand to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \nAmerica \u2014 Peoples\u2019 Trade Agreement (ALBA). They \nhave opened up opportunities for assisting our countries \nto meet the Millennium Development Goals, to which \nwe are all committed.\n\nSaint Lucia reiterates its appreciation for the \nwork of ALBA, an institution committed to assisting \ncountries without requiring ideological commitment \nto this or that position but recognizing the priority of \neconomic and social development and preferring the \npeaceful resolution of disputes above all other concerns. \nIn consonance with that posture, we commend the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela for its contribution to \nthe Ebola eradication budget, and Cuba for its dispatch \nof 156 doctors to West Africa to assist in the fight \nagainst the deadly Ebola virus.\n\nSaint Lucia welcomes the initiative by Brazil, \nIndia, China and South Africa, along with Russia, to \nextend and deepen the assistance available to other \ndeveloping countries, thereby widening the scope \nfor their advancement towards the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. Specifically, \nwe would mention the establishment of the New \nDevelopment Bank, which further facilitates the efforts \nof developing countries for economic reconstruction. \nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization and \nthe single-minded immediacy with which it has pursued \ninternational trade liberalization have threatened the \nvery foundations of our economies, particularly in \nagriculture, which has suffered sudden and certain \ndestruction. From our perspective, therefore, another \ndimension has been added to the efforts of small States \nsuch as Saint Lucia to navigate the consequences of \nsudden international economic liberalization and \nglobalization.\n\nIn that context of the emergence of new balances of \neconomic and political power and new flexibilities in \nthe use of diplomacy, including within our hemisphere, \nSaint Lucia once again reiterates its plea for the removal \nof the blockade imposed against the Republic of Cuba. \nMore specifically, my Government calls for the removal \n\n\nof Cuba from the so-called terrorist watch-list. That is a \nresidual effect of the Cold War, which is over.\n\nGiven the scourge of the traffic in narcotics in \nparticular, we call for further cooperation among all \ncountries in the hemisphere and a setting aside of the old \nCold War postures as necessary conditions for balanced \ndevelopment and peace. A specific example of where \nthat applies relates to our efforts in pursuing collective \narrangements and unimpeded cooperation against \nthe menace of the movement of narcotics through the \nCaribbean Sea and their decimating march across the \nmoral, social and economic fabric of our region. The \ndrug barons make no ideological distinctions among \ncountries as they continue to exploit weaknesses \nderiving from outmoded political stances that impede \neffective regional cooperation. As we all know, those \npursuing the sale of narcotics make special efforts \nto attract the youth of our countries, compromising \nthe essential resource base for our future economic \ndevelopment and social stability.\n\nOnce again, I draw the attention of this body \nto Saint Lucia\u2019s firm and consistent belief that the \nhistorical anomalies of the Cold War still in our \ninternational system should not be allowed to inhibit \nthe contribution of countries desirous of participating \nin, and enhancing, the advancement of developing \ncountries simply because there are issues surrounding \ntheir particular status.\n\nIn that connection I would refer, as I did on behalf \nof the Government of Saint Lucia last year, to the \nparticipation of Taiwan in international organizations, \nparticularly those that focus on technical arrangements \nor the resolution of important issues that are of \nvalue to the international system as a whole or to its \nmember States. My country again makes a plea for \nfuller participation by Taiwan, particularly in the \nWorld Health Organization and the International Civil \nAviation Organization. Taiwan has the experience \nof engaging in a technological revolution that has \nenhanced its economic development and the welfare of \nits people, and in many respects that State has become \na viable economic development model for small States. \nHence we believe that the Government and people of \nTaiwan have much to offer developing countries, and so \nwe would support any institutional initiative that would \nallow that country to make a contribution through those \nmechanisms of the United Nations that are devoted \nto solutions to issues of technological, economic and \nsocial development.\n\nI shall now turn to the theme of this year\u2019s \nGeneral Assembly, \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, \nto navigate two issues of paramount importance to \nSaint Lucia as a small island developing State. At \nthis juncture, I must congratulate the President of the \nAssembly and his country, Uganda, on this theme, \nwhich is charged with invaluable significance for \nmy region and for Africa, as we are challenged in \nbuilding an impregnable substratum of economic and \ntechnological self-determination to successfully deal \nwith the development challenges of our times.\n\nFirst, speaking of Africa and the Caribbean region \nin that context, I come to a matter of great historical \nand contemporary concern to the people of Saint Lucia \nand the Caribbean Community as a whole, which I \nadumbrated in my address to this body last year. It is \nthe issue of the need for the metropolitan Powers to \ncome to terms with the manner in which the Caribbean \nStates were historically created and organized and the \nconsequences of that for their standing and situation in \ntoday\u2019s world. Specifically, at their meeting in July 2014, \nthe Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community \ndecided that a case for reparations should be elaborated \nbeyond the relationship between ourselves and the \nrelevant European Governments and that Caribbean \nStates should, in seeking support for that objective, \n\u201cadvance the reparations case during the sitting of the \nUnited Nations General Assembly in 2014\u201d.\n\nI carry out that mandate now on behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of Saint Lucia, who, in \nconcordance with the peoples of other CARICOM \nmember States, seek the award of reparations as a \nspecific way in which those who in centuries past \nheld the reins of power without accountability can \nnow in recompense make a specific contribution to \nthe nation-building programmes of our Governments \nbeyond existing commitments. In that regard, we make \na case for reparations as a matter of principle.\n\nSecondly, Saint Lucia has welcomed the \ndeliberations of the third International Conference on \nSmall Island Developing States, held in Samoa earlier \nthis month, and the efforts made in that regard by the \nUnited Nations. The recent Samoa Pathway conclusions \nhave re-emphasized the persistent and peculiar \nproblems inhibiting the development of small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS). In the words of the recent \nSIDS declaration, there is an insistence that \u201csmall \nisland developing States remain a special case for \n\n\nsustainable development\u201d, without which \u201csuccess will \nremain difficult\u201d. As the Commonwealth Secretariat \nrecently pointed out, research has shown that countries \nmost exposed to preference loss are mainly SIDS, \nsuch as Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, \nJamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. From \nour regional point of view, the Caribbean Community\u2019s \ncontinental States of Belize and Guyana are included \nin that list.\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretariat has also shown \nthat, while the compound annual growth rate of per \ncapita income of SIDS between 1970 and 2000 was \n0.73 per cent, that of the world economy was almost \nthree times higher, at 2.07 per cent; and that, in the \nperiod between 2002 and 2012, SIDS had one of the \nlowest compound annual growth rates, at 1.23 per cent, \nas compared to 4.96 per cent for developing countries, \n4 per cent for least developed countries and 3.23 per \ncent for sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Saint Lucia Government wants the \nrecommendations of the Samoa Conference to be given \nthe international attention that they deserve. That is \ncritical, considering the fact that along with the specific \nproblems that have been identified as continuing to \ninhibit sustainable development, the instability of the \npresent international economic system only serves to \naggravate the precarious position of small States. In \nthat connection, we stress, as we did when addressing \nthe Assembly last year, the importance of assistance \narrangements, including further development of the \nAdaptation Fund so that our countries can cope with \nthe negative effects of sea level rise.\n\nIn view of Saint Lucia\u2019s urgent requirements, \nwe also emphasize assistance for the construction of \nfacilities that can protect our countries against untimely \nnatural disasters due to climate change. Losses from \ndisasters in SIDS continue unabated and continue to \noutstrip our capacity to cope. Over the past decade, \nmany SIDS have lost considerable momentum in their \ndevelopment progress by having to contend with post-\ndisaster rehabilitation and reconstruction costs, which \ninvariably have brought increased debt. The Caribbean \nhas been a particular victim of those events since I \nspoke here last year, and we hope that following the \nrecent Samoa Conference, a certain urgency will be \nattached to the matter.\n\nSaint Lucia would like to reiterate a few points.\n\nFirst, we emphasize the persistent use of diplomacy \nas a prime instrument for the pursuit of normalized \nrelations among all States.\n\nSecond, the rapidly changing nature of international \nrelations mandates the need to subject the United \nNations system to new levels of critical examination, \nwith the central objective of strengthening the internal \nmachinery of our Organization and reforming it to truly \nreflect today\u2019s geopolitical reality.\n\nThird, we must as an international community do \nall within our power to ensure that the Cold War does \nnot resume even though the post-Cold War dividends \nhave not yet materialized for much of humankind. Now \nis an excellent time to divest ourselves of any residual \neffects of the Cold War, such as the blockade imposed \non our sister island of Cuba and to remove Cuba from \nthe so-called terrorist watch list.\n\nFourth, we make a plea for reparations as a matter \nof principle.\n\nFifth, we must take advantage of new, meaningful \nopportunities for cooperation and partnership, not \nonly with traditional partners but also, setting aside \nlong-standing geopolitical contentions, with a range of \nnon-traditional partners, such as Taiwan.\n\nSixth, developed countries should not pursue trade \nand macroeconomic approaches that are detrimental to \nthe well-being of small island developing States.\n\nSeventh, we must determine a clear and effective \nstrategy by which SIDS can translate the outcomes of \nthe Samoa Conference into concrete results \u2014 results \nthat build on existing international commitments and \ninclude the means of implementation to support the \nnational and regional development efforts of SIDS. \nWithout that, the Samoa Conference could be construed, \nin the words of the late Martin Luther King, Jr., \u201cas a \nmeaningless drama on the stage of history ... shrouded \nwith the ugly garments of shame\u201d.\n\nEighth, Saint Lucia stands for freedom, democracy, \nnon-discrimination, sustainable development, poverty \neradication and special and differential treatment for \nSIDS, all of which are important ingredients of our \nmost precious pursuits and aspirations: peace and \nprosperity for our people, the recovery and resilience \nof our Caribbean region and stability and security in \nour world.\n\n\nFinally, it is fitting and opportune that as we ponder \nthe possibilities of \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, \nwe deliberate carefully on the opportunities and \nalternatives to the current world order. We must look \nto our past to understand our present, and we must plan \nour future by analysing our present and applying the \nlessons of our past. It is in that connection that I feel \ncompelled to conclude by inviting careful consideration \nof the words of the late United States President \nWoodrow Wilson, who asserted America\u2019s historical \nleadership and commitment to international democracy \nand freedom in these words: \u201cWe shall fight ... for a \nuniversal dominion of right by such a concert of free \npeoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations\u201d.\n\n"

        "file_text": "The President of the Republic of Benin, His Excellency \nMr. Thomas Boni Yayi, has asked me to deliver this \nmessage to the Assembly on his behalf.\n\nAt the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Sam \nKutesa on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We pay tribute \nto the country of Uganda for its leadership. I would \nalso like to congratulate the outgoing President of the \nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Mr. John Ashe, \nwhose enthusiasm enabled consensus to be reached \non important issues considered during the Assembly\u2019s \nsixty-eighth session. Without a doubt, he successfully \nfulfilled his mandate, laying the groundwork for the \npost-2015 development agenda, in particular with the \nsuccessful conclusion of the work of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals. My gratitude \nalso goes to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his continuing efforts to strengthen the role of the \nUnited Nations as an effective force for stability, peace, \ncollective security and the promotion of human dignity \nand sustainable development. I would like to express to \nhim my firm support for his initiatives aimed at easing \ntensions and settling conflict situations in order to pave \nthe way to building a world that is more just, based on \nequality, justice, respect for human rights and solidarity \namong peoples, and to curb climate change.\n\nThe theme of the current session, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d, is of prime importance for the least developed \ncountries (LDCs), a group for which Benin serves as \nChair through September 2015. It clearly describes the \nmajor work to be done and on which we should focus \nour energies throughout the Assembly\u2019s sixty-ninth \nsession in order to forge consensus around actions to \nbe taken to make \u201cThe future we want\u201d a reality. In \nthat regard, the post-2015 development agenda must \ntake into account the lessons learned and experiences \nacquired throughout the 15 years we have just gone \nthrough in the implementation phase of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Efforts must therefore be pursued \nto eliminate extreme poverty, promote more equal and \ninclusive economic growth, establish transparent and \nresponsible institutions that are able to stimulate the \nprocess of sustainable development, bring about the \nprofessionalization of young people, and create decent \njobs for the long term through the implementation of \nintegrated social protection schemes that cover all forms \nof vulnerability. Once adopted, the implementation \nof the post-2015 development agenda should receive \nstepped up attention and energy so that no one will be \nleft behind. The High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \n\n\n\f\non the Post-2015 Development Agenda have sent the \nSecretary-General their recommendations on the \nprogramme.\n\nThe third International Conference on Financing \nfor Development should be prepared with an open mind \ntowards innovation. In that regard, it is important to \ncreate strategies and find the means to implement them \nin order to accelerate structural transformations in the \nleast developed countries so as to reduce the gap that \nseparates them from developed countries, notably with \nregard to access to the benefits of modernity, and in \norder to meet basic needs, which should now be seen \nas a fundamental right to be guaranteed to all human \nbeings. It is necessary to put an end to exclusion in all \nits forms and at all levels and to integrate all countries \naffected by marginalization into the global economic \ngrowth by re-establishing the balance that has been \ndisrupted among the three dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment, namely, economic efficiency, social \nstability and environmental preservation.\n\nI would like to recall that the Istanbul Action \nProgramme set as a major goal halving the number of \nLDCs by 2020. The Programme made the productive \ncapacity-building of LDCs one of its foremost priorities \nin order to achieve that goal. With a view to mobilizing \nthe international community to implement that effective \nprogramme, in its capacity as Chair of the Global \nCoordination Bureau of the Group of Least Developed \nCountries, Benin took the initiative to organize the \nMinisterial Conference on New Partnerships for \nProductive Capacity-Building in LDCs, held in Cotonou \nfrom 28 to 31 July.\n\nIn its resolution 68/224, of 20 December 2013, \nthe General Assembly expressed its expectations with \nregard to the outcomes of the Ministerial Conference. \nToday, I can report those outcomes to the Assembly. \nThe Ministerial Conference adopted the Cotonou \nAgenda for productive capacity-building in LDCs. It \nadvocated innovative approaches in that area through \nspecific recommendations both for LDCs and for \ntheir development partners. It also requested that the \nGeneral Assembly include on its agenda for the sixty-\nninth session the issue of productive capacity-building \nin LDCs.\n\n\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Benin, \nI would like to thank our partners, in particular, \nTurkey, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain \nand Italy, for their contribution to the success of that \nConference, which is of historic importance to LCDs, \nsince it affects a crucial aspect of their development \nand of their integration into the world economy. I would \nalso like to thank Belgium, co-Chair of the Group of \nFriends of LDCs, and the European Union, which \nassisted in implementing the initiative. The Office \nof the High Representative for the Least Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \nSmall Island Developing States, the United Nations \nOffice for South-South Cooperation, the United \nNations specialized agencies, funds and programmes, \ncivil society and the private sector provided valuable \ntechnical support for the knowledgeable preparation of \nthe Ministerial Conference. The Cotonou Agenda for \nproductive capacity-building in LDCs will clearly be \na road map for promoting the implementation of the \nIstanbul Programme of Action.\n\nIn 2015, we will undertake a comprehensive review \nof the major efforts undertaken and the results achieved \nin all areas targeted by the Millennium Development \nGoals. The most recent performance assessments put \nBenin, my country, among the leading 20 countries \nfor the greatest progress made in absolute terms of \nthe proportion of their population that has emerged \nfrom poverty. Benin, my country, is singled out by the \nintroduction of free kindergaren and primary education \nand the provision of facilities at the secondary and \nhigher education levels for pupils and students in \nneed, thereby allowing a significant increase in school \nenrolment, in particular among girls.\n\nIn the area of health, the actions of my Government \nhave improved the management and provision \nof services for the prevention of mother-to-child \nHIV/AIDS transmission, nutrition, water supply, \nhygiene and sanitation. On the basis of the established \nhealth-care infrastructure network, the Government \nwas able to launch a universal health insurance plan, \nwhich provides a level of social protection to people \nat an affordable cost. The provision by the State of \nCaesarean operations, as well as free health care to \nchildren under 5 years of age, have also been life-saving \nmeasures for thousands of Beninese families. Also, \nefforts have been made by the Government of Benin \nto alleviate poverty by providing substantial support \nto microcredit institutions. That has had a significant \nimpact on improving the living conditions of many \nrural populations.\n\n\n\f\nThe willingness of development partners to \nsupport Benin in its vision for long-term development \nand in underpinning the progress made in the areas of \npolicy and administrative governance, the management \nof social justice and the economic governance was \nstrengthened by the very encouraging results of the \nround table on Financing for Development in Benin, held \nin Paris from 17 to 19 June, with funding commitments \nto the tune of approximately $12 billion over a period \nof five years.\n\nThe facts demonstrate every day that peace, \nsecurity, good governance at the national and the \ninternational levels and the flawless exercise of \nsovereign functions by States are the best guarantees \nfor international peace, security and stability. In that \nregard, it is urgent to strengthen the effectiveness of \nthe United Nations with regard to efforts to ensure \nbetter conflict prevention and to combat injustice and \nthe various forms of criminality rampant in the world. \nIn that connection, with regard to Africa, in general, \nand the Sahel region, in particular, it is necessary to \nimprove the United Nations support mechanism in \norder to prevent further conflict and to promote the \nnecessary stability for the development of the States of \nthe region.\n\nThere is a crucial need to address the root causes of \nconflicts, which, at the global level, are used as a pretext \nfor extremism and terrorist organizations. I would \nlike to welcome the mobilization of the international \ncommunity and the steadfastness of the United Nations \nin response to the actions of those armed groups. Thanks \nto the effectiveness of the actions undertaken, the main \ntheatres of conflict in Africa are seeing an easing of \ntension. Benin will continue to provide its modest but \nquality contribution to United Nations peacekeeping in \nthat regard.\n\nCoastal African States, in particular those in the \nGulf of Guinea, also face piracy and armed robbery \nat sea, as well as transnational organized crime. That \ngreatly hampers their economic growth. The steps \ntaken to address such criminality have clearly produced \nencouraging results. However, we need to further \nstrengthen those steps through the ongoing vigilance \nand greater support of the international community in \norder to rapidly implement the measures adopted on the \nbasis of the outcome of the ministerial meeting held in \nCotonou on 18 and 19 March 2013 and the summit held \nin Yaound\u00e9 on 24 and 25 June 2013 with regard to the \nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 2018 \n(2011) and 2039 (2012).\n\nMoreover, the tranquillity of West African nations \nhas been shaken for some months by the outbreak of the \nEbola virus, whose rapid spread has already caused more \nthan 3,000 deaths, half the number of those infected. \nThe scale of the phenomenon requires the deployment \nof a coordinated health mechanism throughout the \ncountries of the region in order to contain it.\n\nFrom this rostrum, I commend the diligence shown \nby the Secretary-General and by the World Health \nOrganization in leading the international community \nto take measures commensurate with the challenge \nto humankind and to establish a series of emergency \nmeasures to counter and to contain that global threat \nbeyond the affected States. The crisis underscores the \nneed to promote human security and, in particular, \nhealth security in order to increase the resilience of \npopulations.\n\nThe state of the world is undoubtedly taking a very \nworrying turn. Humankind is at a crossroads. It is more \nnecessary than ever that the United Nations affirm its \nleadership so as to reverse the alarming trends. In that \nregard, it is urgent to find a negotiated solution to the \nsituation in the Middle East, which has continued for \ntoo long. Maintaining the status quo is untenable in all \nrespects. The recognition of Palestine as a sovereign \nState and a full Member of the United Nations, living \nin harmony with Israel, cannot be delayed any longer. \nSuch recognition will clearly facilitate the momentum \nfor reducing tensions in the Middle East and establish \nfavourable conditions for a just and lasting settlement \nof the other conflicts and complex problems afflicting \nthat region.\n\nBenin deplores the escalation of violence in Ukraine \nand the radicalization of the parties to the conflict, which \nis leading to increase in the loss of human lives and the \ndamage suffered by the affected civilian populations. \nI would also urge the United Nations to work towards \nthe settlement of that conflict in the higher interest of \ninternational peace and security.\n\nIn addition, Benin advocates for the peaceful \nsettlement of existing disputes in the context of the \nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We call for the \nmobilization of the international community with \nregard to the holding and the success of the next \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \n\n\n\f\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapon, with an African \nChair. We draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the issue \nof the funding for the preparations for the Review \nConference, the responsibility for which cannot rest \nsolely with the upcoming Chair, particularly since that \ncountry is an LDC.\n\nThe universality, indivisibility and interdependence \nof all human rights are fundamental values for Benin. \nWe are strongly committed to human dignity and the \nsacred nature of human life. For that reason, out of a \nnational belief, Benin acceded to the international \ninstrument for the abolition of the death penalty. That \nenables us to join the countries at the forefront of \nthe global campaign for the abolition of that form of \npunishment. We welcome that commitment.\n\nThat campaign must continue so that the idea that \nthe death penalty, far from serving justice, instead \nrepresents a failure of justice is more broadly shared. \nThe increasing number of countries that support the \nmoratorium or have acceded to it by law or in deed \nstrengthens our hope for the universal abolition of \nthe death penalty. In the context of that campaign, the \nGovernment of Benin, in cooperation with the African \nCommission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, organized \na regional conference on the abolition of the death \npenalty in Africa in Cotonou from 2 to 4 July. The \nconference called on African States to abolish the death \npenalty throughout the continent.\n\nMy Government remains committed to strengthening \nthe principles of democracy and the rule of law and the \nimplementation of effective development policies. That \nis why my Government strives daily to find ways and \nmeans of strengthening those norms in Benin, which \nrequires the creation of jobs and opportunities for all. \nThat noble goal can be achieved only by effectively \ncombating corruption.\n\nThe difficult times that the world is currently \nexperiencing require both globally and nationally a \nunited front in support of the values of mutual respect, \nsolidarity, inter-faith dialogue and, in particular, \nongoing talks between Muslim and Christian leaders \nin order to establish a common space of friendship, \nessential to the flourishing of peoples. Taking into \naccount the seriousness of that problem in Africa, my \nGovernment decided to support an initiative of the \nPan-African Social Prospects Centre, headquartered in \nBenin, to hold an international symposium on Islamic-\nChristian dialogue in Cotonou in March 2015. That \nmultifaceted project seeks to promote education on \npeace and development among peoples in the context of \na harmonious coexistence of religions. I encourage all \npeople of goodwill to respect such ideals and to support \nBenin\u2019s initiative.\n\nIn conclusion, I recall the need for intensified \nnegotiations to achieve the reform of the United \nNations, in particular, the Security Council. Benin \nstrongly hopes that in 2015, the seventieth anniversary \nof the Organization will be marked by the adoption \nof significant measures commensurate with the \nchallenges and opportunities of the new era in order to \nmake the composition of the Council fairer and more \nrepresentative and its working methods more inclusive \nso that it can fulfil its mandate more effectively.\n\nMoreover, all our efforts must seek to achieve our \nshared desire to see the United Nations regain its full \ncapacity to promote an inclusive, transparent and more \neffective global governance in the context of productive \nmultilateralism so as to build a balanced world order \nthat promotes stability and harmony to the clear benefit \nof our peoples. In such conditions, all Member States \nwould be able to take the virtuous path of sustainable \ndevelopment and shared prosperity so that equality, \npeace, brotherhood and the effective solidarity of \nnations lead to that better world for which we yearn.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like, first of all, \nto thank the outgoing President, Mr. John Ashe, for \nhis sterling efforts in presiding over the sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly in a year that was \ndedicated to island States around the world. Let me \nalso congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa and welcome him \nas the incoming President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. He can count on Grenada\u2019s \nsupport to contribute to the deliberations in a positive \nand meaningful way.\n\nAs we gather here in New York yet again, we can \ncelebrate the remarkable history of our institution in this \nbeautifully refurbished United Nations Headquarters. \nI wish to put on record Grenada\u2019s appreciation to the \ndonors who contributed and to the Secretary-General \nfor his leadership on this project. With its large open \nspaces and glass fa\u00e7ade, the building\u2019s design speaks \nto our ideals of transparency, openness and dialogue. \nThe building\u2019s mid-twentieth-century features recall \nthe spirit of an age when space was the new frontier.\n\nThe space age has given way to a new and \nexciting information age. Today, a young girl armed \nwith a smartphone in Gujarat, India, can Google the \nsame satellite images of our planet as a child in Great \nBritain. Exposed to the right ideas on the Internet, \nchildren \u2014 whether in Greensboro in the United \nStates, or Grenoble in France, or Grenada in the \nCaribbean \u2014 can have the same seeds of hope, the \nsame aspirations for happiness and personal growth, \nand the same sense of duty towards neighbourhood and \nplanet. For aspiring young people everywhere, coming \nof age is symbolized by ownership, not of a car, but of \n\na mobile phone or a computer tablet. Those are today\u2019s \nvehicles on the information highway for the world\u2019s \nyouth seeking ideas, identity and connectedness.\n\nWe come to the United Nations today to feel that \nsense of connectedness amid the chaos of today\u2019s \nchallenges. We come to these refurbished Headquarters \nto renew our commitment to peace and security and \nto revitalize our mission, not to the stars, but to work \nfor a safer planet with shared prosperity for all. Today, \nin this iconic Hall, it is too soon to say \u201cmission \naccomplished\u201d, but for the most part, our original \nmission for dialogue and the rule of law among abiding \nnations has been accomplished.\n\nSitting here among ourselves, we are, for the most \npart, preaching to the converted. The long-standing \nconflict between Israel and Palestine has given way to a \nrealization that the only viable solution is the two-State \nsolution. Moreover, sworn enemies in this Hall now \nconfer on how to tackle much more sinister enemies \nof peace.\n\nThose new enemies have no flags fluttering \nproudly outside, nor electronic nameplates inside. \nThey are not here in our space-age Hall; they are out \nthere in cyberspace, a place where violence and hate \nin isolated corners can spread like wildfire across the \nglobe. Captured on mobile phones and uploaded to the \nInternet, gruesome images from a remote backstreet \ncan inflict fear in the hearts of ordinary citizens on \nMain Street everywhere.\n\nThe shocking beheadings we see in the media are \nthe weeping ooze from the cancerous underbelly of our \nworld today. They are the symptoms of an insidious and \npervasive unease eating away at the very foundations \non which this great institution was built. And with each \nnew escalation of violence, we feel a sense of horror \nnot only at the acts themselves but perhaps more at our \ninability to act.\n\nWar and insecurity in the information age have \nmutated so much that neither our resolutions, our \nagencies nor our armies are enough to break the fever \nof this viral menace of transnational actors. And so, \nlooking beyond our Capital Master Plan that reimagines \nour twentieth-century beginnings, let us build a new \nInformation Master Plan fit for the twenty-first century \nwith electronic highways that will one day connect this \nHall to every child in every village.\n\nThe information age is a new season in the arc of our \ninstitution\u2019s history \u2014 a new season in which everyone \nhas a voice, be they the youths of the Arab Spring or the \nOccupiers of Wall Street\u2019s winter of discontent. Today\u2019s \ninformation age brings a new transparency between \nthe haves and the have-nots \u2014 between the 1 per cent \nand the 99 per cent. Whether segmented by class, race, \nreligion or political affiliation, inequality is the disease \nof our times, contributing to the political eruptions all \nover the world.\n\nWe now have \u2014 for the first time \u2014 documented \nevidence of the root causes of the growing inequalities \nin society. A new economic treatise, entitled Capital in \nthe Twenty-First Century, by Thomas Piketty, analyses \nover a century of economic data and concludes that \nthe rich are getting richer, faster than everyone else. \nBut there are two things that reduce income inequality. \nThe first is the distribution of knowledge that promotes \ngrowth. The second is war, which destroys capital. The \nfirst option is a rising tide that lifts all ships; the second \nis a sinking stone that drowns all hope \u2014 the very \nantithesis of this Organization.\n\nWe must focus more of our global policy on proactive \ninterventions that promote sustainable growth. We must \nencourage economic growth by distributing knowledge \nthrough education, information and communication \ntechnology, as well as through skills and technology \ntransfers. We do indeed need an Information Master \nPlan if we are to proactively confront threats in the \ntwenty-first century.\n\nThe World Development Report 2011: Conflict, \nSecurity and Development, published by the World Bank, \nacknowledges that development agencies have not yet \nfully adapted to the needs of the twenty-first century \nand that they do not yet have the capacity to adequately \nhelp fragile States. It finds that unemployment is the \nnumber-one reason for youths to join criminal gangs \nand contending armies. It reminds us that investing in \ncitizen security, justice and jobs is essential to reducing \nviolence. We know that once mass violence takes root \nin a society, it can take a generation or more to recover.\n\nAs we look around at the violence in the world \ntoday, I ask the question: can our twentieth-century \ninstitutions cope with twenty-first-century shocks? \nDo we have the courage to be proactive in fostering \njobs and growth, or will we wait until violence erupts? \nThis year\u2019s World Development Report 2014 is all about \nmanaging opportunity and managing risk, from the \nlevel of the household to the level of the international \ncommunity. The essence of the report is that the \n\nbenefits of proactive preparation can outweigh the \ncosts of responding retroactively.\n\nThe risks from climate shocks are among the \nmost terrifying for Grenada and for islands around \nthe world. Grenada places on record its appreciation \nfor the Secretary-General\u2019s leadership in calling for a \nClimate Summit. In the last four years alone, we have \nseen floods raging across the world. With the hottest \ntemperatures on record in recent years, forest fires have \nraged across almost all continents, devouring millions \nof acres of forest land, causing damages in the tens of \nbillions of dollars. Glacial retreats from the Andes to \nthe Himalayas and from Greenland to Antarctica are \nmoving at record speeds. We are seeing hurricanes and \ncyclones as never before.\n\nTwo years ago, right here in New York, Hurricane \nSandy struck and disabled the economic engine of the \nUnited States. It caused $68 billion worth of damage. \nBut this represents less than 1 per cent of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of the United States in contrast \nwith the island States, where damages of between \n10 per cent and 50 per cent of GDP are common, and, in \nthe case of Grenada, where damages occurred totalling \n200 per cent of GDP from Hurricane Ivan alone. Even \nas we speak, this week Grenada was plagued with \nunseasonably high rains that have caused numerous \nlandslides. The value of the damage is yet to be \ndetermined. Like our neighbours Saint Lucia and Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines in 2013, we are forced to \ndedicate already scarce financial resources to repair \nand mitigate this.\n\nThere is a link between these events and the high \nindebtedness of small Caribbean islands. To paraphrase \nthe World Bank\u2019s country assistance strategy for the \nEastern Caribbean, the years when fiscal policy failed \nto explain increases in debt-to-GDP ratios were the \nsame years when natural disasters occurred. Given \nthese risks, island States need concessionary financing. \nThis is critical to ensuring growth, jobs and economic \ndevelopment. For small island developing States (SIDS), \na robust economy, combined with risk-management \npolicies and instruments, is the best combination for \nresilience.\n\nWhen our current Administration was elected \n16 months ago, the indebtedness of our country was \nunsustainable. But the Grenadian people came together \nunder the leadership of Prime Minister Mitchell. \nUnions, churches, non-governmental organizations, \npolitical parties and businesses all rallied to form a \nsocial compact to put Grenada on a firm fiscal footing. \nWe tightened our belts and asked the Grenadian people \nto contribute more as we undertook our home-grown \nfiscal reform. The indebtedness of the SIDS must \nbe counted among the many challenges of our time. \nThe annual cry of the small island States to make \nconcessionary funding available is the early-warning \nsystem for the international community. Let us settle \nthe least developed countries graduation issue in \nfavour of the SIDS, rather than use it as a parallel \nclimate-negotiation tool against the SIDS.\n\nOne country that is singled out for its stellar \nmanagement of disasters is Cuba. We all have much \nto learn from Cuba on areas as diverse as disaster risk \nmanagement and public-health management. Cuba \nsends its engineers, teachers and doctors around the \nworld to improve the lives of others. Is it not time to fully \nrecognize the contributions of Cuba to the international \ncommunity \u2014 and if not now, then when? Is it not time \nto end the Cold War attitudes to Cuba \u2014 and if not now, \nthen when? Is it not time to end the embargo against \nCuba \u2014 and if not now, then when?\n\nThe explosion of violence that we see in today\u2019s \ntrouble spots is driven by the flawed principle of \ndisrespect for international law and the territorial \nintegrity of Member States. There comes a time when \nold enemies must turn swords into ploughshares and \nlook to a future with dignity and with hope.\n\nJust as climate change is the challenge of our time, \nit can also be said that climate change is possibly one \nof the greatest opportunities for wealth creation and \nshared prosperity that this generation has seen. Today, \nthe renewable energy market is estimated to be in \nthe order of $16 trillion, including $12 billion in the \nCaribbean alone. In 2012, there were some 6 million jobs \nin renewable energy and the International Renewable \nEnergy Agency (IRENA) expects 17 million jobs \nby 2030. Today, pension funds with collective assets \nexceeding $12 trillion are focusing on climate risk, \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nIsland States like Grenada are seized not only of \nclimate challenge, but also with climate solutions. For \nus, a robust economy, combined with sound disaster \nrisk-management policies and instruments, is the most \nsustainable form of adaptation to climate change. \nBut in Grenada, we cannot educate our people if our \nschoolchildren have no access to electricity. Due \nto the high import costs of fossil fuels, electricity in \nGrenada costs four to five times higher than it does in \n\n\ndeveloped countries. But countries with low electricity \nprices have to subsidize renewables; not so in the \nislands. Islands like Grenada come to the climate table, \nnot like hapless victims cap-in-hand, but offering the \ninternational community 100 per cent renewables that \ncan be introduced with zero subsidies.\n\nIf we are to limit global carbon dioxide concentrations \nto 450 parts per million, then, according to the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s fifth \nassessment report, our electricity sector needs a total \ntransformation. While island States are the least of the \nemitters, they are the most cost-effective places for \nrenewables. I congratulate the Small Island Developing \nStates Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK), \nIRENA and Sustainable Energy For All for acting on \nthis.\n\nGrenada is working to transform its electricity \nsector. Solving the energy challenge for islands like \nGrenada will remove a drag on our economies and \nbetter position us to withstand environmental shocks. \nThis is adaptation with prospects for jobs, growth and \nshared prosperity for all. I am delighted to announce \nthat, in addition to working with Germany, the World \nBank, SIDS DOCK and IRENA, Grenada has signed \na groundbreaking memorandum of understanding \nwith the United States to assist us in transforming our \nenergy mix, as we announced in Samoa. We have also \nsigned an memorandum of understanding with New \nZealand to help us better understand our geothermal \nresources. Grenada will serve as the pilot country for \nthe regional energy initiative of the United States and \nwill work with New Zealand on geothermal energy. \nWe welcome others to join this partnership and this \nunfolding success story that is Green Grenada.\n\nAs we have said before, we wish to recommend \nthe following actions. Let us operationalize the \nGreen Climate Fund with a window for islands. \nLet us implement 100 per cent renewable energy in \nisland States. Let us put a price on carbon and stop \nsubsidizing fossil fuels. Let us decarbonize food \nsecurity. Agriculture, forestry and other land use \ncontribute 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Let \nus have greater support for climate-smart agriculture \nthat can deliver a triple win of increasing productivity \nand incomes, increasing resilience to climate change, \nand reducing or removing carbon emissions. Grenada \nis pleased to be working with the Government of the \nNetherlands on a climate-smart agricultural alliance \nand on Global Blue Growth and Food Security Initiative.\n\nBlue growth is vital for the economies of island \nStates around the world, and our tri-island State \nof Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique sees \nitself as an Ocean State, given that our exclusive \neconomic zone in the sea is over 70 times larger than \nour land mass. Our tri-island State is pleased to host \nthe secretariat of the Caribbean Challenge Initiative \n(CCI), which is supported by Germany and others. \nThe CCI promotes an enhanced marine environment, \nand Grenada is committed to conserving its near-shore \nmarine environment. Through reports like the Sunken \nBillions, the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization have shown that conservation efforts \nare critical to ensuring maximum economic yield in \nfisheries.\n\nIn the past 30 years, we have lost 30 per cent of our \ncorals and mangroves. This is why Grenada welcomes \nefforts such as the Global Blue Growth Initiative and \nthe Global Partnership for Oceans, and the efforts of \nThe Economist and United States Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry to bring renewed attention to the oceans. We \nlook forward to welcoming our partners to Grenada in \nJanuary 2015 for the launch of the Global Blue Growth \nand Food Security initiatives.\n\nIn closing, Grenada acknowledges the successes \nof the 2014 Third International Conference on Small \nIsland Development States, held in Samoa, and, building \non the momentum of Samoa, we look forward to the \nsuccessful conclusion to the sustainable development \ngoals process leading into the twenty-first session of \nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris \nnext year.\n\nAs we move forward, let us remember that a number \nof the Millennium Development Goals have not been \nachieved. We have a duty, therefore, to re-examine our \napproach to peace, security and shared prosperity. We \nneed collective action on a global consensus. We need \nto act now before it is too late. We must shed the old \nways and adopt twenty-first-century approaches for \nthis millennium generation if we are to bequeath to \nthem and future generations the bounty we inherited \nand the bounty that they deserve.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to address the General Assembly today on behalf \nof the Romanian delegation. At the outset, allow me \nto congratulate the Honourable Sam Kutesa on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-ninth session and to assure him of the full support \nof the Romanian delegation in fulfilling his high \nresponsibility and functions.\n\n(spoke in French)\nAs this is the first time I have had the honour to \nparticipate in this high-level debate, let me reaffirm \nmy country\u2019s peaceful mission as a promoter of peace \nand international security, the values of democracy, \nthe rule of law and respect for human rights. The \nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \nOrganization (A/69/1) over the past year again confirms \nthat cooperation among Member States, based on \nthe principles of the United Nations and in a spirit \nof solidarity, can meet the current challenges of our \npeoples.\n\nI would like to address some issues of interest to \nmy country in regard to developments in international \nrelations. Since the General Assembly\u2019s general debate \na year ago, the area of international security has \nwitnessed the most complex and serious developments \nsince the end of the cold war. In that context, we have \na duty to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of \nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, \nthe non-use of force and the peaceful resolution of \nall problems between States, in accordance with \ninternational law.\n\n(spoke in English)\nOne of the crises of utmost concern to my country \nis the current situation in Ukraine, given its impact \non the security of the countries in Eastern Europe. \nThe crisis started, as the Assembly knows, with the \n\n\nunilateral annexation of Crimea, an integral part of \nthe sovereign State of Ukraine. That action on the \nEuropean continent, unprecedented in recent decades, \nwas followed by an internal conflict in the eastern \nregions of Ukraine, generated by forces pursuing \nseparatist goals. I wish to reconfirm our clear and firm \nnational position on the crisis in Ukraine. Romania \nrejects any form of external pressure on States in \nEastern Europe with aspirations to achieve integration \nwith Europe. Romania firmly supports the territorial \nintegrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and all countries. \nA strong, united and sovereign Ukraine, committed to \nits European path and to reforms in the economic and \npolitical fields, is in the best interests of Europe and the \nwhole world.\n\nThe international community has been involved in \nfinding a solution to the crisis from its beginning. We \ncommend the United Nations for its constant presence in \nthe field and the efforts of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe to monitor the day-by-day \ndevelopments on the ground and to support the whole \ninternational effort through its specific mechanisms.\n\nFor many years, all countries of Eastern Europe \nand the Black Sea region have shared and openly \ndeclared the common goals of peace and cooperation. \nBut instability and grave security concerns, such as in \nUkraine, in Transdnistria, Ossetia and Abkhazia, and \nnow in Donetsk, continue to pose obstacles to those \ngoals. We must condemn aggression. We should not \nlose trust in the rule of international law. We should \nnot lose faith in the benefits of cooperation, and we \nshould all strive to prevent a spillover of the current \ncrisis. The region has always been a bridge between \nCentral Asia and Europe. At this juncture, we have \na historical responsibility to assume, protect and \npreserve the potential for collaboration, cooperation \nand development in that part of Europe.\n\nSituated at the crossroads of the Danube and Black \nSea regions, as well as serving as a bridge between \nNorthern Europe and the Balkans, Romania is fully \naware that regional cooperation is key for ensuring \nregional stability, for building confidence and for \npromoting the universal principles and values of the \nCharter of the United Nations. Joint initiatives on the \neconomy, environment, infrastructure and cross-border \ncooperation have a long-term impact on all countries in \nour region. As a European Union member, Romania is \nan active contributor to the European Union Strategy \nfor the Danube Region, to the Black Sea Synergy and to \nthe South-East European Cooperation Process.\n\nWe praise the solidarity expressed by the European \nUnion and transatlantic partners in supporting a \nsustainable path for democracy and development in the \nRepublic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia, assisting \nthem to freely achieve their European aspirations. \nIt was 75 years ago, based on the infamous Molotov-\nRibbentrop Pact, that parts of Romania and some other \nindependent States were dismantled. We have learned \nthat history must not be an excuse for justifying actions \nagainst other countries. On the contrary, our answer to \nany temptation based on past history is strong support \nfor democratic development, respect for the right to \ndemocratically choose one\u2019s future, and respect for \ninternational law.\n\nI want to state that position clearly, on behalf of \nmy country, as an expression of our democratic identity \nand responsible conduct in our relations with all our \nneighbours, and when speaking about the democratic \nfuture of all the countries in those regions, including \nthe Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia. The \ndesire to turn the extended Black Sea region into an \narea of peace, stability and prosperity should continue \nto guide our cooperation. We express our support, one \nagain, for a democratic, secure and stable region, and \nwe encourage our regional and international partners \nto broaden our solidarity with Ukraine, Moldova and \nGeorgia.\n\nA source of concern to all of us is the multiplication \nof political, security and strategic challenges in the \nsouthern neighbourhood of the European Union and in \nthe Middle East. The proliferation of radical Islamist \nmovements and the emergence of new groups, such as \nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), have led \nto an enhanced terrorist threat. They represent a new \nbreed of terrorism, which threatens to destabilize the \nentire Middle East and the world. ISIS goes beyond Iraq \nand Syria, and therefore represents a major challenge to \nthe international order and must be dealt with by all \nStates. We must all stand united and fight terrorism \nwherever it arises. I want to express my country\u2019s firm \nsupport for building solidarity in confronting this new \nchallenge.\n\nIn the field of development, we believe that the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly is crucial \nfor the preparation of the post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment agenda, which will guide our actions in \n\ncoming decades. As a member of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals, Romania \nmade its contribution to that very important process, in \naccordance with the decisions taken at United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development. Our national \nvision of the future goals was adopted by the Government \nof Romania in December 2013, and we are pleased to \nsee that our areas of interest are reflected in the report \nof the Open Working Group (see A/67/941). The future \ndevelopment agenda should address poverty eradication \nand sustainable development, good governance and the \nrule of law. However, it should also provide a platform \nfor social inclusion and the reduction of unemployment, \ngiving our present and future generations of young \npeople confidence and hope.\n\n\nOver the past year, the number of people in need \nof humanitarian assistance, especially the number of \nrefugees and internally displaced persons, has grown \nto unprecedented levels. We commend and support \nthe assistance provided to those persons by the United \nNations system in close cooperation with international \norganizations, non-governmental organizations and \ninternational donors. Despite our limited financial \nresources, we have made efforts to contribute to the \nprocess of assisting refugees.\n\nIn that respect, I would like to mention the activities \nof the emergency transit centre in Timisoara, Romania, \nestablished by the Romanian Government, the Office \nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \nand the International Organization for Migration. The \ncentre, the first of its kind in the world, has proved to be a \nfeasible mechanism offering safety to persons in urgent \nneed of international protection, thereby becoming a \npractical expression of the human security concept. \nThat contribution reflects the responsible conduct that \nRomania has always adopted in facing global challenges. \nWe will continue to contribute to international efforts \nwith the same dedication and responsibility as our \ntroops and civil experts have already shown in several \nareas, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo, or places \nin Africa.\n\n(spoke in French)\nThe year 2014 has particular resonance for Romania \nand brings us closer to our national centennial, \nwhich we will celebrate in 2018. In 1989, Romanians \nchose democracy and respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. We encountered difficulties, \nbut our resolve led us to a successful transition.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our firm \nand continuing commitment to the Organization and \nthe Charter of the United Nations and their governing \nvalues and principles. Romania will continue to uphold \ninternational law and the principle of the peaceful \nresolution of conflicts, while promoting human rights \nin order to achieve prosperity for all.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and pleasure for me to take the floor \nfor the first time in this world forum as Prime Minister \nand Head of Government, proudly representing the \nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nAt the outset, please allow me to congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at the sixty-ninth session and to offer our full \nsupport during the current session, which we wish to \nbe crowned with success. Your election resulted from \nthe Member States\u2019 recognition of the experience that \nthe Republic of Uganda has accumulated and of the \nincreasingly significant role that the African continent \nplays in the international community in consolidating \npeace and security worldwide. It also reflects your \nefforts to achieve sustainable development for the \ndeveloping countries, in addition to your outstanding \nprofessional qualifications, which testify to your \ntechnical knowledge and life experience. We are certain \nthat your diplomatic experience will greatly contribute \nto the favourable outcome of our work and help us to \ndiscover ways of resolving matters of major concern to \nthe international community. \n\nWe also welcome the important and relevant theme \nof this session, \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d. \nThe post-2015 development agenda, when properly \ndefined and structured, will certainly become a useful \ninstrument to guide developing countries, particularly \nthose of the African continent, to sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nWe wish to express our appreciation to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his competent, selfless \nand zealous stewardship of the Organization. We \ncongratulate Mr. John William Ashe, who zealously \nand selflessly presided over the deliberations of the \nAssembly at the sixty-eighth session for the past \n12 months. \n\nThe pertinence of the theme chosen for the sixty-\nninth session of the General Assembly is clear in \nthe light of the persisting economic and financial \f\ncrisis that continues to ravage the world. We must \ncombine our efforts and focus them on building the \nmore just and auspicious future to which our peoples \nlegitimately aspire. To that end, Africa has identified \nthe six pillars on which its sustainable development \nshould rest: structural economic transformation and \ninclusive growth; science, technology and innovation; \npeople-centred development; environmental \nsustainability, natural resources management and \ndisaster management; peace and security; and finance \nand partnerships. \n\nFrom our perspective, those pillars emanate from \nthe aspirations of our African nations. All partners of \nthe African continent should take them into account \nin the arduous efforts to bring about sustainable and \nequitable development and enhance the dignity of our \npeoples. Therefore, Sao Tome and Principe believes in \nsustainable development in Africa, based on the pillars \nproposed by the African Union. It calls on the United \nNations to adapt its programme to the specific realities \nof Africa, without losing sight of the accomplishments \nof certain countries in attaining some of the eight \nMillennium Development Goals.\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of \nthe United Nations is to maintain peace and security \naround the world, which is a sine qua non for the \npromotion of development. However, in the light of \nthe significant changes that the world has undergone \nsince the establishment of our Organization in 1945, \nwe must stress the urgent need to adapt it to the new \nchallenges of our time. Therefore, we again reiterate \nour call for the acceleration of the ongoing process of \nreform throughout the entire United Nations system, in \norder to imbue its operations with greater dynamism, \nrepresentativeness, effectiveness, capacity and \nlegitimacy, thereby leadingto the maintenance of peace \nand security and thus to the promotion of development \nworldwide.\n\nWe unfortunately continue to observe the persistence \nof some conflict areas and the outbreak of new \ntensions, with alarmingly significant humanitarian \nrepercussions, throughout the world. In Mali and in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, despite the relative \nstabilization of conflict zones as a result of United \nNations efforts, we think that the combined operations \nmust continue in order to consolidate and strengthen \nthe achievements. \n\nWe are grateful for the resolution of the situation \nin Guinea-Bissau, where the transition process has \nled to the election of a new President of the Republic \nand a new Government, thereby repositioning the \ncountry in accordance with regular and institutional \ndemocratic processes. However, it is incumbent on \nthe international community, particularly the United \nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community \nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Community \nof Portuguese-speaking Countries, to continue to \ncollaborate and combine their efforts to consolidate \nthe democratic rule of law so that our sister nation may \nadvance the progress and well-being of its people.\n\nIt is with enormous and fraternal satisfaction that \nwe commend the political actors in Mozambique for \ntheir great maturity and for taking into account the \nhigher interests of their people by recently signing a \npeace agreement, thereby avoiding more suffering and \nloss of human lives.\n\nWith regard to the Central African Republic, we \nwelcome the decision of the United Nations to dispatch \nthe Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \nin the Central African Republic to end the suffering \nof that country\u2019s people and clear the way for national \nreconciliation. The reconciliation process began with \nthe recent Brazzaville forum and should be completed \nby the Bangui forum and the holding of elections. These \nshould open a window of opportunity for the resolution \nof the disturbing crisis in the Central African Republic, \nwhich is in our subregion, and enable it to return to \ninstitutional normalcy.\n\nWith respect to South Sudan, we encourage \nefforts to convince the conflicting parties to engage \nin negotiations with a view to seeking solutions for \ntheir existing differences and ending the suffering of \ninnocent civilians. In Western Sahara, the long-standing \nsituation continues to be a matter of concern for us and \nto require a greater involvement from the international \ncommunity so that the long negotiation process can \nfinally be completed. Therefore, we renew our call for \nthe involved parties to return to the negotiating table in \norder to reach a mutually acceptable political solution.\n\nIn the light of the resurgence of acts of international \nterrorism everywhere, it is imperative for all the \nmembers of the international community to coordinate \ntheir actions, since that is the only way the world will \nbe able to overcome that scourge. To that end, we wish \nto note our apprehension and express our concern \n\n\n\nwith regard to the actions perpetrated by Boko Haram \nin our neighbour, the Republic of Nigeria, and the \nconsequences of such actions. Nigeria is a country \nwith which Sao Tome and Principe maintains ties of \nfriendship and multiple relations of understanding and \ncooperation in areas of common interest. \n\nWe are also troubled by the recent phenomenon of \nthe Islamic State and its implications. The Middle East, \nunfortunately, continues on the path of bloody conflicts. \nThese have taken an enormous number of human \nlives, owing to the long-standing hostilities between \nIsrael and Palestine, whose devastating consequences \nthe world recently witnessed. Therefore, we welcome \nthe recent ceasefire between the two parties, and we \nrenew our call for a negotiated solution that will ensure \nthe Palestinian people\u2019s right to control their own \ndestiny, as well as the State of Israel\u2019s right to exist, in \naccordance with the relevant resolutions.\n\nSimilarly, there is no military solution for the \npersistent internal conflict in Syria, which has also \ncreated disastrous humanitarian consequences. \nTherefore, we welcome the recent ceasefire between \nthe parties and renew our call for a compromise to be \nreached, with the help and support of the international \ncommunity, in order to end the hostilities and clear the \nway for a frank dialogue across the negotiating table \nand a political solution for lasting peace.\n\nAs to the conflict in Ukraine, which is also \ncausing the loss of many human lives, the Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe regrets the situation \nand calls on the parties to move forward rapidly, \nthrough dialogue, in resolving their differences. The \ninternational community must make all efforts to \nfacilitate such dialogue.\n\nWe believe that the Assembly will agree with us when \nwe say that global security is vital for the sustainable \ndevelopment of our countries. Therefore, considering \nthat Sao Tome and Principe is centrally located in the \nGulf of Guinea, a region that is strongly affected by \npiracy, terrorism, drug trafficking and other illicit acts \ncommitted at sea, we have taken national steps to fight \nthose phenomena, including the drafting of a legislative \nframework for the modernization of the armed forces, \nbased on a strategy that focuses decisively on the sea \nand its resources.\n\nAt the subregional level, we have worked, as \npart of the tripartite partnership of ECOWAS, the \nEconomic Community of Central African States and \nthe Gulf of Guinea Commission, to implement the \nrecommendations of the Summit of Heads of State \nand Government on Maritime Safety and Security \nin the Gulf of Guinea, held in Yaound\u00e9. To that end, \nwe welcome the progress achieved in the process of \nestablishing the Interregional Coordination Centre, \nwhich is scheduled to begin operations very soon, and \nwe renew our call to the international community to \ncontinue with us on the arduous task of ensuring our \ncollective security.\n\nWe strongly believe that taking steps to reduce the \nharmful effects of climate change is a responsibility that \nmust be shared by developing countries and developed \ncountries alike, in order to ensure the continuity of the \nclean development mechanism, particularly for the least \ndeveloped countries, as well as to mobilize the political \nwill for a legally binding global agreement through the \nadoption of the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change at the twenty-first Conference of \nthe Parties, scheduled to take place in Paris in 2015.\n\nThe trade embargo imposed against Cuba decades \nago constitutes another matter of great concern for us, \nand we therefore renew our call for the sanctions to be \nlifted. Cuba should be allowed to address its economic \nand social development challenges in an environment \nof normalcy, without the restrictions imposed by such \nsanctions, and to take better advantage of opportunities \nfor trade relations on an equal footing with other States \nMembers of our Organization.\n\nThe African continent is once again assailed by an \nepidemic of haemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola \nvirus, with incalculable consequences. In the light of \nthe high level of mortality and the devastating effects \nof the disease, on the one hand, and the chance that it \nmay spread to other areas of the world, on the other \nhand, we must urgently identify synergies to engage in \nan all-out struggle to save the thousands of lives that \nare threatened by this terrible scourge.\n\nIn Sao Tome and Principe, we fortunately have \nnot yet seen any Ebola cases. However, in the light \nof our country\u2019s vulnerability, our economic and \nfinancial weaknesses, and our health institutions\u2019 lack \nof experience in dealing with the outbreak, we have \nprepared a contingency plan and taken prevention and \nresponse measures, including entry and exit restrictions \nat our ports and airports, which may impact our fragile \neconomy. Members will understand that we must count \non the World Health Organization\u2019s help and on the \n\n\n\nsupport and experience of friendly nations in order to \nprotect our population against all sources and forms \nof contamination. In that regard, we welcome the \nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative in convening a high-\nlevel meeting on the margins of this session in order to \ndiscuss the matter and take appropriate measures.\n\nBefore I finish my statement, please allow me \nto note the situation of calm and progress between \nthe two sides on the Taiwan Strait. We welcome that \nenvironment and encourage the parties to develop their \nrelations through negotiations. Our country is pleased \nto see the participation of the Republic of China on \nTaiwan in the General Assembly of the World Health \nOrganization and applauds the fact that Taiwan was \ninvited, for the first time since 1971, to participate \nin the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization in 2013.\n\nTherefore, and considering the enormous potential \nof Taiwan, we would like to see its participation \nfurther extend to other specialized agencies of \nthe United Nations, such as the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, and to the \nimplementation process of the post-2015 development \nagenda, in which it could be of significant help to the \ninternational community.\n\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our country\u2019s willingness \nto continue to participate in the efforts to mobilize \nwills and facilitate synergies for the achievement of the \nbasic principles and noble objectives that guided the \nestablishment of the United Nations.\n\nIt is certain that today we are a democratic country \nwith a community of free citizens, but challenges will \ncontinue to arise in the future. Therefore, we have taken \nsteps to consolidate democracy, so that our citizens \nmay have an increasingly aware and active involvement \nin our collective existence and the political debate may \nbe broader and more responsible. It is hoped that these \nsteps will enable compromises among all the political \nforces to be achieved and to serve as the basis for the \nreforms that our country needs. We are fully aware that \nour country\u2019s economic performance hinges on political \nstability and our citizens\u2019 trust in our democratic \ninstitutions.\n\nI cannot conclude without informing the Assembly \nthat Sao Tome and Principe will hold long-awaited \nlegislative, regional and local elections on 12 October. \nThe electoral process is being managed in an \nenvironment of full normality, and we have resolved \nthe financial difficulties related to the elections with \nthe generous support of our development partners, to \nwhich we express our profound gratitude and esteem. \nWe expect the election results to be transparent and \nfair, as our tradition dictates, and that our country \nwill continue to be a benchmark of democracy in our \nsubregion.\n"

        "file_text": "I am proud to see you, \nMr. President, a distinguished son of Africa, presiding \nover the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, \nand I congratulate you warmly on your election. I would \nalso like to pay tribute to the President of the Assembly \nat its previous session for his sterling leadership.\n\nThis meeting is taking place at a challenging time \non the global stage. Several African countries have \nbeen dealing with an unprecedented outbreak of deadly \nEbola disease; the 200 girls abducted in Nigeria by \nBoko Haram are yet to be found or rescued; and the \nindiscriminate bombardment of Gaza ended only a few \nweeks ago. At the same time, terrorist groups continue \nto disrupt peace and stability in various parts of the \nworld.\n\nThose challenges are not insurmountable, but \novercoming them requires steadfastness and unity. We \nshould therefore resolutely reaffirm our faith and move \nforward, guided by the enduring values and principles \nof the Charter of the United Nations and all that it stands \nfor. Those values should guide our discussions during \nthis session, including on our theme \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d. That theme presents an opportunity for us to \npause and reflect on the successes we have achieved and \nthe challenges we have encountered in implementing the \nambitious targets set by the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). The creation of a better world through \ninclusive development, improved freedom from want, \nand greater security and prosperity, especially in \ndeveloping countries, are some of the priorities we \nagreed on 14 years ago.\n\nIn Namibia, the implementation of the MDGs \nhas had many positive results. We have reduced the \npercentage of our people living in extreme poverty \nby more than half. Primary school enrolment has \nreached 100 per cent. Health care is now delivered to \nmany communities where once there was none. The \nrates of new cases of HIV infection have stabilized. \nOur coverage of antiretroviral treatment has reached \n85 per cent, while the rate of prevention of mother-to-\nchild transmission now stands at 90 per cent. We are \nmoving closer to eliminating malaria as a public health \nthreat, and our provision of clean drinking water and \nsanitation has also expanded.\n\nNotable successes have been achieved at the global \nlevel, too. The living conditions of millions of people \n\nhave improved, especially in developing countries. We \ntherefore have a strong foundation on which to realize the \nsustainable development goals that are part of the post-\n2015 development agenda. In that context, urgent action \nshould be taken to meet the basic needs of all human \nbeings and the protection of the natural environment, \non which we all depend for our livelihoods. I believe \nno effort or resource should be spared in addressing \nholistically the root causes of social strife, poverty and \npolitical conflict in our societies.\n\nDeveloping countries, particularly African and \nisland States, continue to bear the brunt of the adverse \neffects of climate change. Floods, droughts and soil \nerosion have become more severe, prolonged and \nfrequent. Namibia therefore calls for implementation \nof the action programme and the dynamic Windhoek \nDeclaration adopted in 2013 in Namibia at the eleventh \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Convention to Combat Desertification.\n\nWe applaud the Secretary-General for hosting the \nClimate Summit during this session of the General \nAssembly. Its outcome should complement the \nnegotiations within the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change towards a meaningful \nand coordinated global agreement in 2015.\n\nGoing forward, our discussions and interactions \nshould be guided by the principles articulated in the \nMillennium Declaration; the outcome document \nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d; and the \noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences \nand summits on economic, social and environmental \nmatters. It is vital to ensure that the concerns articulated \nin the African Common Position be fully integrated \ninto the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nAs we prepare for the implementation of the \npost-2015 development agenda, we must demonstrate \nthe necessary political will and create strong global \npartnerships to realize our shared goals. Furthermore, \nwe should join hands to ensure effective mobilization \nand the efficient utilization of public- and private-sector \nresources at both the domestic and international levels.\n\nThe ongoing efforts to reform the United Nations \nsystem, particularly the Security Council, must be \nconcluded without further delay in order to reflect the \ncontemporary geopolitical realities.\n\nWe remain concerned about the political instability \nand armed conflicts in South Sudan, Somalia, Mali \nand the Central African Republic. However, the \nsuccess achieved by the Government of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, the United Nations Organization \nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo and the Southern African Development \nCommunity, along with the Intervention Brigade, in \nneutralizing the negative forces in the eastern part of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is encouraging. \nIn order to further consolidate peace, the voluntary \nprogramme for the disarmament, demobilization, \nrepatriation, resettlement and reintegration of the \nnegative forces must be implemented fully.\n\nNamibia supports the participation of women in \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding operations around the \nworld. In that context, we call for the full implementation \nof Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \npeace and security. Namibia has currently deployed one \nof the largest female police contingents to the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.\n\nNamibia continues to call for the lifting of the \neconomic embargo against Cuba. The embargo is \ncontrary to international efforts to reduce poverty and \nachieve the MDG targets in States Members of the \nUnited Nations. The listing of Cuba as a State sponsor \nof international terrorism is not justifiable and should \nnot be accepted.\n\nWe call for the full implementation of all relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions on Western Sahara and \nPalestine. The international community must fulfil its \nobligations and assist the people of Western Sahara \nand Palestine to realize their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination.\n\nNamibia condemns the abduction of more than \n200 girls and other innocent people by Boko Haram \nin the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We call for their \nimmediate and unconditional release.\n\nWe support international efforts to combat Ebola \ndisease in the African countries affected. Towards that \nend, Namibia has contributed ND$11 million to the \nfight against the deadly epidemic.\n\nAs prescribed by the Namibian Constitution, I \nhave the honour to inform the Assembly that my term \nof office as President will come to an end early next \nyear. Therefore, this is the last time that I will address \nthe General Assembly as President of the Republic \nof Namibia. I would like to thank Heads of State \nand Government for the excellent cooperation that \nthey have rendered to me and my country during my \n\ntenure of office. I trust that they will extend the same \ncooperation to my successor.\n\nFinally, let us reaffirm our collective political \ncommitment to accelerating the achievement of the \nMDGs as we move towards the implementation of the \npost-2015 development agenda.\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, Mr. President, I would like to extend my sincere \ncongratulations on your well-deserved election as \nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. I also express my appreciation to His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts. It is \nmy genuine hope that this year\u2019s session of the General \nAssembly brings the world, in its current critical \n\n\nsituation, a step closer to security and tranquility for \nhuman beings, which is of course a fundamental goal \nof the United Nations.\n\nI am from a region of the world whose many parts \nare currently burning in the fire of extremism and \nradicalism. To the east and to the west of my country, \nextremists threaten our neighbours, resort to violence \nand shed blood. They do not speak a single language; \nthey are not of a single skin colour and not of a single \nnationality \u2014 they have come to the Middle East from \naround the world. They do, however, have a single \nideology: violence and extremism. They also have a \nsingle goal: the destruction of civilization, thus giving \nrise to Islamophobia and creating a fertile ground for \nfurther intervention of foreign forces in our region.\n\nI deeply regret to say that terrorism has become \nglobalized from New York to Mosul, from Damascus \nto Baghdad, from the easternmost to the westernmost \nparts of the world, and from Al-Qaida to Daesh. The \nextremists of the world have found each other and have \nput out the call: \u201cExtremists of the world, unite\u201d. But \nare we united against the extremists?\n\nExtremism is not a regional issue with which only \nthe nations of our region have to grapple. Extremism \nis a global issue. Certain States have helped to create \nit and now fail to withstand it. Our peoples are \ncurrently paying the price. Today\u2019s anti-Westernism \nis the offspring of yesterday\u2019s colonialism. Today\u2019s \nanti-Westernism is a reaction to yesterday\u2019s racism. \nCertain intelligence agencies have put blades in the \nhand of madmen, who now spare no one. All those that \nhave played a role in founding and supporting those \nterror groups must acknowledge their errors that have \nled to extremism. They need to apologize not only to \nthe past generations but also to the next.\n\nTo fight the underlying causes of terrorism, one \nmust identify its roots and dry up its sources. Terrorism \ngerminates in poverty, unemployment, discrimination, \nhumiliation and injustice, and it grows in the culture of \nviolence. To uproot extremism, we must spread justice \nand development and not allow the distortion of divine \nteachings to justify brutality and cruelty. The pain is \nexacerbated when such terrorists spill blood in the \nname of religion and behead in the name of Islam. They \nseek to keep hidden the incontrovertible truth of history \nthat, on the basis of the teachings of all divine prophets, \nfrom Abraham to Moses, from Jesus to Muhammad, \ntaking the life of a human being is akin to killing all \nhumankind.\n\nI am astonished that those murderous groups call \nthemselves Islamic. What is more astonishing is that \nthe Western media, in line with them, repeat that \nfalse claim, which provokes the hatred of all Muslims. \nMuslim people, who daily recall their God as merciful \nand compassionate and have learned the lessons of \nkindness and empathy from their Prophet\u2019s teachings, \nsee such defamation as part of an Islamophobic scheme.\n\nThe strategic blunders of the West in the Middle \nEast, Central Asia and the Caucuses have turned \nthose parts of the world into a haven for terrorists \nand extremists. The military aggression against \nAfghanistan and Iraq and inappropriate interference \nin the developments in Syria are clear examples of \nthat erroneous strategic approach in the Middle East. \nAs part of a non-peaceful approach, aggression and \noccupation target the lives and livelihoods of ordinary \npeople. They result in various adverse psychological \nand behavioral consequences that are today manifested \nin the form of violence and murder in the Middle East \nand North Africa, even attracting some citizens from \nother parts of the world.\n\nToday, violence is being spread to other parts of \nthe world like a contagious disease. We have always \nbelieved that democracy cannot be transplanted from \nabroad. Democracy is the product of growth and \ndevelopment, not war and aggression. Democracy is not \nan export product that can be commercially imported \nfrom the West to the East. In an underdeveloped \nsociety, imported democracy leads only to a weak and \nvulnerable Government.\n\nWhen commanding generals set foot in a region, \ndo not expect diplomats to greet them warmly. When \nwar begins, diplomacy tends to end. When sanctions \nset in, deep hatred for those imposing them also begins. \nWhen the atmosphere of the Middle East becomes \nsecuritized, there will be a similar response. The \ninterests of Western countries in our region are tied to \ntheir recognition of beliefs and the desire of the people \nfor democratic governance in the region.\n\nThe establishment of Al-Qaida, the Taliban and \nmodern extremist groups has demonstrated that one \ncannot use extremist groups to counter an opposing \nState and remain impervious to the consequences of \nrising extremism. The repetition of such mistakes, \ndespite the many costly experiences, is perplexing. Let \nus recall that Iran had invited everyone to dialogue \nbefore the criminal act of 11 September. We also called \n\n\nfor a world against violence and extremism before the \noutbreak of the current violent atrocities.\n\nIn the past year, perhaps few people could have \nforecast the fire that rages today, but now uninhibited \nviolence and extremism present an imminent threat to \nthe world. It is self-evident that without an accurate \nunderstanding of the causes of the current situation, \nwe will not be able to find the right solutions. Today, \nI shall again warn against the spread of extremism and \nthe danger posed by the inadequate understanding of \nand incorrect approach to that phenomenon.\n\nThe Middle East longs for development and is \nweary of war. It is the natural right of the peoples of \nthe fertile lands of the Middle East to live in peace and \nprosperity. In the past, colonialism denied them that \nright. Today, the shadow of war and violence threatens \ntheir security.\n\nThere are moderate politicians and elites in our \nregion who enjoy the confidence of their peoples. They \nare neither anti- nor pro-Western. Aware of the role of \ncolonialism in the backwardness of their nations, they \ndo not neglect the role of their nations in reaching the \ndevelopment that they seek. They do not absolve the \nWest of its misdeeds, but they are also aware of their \nown failings. Those leaders can assume positions of \nactive leadership by attracting the confidence of the \npeople in their societies and can establish the strongest \nnational and international coalitions against violence.\n\nThe voices of such leaders are the true voices of \nmoderation in the Islamic world. They represent the \nfamiliar voice of an Afghan weary of war, of an Iraqi \nvictim of extremism, of a Syrian fearful of terrorism and \nof a Lebanese worried about violence and sectarianism. \nI believe that if countries that claim to lead the coalition \ndo so to continue their hegemony in the region, they \nare making a strategic mistake. Obviously, since the \npain is better known by the countries of the region, \nthose countries can better form a coalition and agree to \nshoulder the responsibility of leadership in countering \nviolence and terrorism. If other nations wish to take \naction against terrorism, they must come to their support. \nI warn that if we do not muster all our strengths against \nextremism and violence, and if we fail to entrust the \ntask to those in the region who can succeed, tomorrow \nthe world will not be safe for anyone.\n\nLast year I tried to fulfil my country\u2019s role in \nthe realization of peace at both the regional and \ninternational levels by putting forward a proposal about \na world against violence and extremism, which met with \ngeneral support. In the tumultuous and chaotic region \nof the Middle East, Iran is one of the most tranquil, \nsecure and stable nations. All the nations of the region \nhave to keep in mind that we are in the same boat. \nThus, we need broad cooperation with regard to social \nand political issues, as well as security and defence \nissues, with a view to reaching common and durable \nunderstandings. Had we had greater cooperation and \ncoordination in the Middle East, thousands of innocent \nPalestinians in Gaza would not have fallen victim to the \naggressions of the Zionist regime.\n\nWe in the Islamic Republic of Iran consider \ninteraction and confidence-building among the States \nof the region as fundamentally essential for conflict \nresolution. We support any measure to promote \ncooperation among Islamic nations to combat extremism \nand threats and aggression, and in that connection we \nare prepared to play our permanent constructive and \npositive role.\n\nThe oppressive sanctions against Iran go on, in \ncontinuation of a strategic mistake against a moderate \nand independent nation in the current sensitive \nconditions in our region. During the past year, we have \nengaged in the most transparent possible dialogue to \nbuild confidence regarding Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear \nprogramme. We placed serious and honest negotiations \non the agenda, not as a result of sanctions or threats but \nrather because of the will of our people. We are of the \nview that the nuclear issue can be resolved only through \nnegotiation, and those who may think of other solutions \nwould be commiting a grave mistake. Any delay in \nreaching final agreement only raises the costs \u2014 not \nonly for us but also for the economies and trade of \nthe other parties, as well as for the development and \nsecurity prospects of our region. No one should doubt \nthat compromise and agreement on that issue are in \neveryone\u2019s best interest, especially that of the nations \nof the region.\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between Iran and the 5+1 \nGroup have continued during the past year and the past \nfew months, with seriousness and optimism on both \nsides. According to all international observers, the \nIslamic Republic of Iran has carried out its commitments \nin good faith. Although some of the observations and \nactions of our counterparts have created certain doubts \nregarding their determination and realism, we hope that \nthe current negotiations will lead to a final accord in \nthe short time that remains.\n\n\nWe are committed to continuing our peaceful \nnuclear programme, including enrichment, and to \nenjoy our full nuclear rights on Iranian soil within the \nframework of international law. We are determined to \ncontinue negotiations with our interlocutors in earnest \ngood faith and on an equal footing, based on mutual \nrespect and confidence and on recognized international \nnorms and principles, removing concerns of both \nsides. I believe that mutual adherence to the strict \nimplementation of commitments and obligations and \navoidance of excessive demands in the negotiations by \nour counterparts are the prerequisites for the success \nof the negotiations. A final accord regarding Iran\u2019s \npeaceful nuclear programme can serve as the beginning \nof multilateral collaboration aimed at promoting \nsecurity, peace and development in our region and \nbeyond.\n\nThe people of Iran, who have been subjected to \npressures especially during the past three years as a \nresult of continued sanctions, cannot trust any security \ncooperation between their Government and those \nwho have imposed sanctions and created obstacles to \ntheir ability to satisfy even their primary needs, such \nas food and medicine. Sanctions only create further \nimpediments to long-term cooperation in the future. \nThe people of Iran are devoted to certain principles \nand values, at the apex of which are independence, \ndevelopment and national pride. If that obvious fact \nabout the nation is not understood by our negotiating \npartners and they commit grievous miscalculations in \nthe process, a historic and exceptional opportunity will \nbe lost.\n\nAs the Assembly knows, during the ongoing nuclear \nnegotiations this year, the Iranian Government took \nsome initiatives that created favourable conditions, \nwhich resulted in the new phase, the Geneva Joint \nPlan of Action. We are determined to continue our \nconfidence-building approach and transparency in \nthat process. If our interlocutors are equally motivated \nand flexible, and if we can overcome the problems \nand reach long-standing agreement within the time \nremaining, then an entirely different environment will \nemerge for cooperation at the regional and international \nlevels. That would allow for greater focus on some very \nimportant regional issues such as combating violence \nand extremism in the region.\n\n\nArriving at a final, comprehensive nuclear \nagreement with Iran will be an historic opportunity for \nthe West to show that it does not oppose the advancement \nand development of others and does not discriminate \nwhen it comes to adhering to international rules and \nregulations. Such an agreement could bear a global \nmessage of peace and security, indicating that the only \nway to attain conflict resolution is through negotiation \nand respect, not through conflict and sanctions.\n\nLast year, the great nation of Iran broadly \nparticipated in the calm and impressive presidential \nelection and endorsed the discourse of foresight, hope \nand prudent moderation. Thereafter, they support their \nelected Government in its effort in building the country. \nWhile some of Iran\u2019s neighbours have fallen prey to \nwar and turmoil, Iran remains secure, stable and calm.\n\nMy Government\u2019s principled policy is to work \ntowards constructive interactions with our neighbors \non the basis of mutual respect and with emphasis on \ncommon interests. The notion that Iran seeks to control \nother Muslim countries in the region is a myth fanned \nin recent years in the context of an Iranophobic project. \nThose who make such claims need imaginary enemies \nto sustain tensions and sow division and conflict, \nthereby pushing for the redeployment of national \nresources away from development. We work to put an \nend to delusional Iranophobia, setting the stage for \nbuilding strategic partnerships with our neighbours.\n\nLast year I warned against the expansion of violence \nand extremism. This year too I warn that if the right \napproach is not taken in dealing with the issue at hand, \nwe will get closer to having a turbulent and tumultuous \nregion with repercussions for the whole world. The \nright solution to that quandary comes from within \nthe region, not from outside, and must be a regionally \nprovided solution with international support.\n\nIn the Holy Koran, God the Almighty has promised \nthose who have believed and done righteous deeds that \nHe will surely grant them succession to authority upon \nthe Earth and that their fears will turn into peace and \nsecurity. It is my sincerest hope that our generation will \nendeavour to leave a more secure and developed Earth \nas its legacy for the next generation. I wish all present \nmuch success and many blessings.\n"

        "file_text": "I will start with the issue that I believe is of the utmost \nimportance today, the one causing the greatest concern. \nCurrently, the world is in a state of chaos which is \nproducing understandable fear and concern among its \ncitizens as to a peaceful and secure future. There has \nnot been so much war in the world since the late 1960s. \nToday, in many parts of our planet, there are low- and \nmedium-intensity conflicts that have the potential \nto produce wider regional and global conflicts. From \nAfghanistan to Ukraine, the Middle East, Libya, \nCentral Africa and other regions, we are witnessing \narmed conflicts with no chance in sight of our being \nable to stop them and reach a lasting peace.\n\nThese conflicts are accompanied by a rarely \nseen escalation of all forms of violence and brutality, \nparticularly against civilians. Increased numbers of \ninternal civil conflicts are causing States to fall apart, \nsome of them disappearing overnight, others arising \nwith the support of outside enablers. We also see the \npublic emergence of new political maps drawn with \nnew borders, separatist movements getting stronger \nand international laws being violated with use of force. \nThe situation is the result of the unilateral actions of \nsome great Powers, double standards in international \nrelations, the breaking of the cohesive legal world order \nand other actions contrary to the norms of international \nlaw.\n\nOn the other hand, years of economic and financial \ncrisis have led to dramatic social change with alarming \nsocioeconomic consequences. Despite growing global \nprosperity, the gap between rich and poor countries \nand nations is getting wider. The middle class is \ngetting smaller while inequality within societies is \ngrowing. Systems of social support are declining, with \nunemployment, especially among young people, taking \non alarming proportions. Given the general situation, \nwe must think about future development.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is at present a developing \ncountry characterized by an open and fully liberal \neconomy with foreign trade and economic ties directed \ntowards the countries of the region and the European \nUnion. Unfortunately, as a developing country, we are \nfacing the problem of a high unemployment rate \u2014 over \n25 per cent \u2014 a large trade deficit, lack of capital and \nmajor investment and insufficient and weak industrial \nproduction.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s economic and social \nsituation is similar to that of the region of the Western \nBalkans in general. It is extremely difficult. The \neconomic reconstruction and recovery of the country \nafter the tragic conflict of 1991-1995 have slowed since \nthe global economic crisis engulfed the entire world. \nHowever, while total economic growth in 2013 was \n1 per cent, industrial production increased to 6.7 per \ncent. The biggest economic problem is the decline in \nforeign investment, which in 2013 was 34 per cent less \nthan in 2012. Due to the general economic downturn \nin the country and countries of the region, as well \nas the damage caused by natural disasters and their \nnegative effects on economic and production activities, \nthe decline in indirect tax revenues significantly \nendangered the fiscal stability of the country.\n\nRegardless of current negative economic trends \ndue to the economic crisis, we believe that by using \nour natural resources appropriately we can achieve \nan economic growth and development that would lead \nto long-term progress and political stabilization of \nthe country. In order to do that, it is clear that we and \nthe region need the support of the developed world, \nespecially the developed countries of the European \nUnion, the United States and Japan as well as Brazil, \nRussia, India, China and South Africa.\n\nWe cannot achieve sustainable development that \ninvolves investment in the real sector of the economy, \nbuilding and developing transportation infrastructure, \npoverty reduction, and the effective and rational use \nof resources entirely by ourselves. We are too small a \ncountry and region to achieve those objectives alone, \nnor do we have enough capital to build industrial \nfacilities that adhere to green economy principles or \nprotect natural resources and put us on a sustainable \ndevelopment track.\n\nWhen it comes to the economic determinants of \nsustainable development, I am convinced that most small \ncountries share the same perspective and position. We \ncannot resolve issues of progress alone or prevent the \nemergence of the vicious cycle of poverty that threatens \nto undermine our societies. Therefore, in future we \nwill need to continue to adhere to the principles of \neconomic solidarity and mutual economic cooperation \n\n\nand support, and find a common framework of values \nand actions.\n\nIn addition, given the multipolarity of the economic \nworld, I hope that we will find more partners from \ndeveloped countries on our path towards development \nand recovery. The world of the future should not be \ndetermined by the false choice between haves and \nhave-nots. Apart from the issue of uncertainty for the \nfuture, every crisis entails the erroneous belief that rich \ncountries fare better than poor ones. Indeed, one forgets \nthat, due to global interdependence and responsibility, \nno one can survive alone; either we all do or nobody \ndoes.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains committed \nto meeting the Millennium Development Goals, \ndespite the difficulty of their implementation, given \nthe challenging conditions following the war and the \neconomic crisis. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed \nto regional cooperation with all interested countries, \nbased on the principles of mutual respect and common \ninterests. Bosnia and Herzegovina is surrounded by \nneighbours who are also in various stages of transition \nand democratic reform, and we share the same \nproblems arising from the complex processes that must \nbe engaged on our way towards membership in the \nEuropean Union.\n\nWe attach special importance to regional \ncooperation. Bosnia and Herzegovina has good-\nneighbourly relations marked by long historical ties \nand regional interdependence with Serbia, Croatia \nand Montenegro and other countries of the former \nYugoslavia and the Balkans.\n\nAll of us gathered here today representing our \ncountries and peoples need, in the near and distant \nfuture, to find concrete and clear solutions to the \nproblems and challenges caused by the broadest range \nof sustainable development issues, as defined by a \nnumber of the United Nations conferences over the past \n20 years. The sustainable development of countries, \nregions and groups of countries, continents and the \nentire world is a key element and basic starting point \nfor further strategic steps and activities for modern \nhumankind to resolve. The state of the world economy, \nenvironment and the contemporary society as a whole \nis full of problems and challenges that require our \nfull commitment and dedication to continued growth \nand the expanded possibility of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment in the world, which unfortunately slowed \ndown and stopped with the emergence of the global \neconomic and financial crisis starting in 2008.\n\nI should like to say a few words about possible \nproblems related to sustainable development in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina and the region of South-East Europe \nas an important European region poised to build strong \npolitical and economic ties with the European Union \nand other countries worldwide.\n\nI am afraid that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina do \nnot have the same starting position as other countries \nof the world in terms of inclusion in the sustainable \ndevelopment process of the United Nations. In 1992, \nwhen the first conference was held in Rio de Janeiro, \nwe were at the beginning of a horrendous chapter \nof our history and a tragic conflict whose negative \npolitical and economic effects have continued to cause \nsuffering in society. However, with the support of the \nUnited Nations and the European Union, today we are \non the road to recovery, with the hope of achieving the \nultimate goal of political success, namely, full legal \nintegration into the European Union and the economic \nachievement of developed country status.\n\nThis year the world is celebrating the centenary \nof the outbreak of the First World War. Incredibly, \nthe current world economic and political situation \nresembles the situation of 100 years ago. A crisis \nof economic depression, social disintegration, an \nineffective international system and the rise of armed \nconflicts and wars have led to a weakening of the \noptimistic driving force and a lack of global vision and \njoint action. The common goal that is necessary for a \nstable international order is fading on the horizon of \nspreading conflicts. It requires us to set clear priorities \nand seek new lighthouse beacons.\n\nThis year in Bosnia and Herzegovina we marked \nthe Sarajevo assassination that is commonly taken as \nthe direct cause of the start of the First World War, \nwhich resulted in the deaths of more than 15 million \npeople. At several events dedicated to the anniversary, \ntogether we have asked ourselves: Have we learned the \nlessons from the past of 100 years ago? When I see the \nlocal wars being fought on all sides of the world today, \nI am afraid that we have not learned those lessons; on \nthe contrary and in the meantime, we have repeated the \nsame old mistakes and made new ones.\n\nThe world needs peace more than ever. It is \nonly in peace that one can develop and prosper. The \nmaintenance of international peace and security is \n\n\nimperative to the development of every country and \nthe entire world. It is the responsibility of the Member \nStates to find acceptable frameworks and tools to \nimprove the security situation in the world in the \ninterest of development and progress.\n\nIn conclusion, three days ago I spoke in my \ncapacity as a Member of the Presidency of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, at the Climate Summit. Yesterday I \nmet with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the same \ncapacity. Today, the Secretariat has allowed itself to \ninterpret the Charter of the United Nations wrongfully, \nunfortunately. That is unacceptable. The future of \nthe Organization of the United Nations is based on \nconsensual agreement by all Member States and not the \ndecisions of the bureaucracy.\n"

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, it pleases me to extend, on behalf of the \nGovernment and people of the State of Kuwait, our \nsincere congratulations to the President of the General \nAssembly and to his friendly country, Uganda, on \nhis election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. We are certain that his vast experience \nin international affairs will enable him to conduct the \ndeliberations of the Assembly at this session wisely and \nably, and we wish him success in that endeavour. We \nalso note with praise the successful manner in which his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. John Ashe, conducted \nthe deliberations during his presidency of the previous \nsession.\n\nIn that regard, I would also like to pay tribute to the \ntremendous efforts exerted by His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon in leading the Organization, in \naccordance with the visions and ideas derived from \nthe principles and purposes of the Charter, to maintain \ninternational peace and security and achieve its goals in \na sustainable manner by confronting the kinds of risks \nand challenges engulfing the world, whether they be \nchronic or recent.\n\nIn its nearly 70 years of existence and service, the \nUnited Nations has witnessed increasing challenges, \nas represented by numerous incidents and crises, and \nhas overcome exceptional political and economic \nmilestones. That has made it a haven and a destination \nfor all the peoples and nations of the world, bestowed \nupon the Organization a wider scope of action to contain \ncrises and given it a more significant role in reaching \nsolutions and achieving further accomplishments.\n\nHowever, the deep-rooted and wide-ranging \ninternational transformations of the past few years have \nmade the continuation of the Organization, based on \nits current executive mechanisms and administrative \nstructures, an obstacle to achieving its historic mission. \nWhen we speak of change for the better, it is crucial \nto seek comprehensive reform by proposing scenarios \nand solutions aimed at reviving the Organization, its \norgans and its specialized agencies in order to ensure \nthe enhancement and development of their capacity to \nbecome more proactive, in line with modern times, and \nto deepen their understanding of the basic requirements \nof Member States.\n\nReform should start with the Security Council, as \nthe organ entrusted with the maintaining international \npeace and security and the closest to reality; it is also \nthe most effective and is already predisposed to measure \nits accomplishments according to its mandates. The \nState of Kuwait, which currently presides over the Arab \nSummit and coordinates the Arab Group, would like \nto stress the importance of thoroughly and carefully \naddressing the structural flaws in the composition \nof the Council, in particular the issue of expanding \nthe category of permanent membership by ensuring \npermanent Arab representation in the Council, based \non the demographic dimension of the Arab Members, \nwhose population exceeds 350 million and whose \nnumber increased from five States in 1945 to 22 at \npresent. That represents nearly 12 per cent of the total \nnumber of States Members of the United Nations, in \naddition to the fact that the issues relating to the Arab \nStates and their region top the agenda of the Council.\n\n\nSeveral countries of the Middle East are facing \ntremendous security, political and humanitarian \nchallenges and an exceptional situation, due to the \ninability of the Security Council to carry out its \nfunctions, which has led to the aggravation and \ndeterioration of the situation in many States of the \nregion. The recent Israeli military aggression against \nthe Gaza Strip lasted for 50 consecutive days, during \nwhich the non-stop killing and machine of destruction \ncontinuously targeted everything human, mowing \ndown thousands of unarmed civilians, the majority \nof them elderly, women and children. That action \nappears to have been emblematic of the series of Israeli \nviolations of the most basic rules of international law \nand international humanitarian law, and constitutes \nyet another addition to its bloody history of rejecting \nall regional and international initiatives to lay the \nfoundations of a just and lasting peace.\n\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the \nceasefire agreement signed on 26 August, as well as the \ninternational and regional initiatives undertaken to end \nto that crisis and aggression, primarily those promoted \nby our sister Arab Republic of Egypt. In that context, \nwe renew our call on the Security Council to assume \nits responsibility to provide international protection \nto the Palestinian people and territory, pursuant to the \nprovisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, \nand to compel Israel, the occupying Power, to halt its \nunilateral practices aimed at imposing a policy of faits \naccomplis, such as illegal settlements and the unlawful \nsiege of the Gaza Strip, in addition to attempts to \nchange the demographic nature of Jerusalem by means \nof Judaization. Israel must be compelled to return to the \nnegotiating table with a view to ending its occupation \nof all Palestinian and Arab lands, as well to achieve the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem \nas its capital, in accordance with the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions, the principle of land for peace, the \nroad map and the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nAs the crisis in Syria, now entering its fourth year, \nescalates into a bloodier phase, our concern about the \npotential regional and international repercussions of the \nfailure of that State has given way to anxiety about the \nexacerbation of the cycle of violence, which has already \nclaimed the lives of more than 190,000 people, created \n3 million refugees and displaced another 6 million \npeople. In that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes \nSecurity Council resolution 2165 (2014) on opening \nnew border crossings to deliver aid to the affected \nSyrian people. We hope that all concerned will pool \ntheir efforts to ensure the swiftest possible delivery \nof humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people in the \nbesieged areas and throughout Syrian territory and \nbeyond.\n\nIn response to the ripple effects of that intensifying \nhumanitarian crisis, the State of Kuwait hosted two \ninternational donor conferences, in January 2013 and \nJanuary 2014, to support the humanitarian situation in \nSyria. Pledges made at those two conferences totaled \n$3.8 billion, of which the State of Kuwait contributed \n$800 million. That sum was delivered in its entirety to \nspecialized United Nations agencies, as well as to other \ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations \nconcerned with humanitarian affairs. In that regard, \nwe reiterate the importance of continued regional and \ninternational efforts to reach a political solution that \nsatisfies the aspirations of the Syrian people for a free \nand decent life, according to the Geneva communiqu\u00e9, \nand that preserve Syria\u2019s unity, security and stability.\n\nWith respect to the sisterly Republic of Yemen, \nthe State of Kuwait, as the current chair of the Gulf \nCooperation Council, has sought within its mandate \nto establish peace and stability in Yemen, and to fulfil \nthe aspirations of its people for development and \nprosperity, in accordance with the Gulf States initiative \nand its executive mechanism. However, tensions due \nto the continued rivalry between some factions, along \nwith the resulting deterioration in the security and \npolitical situations, are a source of concern, because \nof their potential negative impact on the future of the \npolitical process in Yemen. They also pose a threat \nto the country\u2019s unity and territorial integrity. We \nreiterate our full support for enforcing the outcome \nof the national dialogue and for addressing the acts \nof violence and terrorism that some separatist groups \ncontinue to provoke.\n\nWith respect to the situation in Libya, the State of \nKuwait renews its support to the legitimately elected \nLibyan Government, as an integral complement to the \nprocess of democratic transformation that will ensure \nthe security, unity and territorial integrity of Libya. \nThe State of Kuwait also emphasizes the need for the \ninternational community and the Security Council \nto honour their commitments by fully adhering to \nresolution 2174 (2014), in order to guarantee a better \nfuture for Libya and its people.\n\n\nWithin the same region, concerning Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme, the State of Kuwait supports the ongoing \nefforts to resolve that issue by peaceful means and in a \nmanner that will guarantee the Islamic Republic of Iran \nand all the countries of the region the right to use nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes, under the supervision and \nmonitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA). We also emphasize the importance of reaching \ninternational agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, \nbased on full Iranian commitment to cooperating with \nthe IAEA, implementing all relevant Security Council \nresolutions and enforcing the highest standards of \nsafety and security in its nuclear facilities.\n\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its principled and \nfirm rejection of all forms of terrorism and extremism, \nwhatever their reasons, motives or sources. It also \nbelieves that promoting the culture of tolerance and \ncoexistence among peoples and nations should be a \npriority in its internal and external policies, which are \nderived from the tolerant teachings of Islamic Sharia. \nThe State of Kuwait emphasizes its full support for \nall international efforts to combat and put an end to \nthe terrorist threats facing the world, which aim to \nundermine the elements of international peace and \nsecurity. Kuwait welcomes resolution 2178 (2014) \nadopted yesterday by the Security Council, reinforcing \ninternational efforts to combat terrorism and foreign \nfighters.\n\nIn that regard, we denounce the actions of the so-\ncalled Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as \nwell as its terroristic practices and acts of aggression in \nparts of Iraqi and Syrian territory. We equally condemn \nISIL\u2019s grave violations of human rights and international \nhumanitarian law. We reiterate our commitment \nto support the efforts and endeavours of the Iraqi \nGovernment to overcome the destructive scourge of \nterrorism that currently threatens its security, stability \nand territorial integrity and that is adversely and clearly \naffecting the political process in that country.\n\nThe giant leap represented by new communications \ntechnologies, thanks to which the United Nations has \nbeen able to expand the reach of its lofty message, \nhas also increased the complexity of monitoring \nand assessing the fast-paced global environment, as \nwell as handling its output and consequences. The \naggregate expertise and experience represented in our \nOrganization at the professional, technical and political \nlevels is embodied in the United Nations Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). The Declaration\u2019s clearly \nidentified priorities and simple terms have played a \nmajor and significant role in improving the lives of \nmillions of people in many regions of the world. The \nDeclaration has also set an example by demonstrating \nthe importance of partnership in international \nwork, through cooperation and coordination among \nGovernments, and the promotion of the role of civil \nsociety organizations and the private sector.\n\nBy drawing on modern technology and scientific \nadvances, the Millennium Development Goals \nhave provided the peoples and nations of the world \nwith renewed hope for creating a better world, and \nhave created an incentive to achieve them. The \nOrganization has encouraged Member States to \ndevise a comprehensive and ambitious post-2015 \ndevelopment plan with sustainable development \nin all three dimensions \u2014 economic, social and \nenvironmental \u2014 at its core. That plan will address \nnew dangers and challenges and anticipate future \nconditions, which will be different from those we face \ntoday.\n\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the \nClimate Summit that the Secretary-General convened \ntwo days ago, and reiterates that climate change has \nnegative repercussions on development throughout the \nworld and in the Arab region in particular. There is a \nclear need for international action and solidarity within \nthe framework of the sustainable development goals, \naccording to the principle of shared but differentiated \nresponsibility, in order to guarantee that all States \nbenefit equally from the new agenda. In that regard, \nspecial attention and treatment should be provided to \nthe developing countries, which are the States most \nadversely affected by climate change.\n\nSince winning its independence and joining the \nglobal Organization, the State of Kuwait has never \nbeen far removed from the crises and challenges \nfacing the world. Our founding fathers defined a \npurely humanitarian approach to helping the needy \nand restoring hope to those who have lost it, bypassing \nthe traditional bases for giving, which were largely \nrooted in geographic location, ethnic origin or political \naffiliation. Their sons have followed that approach, \ngiving greater priority to contemporary trends \nthrough the pillars that define our foreign policy. That \ncommitment rests on devising and developing methods \nfor providing assistance and aid to the majority of the \nworld\u2019s countries by promoting activities that would \nsupport the message of the United Nations in creating \n\n\na world in which security and stability prevail, and \npeople live in peace and prosperity.\n\nThe establishment in 1961 of the Kuwait Fund \nfor Arab Economic Development was an expression \nof the sincere desire of the State of Kuwait to support \nthe development efforts of Arab States and friendly \ncountries by providing soft loans and technical \nassistance. In pursuing that approach, and in order to \nshow its keen interest in supporting the humanitarian \nrole of the United Nations, the State of Kuwait has \ndoubled the amount of its fixed annual voluntary \ncontributions to a number of international agencies \nand organizations, including its recent donation to the \nWorld Health Organization to combat the spread of the \nEbola virus in West Africa, giving wider horizons and \nbroader reach to the humanitarian work of the State of \nKuwait.\n\nOur wide-ranging diplomatic efforts at the regional \nand international levels, led by His Highness Sheikh \nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the \nState of Kuwait, were recognized by the international \ncommunity with an exceptional and unprecedented \ninternational honour when the Secretary-General \npresented His Highness with a certificate of appreciation \nin recognition of the outstanding role in humanitarian \nleadership played by His Highness, the Government \nand the people of the State of Kuwait in saving the lives \nof millions of people.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to emphasize that the \nState of Kuwait adheres to the multilateral international \nsystem, as well as to the principles and purposes of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. Kuwait believes \nin the critical importance of furthering all efforts to \nensure the continuity of our venerable Organization \nby ensuring that all States fulfil their responsibilities \nand commitments under international conventions \nand conferences in order to help find just and lasting \nsolutions to global threats and challenges, and to reach \nthe loftier goal of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity.\n"

I would also like \nto duly acknowledge the work of Mr. John William \nAshe, President of the General Assembly at its previous \nsession, to offer my best wishes to President Kutesa \nfor his stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession, and to confirm Montenegro\u2019s willingness to \ncooperate fully with him in his accomplishment of \nhis important duties. I emphasize the relevance of the \ntheme of the current session, since it is highly pertinent \nto our efforts to meet the Millennium Development \nGoals with the imminent arrival of 2015.\n\nAs ever, Montenegro remains committed to an \neffective multilateral system, resting on a strong United \nNations. As a responsible Member of the United Nations, \nMontenegro is therefore committed to continuing \nto contribute to strengthening the Organization and \nbuilding a functional, integrated system that promotes \nrespect for human rights, democracy and the rule of \nlaw, while devising and implementing global responses \nto global challenges. In that regard, we will continue to \nsupport the process of general reform and of system-\nwide coherence, as well as the integrated Delivering \nas One programme of action, based on successful \nimplementation at the national level. I am proud to \npoint out here that in March, in the most beautiful part \nof Montenegro\u2019s capital city, Podgorica, we opened the \nUnited Nations Eco building, host to all the specialized \nUnited Nations agencies, and offering the best possible \nconditions for their work and their implementation of \nthe Delivering as One concept. I see this project as a \nstrong tool of reliable partnership for Montenegro in \nachieving fundamental United Nations goals.\n\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \nMontenegro will continue to fully support the integration \nof human rights dimensions into all aspects of the work \nof the United Nations and to further strengthen the role \nof the Council in response to violations of human rights, \nwhile preserving the universality of international \nhuman rights law and the independence of the United \nNations human rights system. In our approach, the \nkey priority is to promote the rights of vulnerable \ngroups \u2014 children, youth, the elderly, persons with \ndisabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \npersons \u2014 and to promote gender equality and the fight \nagainst discrimination.\n\nPeace and stability, as preconditions for prosperous \ndevelopment, can be ensured through positive activism \nin global international organizations, primarily in \nthe United Nations, and the constructive approach of \nevery country in the sphere of regional policy, as well \nas a commitment to good-neighbourly cooperation. \nTherefore, Montenegro strongly promotes this \napproach in bilateral relations and regional initiatives \nin South-East Europe. We are certain that the success \nof Montenegro in the process of integration into \nthe European Union and NATO represents a major \ncontribution to the stability and opening up of prospects \nfor development of the wider Balkans region.\n\nMontenegro strongly supports global efforts \ntowards disarmament and non-proliferation. This year, \nwe ratified the Arms Trade Treaty, becoming the forty-\nfourth country to do so. Our ratification represents \nour contribution towards the entry into force of that \nhistoric Treaty, as well as an illustration of our firm \ncommitment to a responsible global arms trade.\n\nOpen and frozen conflicts, from Ukraine across the \nMiddle East to Africa, pose a threat to durable global \nstability. Of particular concern is the fact that the \nescalation of violence typically causes humanitarian \ndisasters and massive human rights violations. We \nfully advocate an urgent end to violence and a political \ndialogue that would lead to solutions in accordance with \ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and \nrelevant United Nations resolutions. In that context, \nwe believe that the United Nations and international \ncommunity\u2019s activities should place stronger emphasis \non better utilizing preventive measures under Chapter \nVI of the Charter, with a special focus on mediation as \na highly cost-effective tool for conflict prevention and \nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts.\n\nI would like to reaffirm Montenegro\u2019s strong \ncommitment to the responsibility to protect as a matter \nof national priority. Montenegro welcomes the French \ninitiative to seek a code of conduct on the use of the veto \nin situations of genocide, war crimes, crimes against \nhumanity and ethnic cleansing, and remains keen on \nputting that proposal into operation.\n\n\nThe rule of law and the protection of civilians in \npeacekeeping missions are of particular importance, \nand we stand for the consistent implementation of the \nmandates of United Nations peacekeeping missions, \nto which we are ready to contribute. Unfortunately, \nterrorism still poses an enormous threat to international \npeace and security, as evidenced by current events in the \nMiddle East. I consider it necessary to step up efforts \nat all levels in preventing terrorism, in accordance \nwith international instruments and the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\n\nMontenegro strongly promotes a sustainable \ndevelopment policy and, in line with our active \nparticipation in the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, we are committed to further \ncontribute towards the elaboration of a transformative \nand ambitious post-2015 development framework. I \nthink that the post-2015 development agenda must be \nbased on an approach of respect for and the promotion \nof human rights, where human development will truly \nensure that no one is neglected. Poverty eradication and \nsustainable prosperity for the benefit of all people and \nthe planet must be the overarching objective and guide \nthe design of a transformative development agenda.\n\nWe strongly support the important United \nNations mission implemented by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) relating to human \ndevelopment, which essentially affirms fundamental \nhuman values. We are proud that two weeks ago, \nUNDP chose Montenegro to host the presentation of \nthis year\u2019s Human Development Report for the South-\nEast Europe and Central Asia regions. We see this as \na recognition of Montenegro\u2019s progress, affirmation of \nhuman development, and proof of a reliable partnership \nbetween Montenegro and the United Nations.\n\nFinally, I wish to emphasize the fact that the United \nNations has a responsible partner in Montenegro, which \nwill continue to promote and pursue the goals and \nvalues fostered by the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure to join the \nAssembly today. Yesterday a journalist asked me to \ndescribe Somalia in 15 seconds. First, let me say that \nSomalis are great storytellers, so asking a Somali to say \nanything in 15 seconds is very difficult. I really had to \nthink about where to begin. I told him that if he could \nthink of a problem, then Somalia has it, and often at the \nsame time as other problems \u2014 war, piracy, extremist \nterrorist groups, famine, droughts, floods. But that was \nthe Somalia of yesterday, not the Somalia of today. \nI fear that many people\u2019s experience of Somalia is \nconfined to films \u2014 such as the recent Captain Phillips \nand re-runs of Black Hawk Down \u2014 or YouTube scenes \nof the horrific Westgate Mall incident in Kenya, or an \never-growing number of titles on library bookshelves \nthat include the words \u201cfailed State\u201d, or references to \na long war. But if we shrink our perspective to just \nthat glimpse, we miss the beauty of the very different \npicture that we are painting right now in Somalia. The \nSomalia I lead as President is a very different country. \nMy Somalia is not a 15-second summary of problems. \nIt is not a Somalia of failure.\n\nWe may still be fragile, but we are no longer a \nbroken State. September of 2012 marked a milestone \nfor Somalia with the establishment of a new Federal \nGovernment built on national consensus and universally \nrecognized by the international community. At its start, \nthe Federal Government of Somalia faced multiple \ncomplex challenges, a stark lack of resources and only \nvery basic institutional and Government structures. The \ncountry was divided, with no clear path to unification. \nAl-Shabaab and other militia groups controlled most of \nour territory. The task ahead of us was daunting and the \nexpectations from both our people and our international \npartners were very high. Everything was a priority, \nfrom security to political inclusivity, and from health \ncare and education to private-sector development and \nbasic economic reform.\n\nWe faced the significant challenge of having to \nbuild frameworks and institutions while simultaneously \ndelivering immediate, tangible benefits for our people, \nin the form of schools, hospitals, roads and more. We had \nto deliver on that long list of interrelated priorities while \nsimultaneously dealing with a politically fragmented \nenvironment and fighting a war against terrorist \n\n\ngroups. And we have succeeded. The foundation for the \nfuture has been laid through our clear military defeat \nof Al-Shabaab, which has been made possible only \nthrough the joint efforts of the Somali National Army \nand the African Union Mission to Somalia. More than \n70 per cent of Somalia\u2019s southern and central regions \nhas now been liberated from the scourge of Al-Shabaab \nand restored to the control of the Federal Government \nof Somalia.\n\nOver the past two years we have focused on building \nfoundations and laying the groundwork for reform. \nWe have developed legal frameworks, governance \nstructures and public financial management reform \nprocesses. We have formalized Somalia\u2019s presence \nin the international community, strengthened our \nrelationships with neighbouring countries, restructured \nkey institutions, established forums for dialogue, \ndeveloped a path for political reform and put in place \nthe architecture for linking international support to our \npriorities through the New Deal Somali Compact.\n\nWe have made major progress in reforming \npublic financial management, putting in place better \naccountability measures, controls and governance \nstructures. Key legislation has been drafted, budget \npolicy developed and the capacity of the offices of the \nAccountant General and Auditor General strengthened. \nAn annual budget, developed with the implementation \nof Government-wide work plans and priorities in mind, \nhas been delivered. A new governor and board of \ndirectors have been appointed for the Central Bank of \nSomalia, which we launched from scratch. A financial \ngovernance committee, constituting an advisory body \nheld jointly by the Federal Government and international \nfinancial institutions, has been established to provide \ngreater transparency and oversight of financial \ntransactions in Somalia.\n\nWe can take heart in the fact that distinct progress \nhas been made in moving the country from failed-\nState status to that of a nascent nation with functioning \ninstitutions. Today, in September 2014, I am confidently \nable to say that, with the support of the Somali people \nand the engagement of the international community, \nSomalia has undergone a remarkable transformation. \nToday we have a country that is beginning to unite as \na nation, behind a vision that in 2016 will see a federal \nand united Somalia, a Somalia that will meet our \naspirations for a better future.\n\nBut we cannot rest there. Somalia has always had \nan enormous capacity for playing a long game, and now \nmore than ever we must stay our course. Somalia is \nat a critical juncture in its efforts to achieve security \nand stability. This past year has seen a rise in terrorist \ngroups and activities around the world. Today, the reach \nof terrorists is not confined to one country; it is a global \nissue that requires global action. More than any other \nfragile State today, Somalia has significantly advanced \nin its fight against terrorism. We are winning the war, \nbut we must also win the peace. President Obama spoke \nearlier this week of being at a crossroads of war and \npeace (see A/69/PV.5). As Somalis, we know better \nthan any other nation the truth of that statement. We \nare at that juncture.\n\nThat is why we know that solutions cannot be only \nmilitary in nature. Yesterday we were reminded of the \norigins behind the establishment of the United Nations. \nWe were reminded of the power of peaceful political \nreconciliation. Military intervention can end war, but \nit cannot propagate peace. Dialogue, reconciliation, \nforgiveness \u2014 those are the tools of peacebuilders, the \ntools of nation-builders.\n\nAs President of Somalia, I reaffirm our commitment \nto denying extremist ideology and its servants any \nhiding place in Somalia. Somalia\u2019s strategic location \nmakes it a gateway between the Arabian peninsula and \nthe African continent. We cannot defeat Al-Shabaab \nonly to allow other extremists, such as the militant \ngroup known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, to \nfind fertile ground. Although the security situation in \nSomalia is improving and Al-Shabaab is becoming a \nspent force, we cannot afford to rest until we achieve \na final victory. We must strengthen Somalia and \nmake it into a firewall, both for security purposes and \nideologically. Somalia must be strengthened in order to \nprevent the African continent from being once again \ninvaded by violent extremists who target innocent \ncivilians, spreading their ideology of death. Solutions \nmust be sought by applying the rule of law, pursuing \nhuman rights and affording access to justice. People \nmust be allowed to determine their own future and to \nfind their own place in that brilliant future.\n\nWe must not forget the importance of political \nreconciliation and reform in maintaining long-term \nstability and creating an enabling environment for \ndevelopment gains. Two years ago, it quickly became \nclear that the formation of a unified and federal Somalia \nwas the key to delivering peace and building sustainable \nsecurity. The Vision 2016 framework was developed \nto encapsulate that important national goal. Vision \n\n\n2016 outlines the framework for federalism through \nreconciliation, the adoption of a revised permanent \nconstitution through a referendum and the path to \ndemocratic elections. It is a tall order that cannot be \noverstated.\n\nThe Federal Government has undertaken to revise \nour Provisional Constitution by 2016 and adopt it by \nmeans of a public referendum. We have undertaken to \ndeliver a federal Somalia made up of member states. We \nhave undertaken to deliver credible, national elections. \nWe have not failed on the side of ambition, and we \nmust not fail to deliver on our ambition. And we are \ndelivering. Led by the Federal Government, together \nwith existing and emerging regional stakeholders \ninside Somalia, we have made significant progress in \nthe formation of interim regional administrations in \nthe south-west and central regions of Somalia through \ndialogue and consultations.\n\nThe Constitution Review and Implementation \nCommission was set up in May 2014 and started work \non reviewing the current Provisional Constitution of \nSomalia. The approval and adoption of the Provisional \nConstitution is critical to an inclusive political \nsettlement that paves the way for sustainable security \nand development in Somalia.\n\nIn order to create a federal State, it will be \nessential to ensure the full participation of subfederal \nadministrations in the political transformation of \nSomalia. The Boundaries and Federation Commission \nwill be established and will devise the mechanisms \nfor supporting the process of federating Somalia. The \nNational Independent Electoral Commission will be \nendorsed by Parliament by the end of 2014. The Federal \nGovernment is committed to inclusivity and, while \nobserving the principles of Somali-Somali dialogue, is \ntaking concrete steps to engage all Somalis, including \nwomen and minority groups, in the political process \nof nation-building. We have seen great progress in \nconnecting the Government to the Somali public, thanks \nto the improvement of service delivery, particularly in \nthe area of education. In two years we have enrolled \nclose to 100,000 students in public schools and \nappointed 2,000 teachers.\n\nWe are investing in the strengthening of our Somali \nnational forces. The Somali National Army is a key \nelement in defeating Al-Shabaab, and we are working \nwith our international partners to ensure that we have \na well-trained, well-equipped, integrated national army \nand other defence institutions in place, so that Somalia \nwill one day be well able to defend its own peace and \nparticipate in international peace.\n\nHowever, it grieves me to report today that \nthe humanitarian situation in Somalia is extremely \ncritical. About 3.2 million Somalis need life-saving \nor livelihood assistance right now. A terrible mix of \ndrought, rising food prices, increasing malnutrition \nand insecurity is plunging Somalia into a humanitarian \ncrisis not dissimilar to the horrific famine of 2011. Out \nof a population of 12.3 million in Somalia, more than \n1 million people face acute food insecurity today and an \nequal number of people are internally displaced. Three \nmonths ago the humanitarian community and the Federal \nGovernment sounded the alarm about the impending \ncrisis. Humanitarian response plans were prepared \nand launched. Swift action by the Federal Government \nto set up an interim interministerial committee and \ninterventions with humanitarian partners and donors \nhas mitigated the current crisis. However, a sustained \nand scaled-up response is required now to prevent a \nfree fall. The humanitarian appeal for Somalia remains \nseverely underfunded. Only 32 per cent of the requested \n$933 million has been received. This situation must be \naddressed urgently. As we enter the last third of the \nyear, more than half a billion dollars is still required \nfor life-saving activities. Over the past 18 months, \nSomalia has seen a significant amount of progress in \nits political, economic and development sectors. If the \ncurrent humanitarian situation deteriorates into a crisis, \nall those gains will be undermined. We have come too \nfar to allow that to happen.\n\nIt is clear that, despite challenges, Somalia is \nmoving forward on the path of integration, inclusivity \nand peace. We are leaving behind the disorder and \ndiscord spread by a distorted ideology. I was told \na remarkable story recently, a true story that I think \nillustrates perfectly the power of reconciliation and the \ntriumph of compassion over brutality. One of our Somali \nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) is running a \nsocial reconciliation programme in some remote areas \nof Somalia. It consists of 12 weeks of intense facilitated \ndiscussions about truth, designed to disrupt the cycle \nof violence and create a safe space where people can \ntell their stories and, through that exercise, nurture \nunderstanding. A young man whose family had moved \nto another country when his father was murdered by \nanother man from his village heard of the programme. \nHe heard that the Somali NGO was training programme \n\n\nfacilitators, people who would be able to move freely \nfrom one village to another and teach others the way of \npeace and reconciliation. Rather than as an opportunity \nto pursue peace, this young man, filled with anger at his \nfather\u2019s murder, saw it as the ideal way for him to exact \nrevenge. He would return to Somalia, undertake the \ntraining course, gain access to his family\u2019s old village \nunder a false pretext, and while there he would kill his \nfather\u2019s murderer.\n\nHe therefore came home to Somalia, bought a \nweapon, underwent the training and went to the village. \nHe made sure that his father\u2019s murderer attended the \ntraining, while harbouring the destruction of his \nfather\u2019s enemy in his heart. But then, something started \nto happen. As he helped the villagers tell their stories of \nviolence, of the endless cycle of horror, of the terrible \nchoices they had had to make, his heart softened. He \nunderstood that any choice that involved violence was a \nnot a choice at all. One day he stood up at the training \ncentre, addressed his father\u2019s murderer, explained that \nhe had plotted to kill him and begged his forgiveness.\n\nIn a way, this one man\u2019s story echoes the national \nhistory that we are beginning to tell in Somalia today, \nnamely, that our future will not be built on the ashes of \nrevenge. It will not be built on the stones of violence. \nWe reaffirm our choice of peace. We reaffirm that \nreconciliation, the path that we have chosen, will be \nwon through dialogue, through inclusive politics, \nthrough creating a shared vision of what Somalia can \nbe in the future. Our success requires the support of \nour international partners, but most of all it demands \nthe ownership and the commitment of the Somali \npeople, which we are assuring. As we continue towards \ndemocratization, now is not the time for scepticism. We \nhave laid out our plans, and we need to stand together \nto execute and deliver.\n\nOur achievements and progress have been made \npossible by the determination of the Somali people. \nWe welcome and acknowledge the strong support \nof our international partners and look forward to \ntheir continuing engagement behind our nationally \nled agenda. I acknowledge the commitment and \nthe sacrifice of our Somali defence institutions and \ngrieve the loss of our soldiers and security staff who \ndied in pursuit of peace. I renew my commitment to \nserve the Somali people. Somalia is indebted to their \nresilience and perseverance in the face of extraordinary \nchallenges. Somalis look forward to walking, together \nwith the nations assembled here, towards a peaceful, \nprosperous future for the nation call Somalia. We are \nvery much indebted to the family of the United Nations.\n"

We fully trust that, thanks to his \nable leadership, the work of the Assembly during this \nsession will come to a fruitful conclusion, and we wish \nhim every success in that endeavour. We would also \nlike to express our appreciation for the skilful manner \nin which his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, led the work \nof the Assembly at its previous session. In addition, I \nwould like to welcome the tireless and mighty efforts \nbeing undertaken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, to manage this Organization in accordance \nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, which focuses on the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. We thank him for \nhis commendable and special efforts to support the \npolitical process in Yemen.\n\nI would like to highlight a happy coincidence. This \ngeneral debate is taking place at a time when Yemen is \nobserving the anniversary of its two glorious revolutions \nof September and October. Those events were very \nimportant occasions for us, and I would like, therefore, \nto congratulate, from this rostrum, the valiant people \nof Yemen and commend them on their resolve and the \nsacrifices that they have made to achieve freedom and \nto put an end to oppression, injustice and despotism. In \naddition, I would commend our people on the efforts \nfor change that they have been undertaking wisely and \npatiently for 50 years now.\n\nSince the beginning of 2011, Yemen has taken \nmeasures to effect change and address the successive \npolitical and economic crises that arose owing to a lack \nof political prospects. Those crises all but ravaged our \ncountry and led it to the brink of civil war and chaos. \nThey have also had very negative repercussions at the \npolitical, economic, security and humanitarian levels \nin Yemen. The Yemeni people realized that the best \nway to put an end to those crises was through national \ndialogue.\n\nI would like, therefore, once again to thank all of \nthose who provided their support to the people of Yemen \nand to a political settlement of the situation in Yemen, \nin particular through the Gulf Cooperation Council \n(GCC) Initiative and the Implementation Mechanism. \nI would like to thank Saudi Arabia, in particular the \nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin \nAbdulaziz Al-Saud. I thank the GCC and its Secretary \nGeneral, Mr. Al Zayani. I would also like to thank the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations and his Special \n\nAdviser on Yemen, Mr. Benomar. In addition, I thank \nthe members of the Security Council for their support \nfor the righteous political process in Yemen. I thank \nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation, the European Union and all the countries \nand international organizations and institutions that \nhave supported my country.\n\nIn that regard, I would like to mention the \nexceptional and historic visit of the Security Council \nto Sana\u2019a on 27 January 2013. That visit was a strong \nsignal of support from the international community to \nYemen and to its extraordinary peaceful transition of \npower through political dialogue and on the basis of the \nGCC Initiative, the Implementation Mechanism and the \nroad map seeking to put an end to the crisis and steer \nYemen in the safe and right direction. We must also not \nforget the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, \nnamely resolutions 2014 (2011), 2051 (2012) and 2140 \n(2014). They have lent political weight to the work of \nthe United Nations on the political process in Yemen.\n\nNor should we forget the periodic reports of the \nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Benomar, \non the progress in the political situation and the \nchallenges that Yemen has been facing. Those reports \nhave played a very important role, because they have \nsent a message to all political parties in Yemen that are \ntrying to stall the political process; it is a message that \nsays that we will not let anybody threaten the unity, \nsecurity and stability of Yemen, with all of the resulting \nimplications for international peace and security.\n\nI would also like to commend President Abdrabuh \nMansour Hadi Mansour, who has shown great \nperseverance in rebuilding a new federal Yemen on \nthe basis of Yemen\u2019s inclusive National Dialogue \nConference. Yemen signed the Gulf Initiative for Yemen \nand thereby began the transition process. We were able \nto achieve the goals set for the first stage of transition. \nA Government of National Reconciliation was formed, \na military affairs committee was established, and early \npresidential elections were organized.\n\nWe then began the second stage of the transitional \nprocess. Among the most important achievements \nof that phase was the National Dialogue Conference, \nwhich took place on 28 January 2014. In addition, we \nhave set up a drafting committee for a constitution. \nThat committee is about to submit its first draft of \nthe new constitution. After the draft\u2019s adoption, there \nwill be a referendum on it. Furthermore, the Supreme \nCommission for Elections and Referendum has created \nan electronic register for the purpose of registering \nvoters.\n\nWe have made notable progress in the political \nprocess. However, Yemen still faces great challenges \nthat have nearly destroyed the country and are trying \nto bring it back to square one. We would cite, inter alia, \nthe many dangerous events that occurred in Yemen as \na result of the recent political and military escalation \nprovoked by the Ansar Allah group, which besieged \nthe capital, Sana\u2019a, despite the decision taken by the \nYemeni people at the inclusive National Dialogue \nConference no longer to use weapons or violence to \nsettle their political differences.\n\nThe Government undertook to deal with the issue \nof escalation wisely and patiently, because our nation \ncan no longer bear to put up with conflict. Indeed, \nthe citizens of Yemen are buckling under the burden \nresulting from successive financial crises. All of our \npeople aspire to peace and stability. A great many \npolitical efforts have been undertaken to end the crisis, \nwhich led to the signing of the Peace and National \nPartnership Agreement. However, the Ansar Allah \ngroup chose military means, attacking institutions of \nthe State, looting and pillaging them as well as private \nhomes.\n\nThe militia entered our capital, Sana\u2019a, where \nit remains. The success of the terrorist groups is the \nresult of political support and logistical coordination \nprovided by members of the former regime. But we \ntook a political approach based on conciliation and \nmade further political efforts leading to the signing a \nfew days ago of a new security annex to the Agreement \nin order to maintain social cohesion, so that our people \ncan devote their efforts to the political process and to \nimplementing the final stages of a critical turning point \nin our national life.\n\nAll political parties in Yemen need to undertake to \nuphold the commitments in the Agreement. In addition, \nthe international community needs to continue to \nprovide its political support and economic assistance \nto Yemen. We also need for strong and firm positions \nto be taken by the Security Council, condemning all \nparties that seek to undermine the political process. \nThe international community has condemned the \nevents referred to and has called on the Yemeni parties \nto respect the commitments and pledges made during \nthe National Dialogue Conference.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Yemen is also dealing with \nmajor economic challenges, including a scarcity of \nresources, an increase in unemployment and poverty \nand growing budgetary deficits. In addition, Yemen \nis experiencing a humanitarian crisis that cannot be \noverlooked, because half of our population, namely, \n14.7 million people, need some form of humanitarian \nassistance. Moreover, Yemen is currently hosting \naround a million refugees from countries of the Horn \nof Africa.\n\nWe have an annual humanitarian response plan in \nYemen, but the plan has not mobilized the necessary \nsupport. The international community knows, however, \nthat, if the humanitarian situation worsens further, that \nwill have an impact on the political process. In the \nface of the very difficult economic and humanitarian \ncontext that has nearly destroyed our national economy, \nthe Government of national reconciliation took the \ndecision to amend the price of oil derivatives, adopted \na set of austerity measures and fiscal and tax reforms, \nand agreed to provide social security coverage to more \n250,000 people. We have also put the final touches on \nan electronic human-resources management system \nfor police and army personnel. We are also working \nprogressively in the area of agriculture and fisheries.\n\nUndoubtedly, Yemen expects a great deal from \nits fraternal and friendly neighbouring countries at \nthis very difficult time. We need economic support \ncommensurate with the challenges that we are facing. \nThat support could reduce the costs associated with \nthe economic reforms that we will be launching in the \nfuture.\n\nYemen has seen an improvement in the security \nsituation in our country. We have taken steps to \nrestructure our armed forces and police. However, the \nsecurity situation in Yemen is still rather fragile and \nis an obstacle preventing the success of our political \nprocesses and economic growth. Yemen has been \naffected by the scourge of terrorism, which has spared \nno nationality, sect or religion. That terrorism is not \nonly threatening Yemen currently but the region and \nthe entire world. We have played a pioneering role in \nstriving to thwart a scourge that has embedded itself \ninto the lives and traditions of our people and of the \npeople of all the countries of our region and the world. \nThe number of non-Yemenite elements in those terrorist \ngroups is 70 per cent.\n\nThe international community needs to tighten its \nranks to help Yemen to combat the scourge. We need \nsupport from the international community to combat \nterrorism in the Pacific region and the Arabian Gulf, \nwhich is a window open to the entire world. We are \nseeking to continue our efforts very actively, and \nwe will spare no effort to ensure that our countries \ncontinue to go in the right direction and to put an end to \nall bastions of terrorism, to polarization and hegemony, \nbecause all peoples aspire to a safe, stable life, within a \nclimate marked by justice and partnership, legality and \nfreedom. In order to combat the security challenges, \nwe need support from friendly countries as part of \nefforts to combat terrorism. We also need cooperation \nin logistics, training and capacity-building, because \nYemen\u2019s stability will have a positive impact on the \nregion and the entire world.\n\nDespite the challenges that Yemen is facing \neconomically and politically and in terms of security, \nwe have not been sheltered from the other crises that \nthe world is facing. We have closely followed all of the \nsuffering the world over, but particularly that of the \nPalestinian people, who have been killed and mutilated, \nwith the infrastructure in their country being destroyed \nand new lethal weapons being used to commit new, \nbarbarous crimes that have cost the lives of thousands \nof martyrs and caused thousands of injuries.\n\nThe international community must therefore \ncondemn the war crimes and crimes against humanity \nbeing committed against innocent civilians. It should \nmake the occupying Power resume the peace process \nwith the goal of achieving a just, comprehensive and \nlasting peace that respects the decisions of international \nlaw and the Arab Peace Initiative. We would like to \nreaffirm our full solidarity with the Palestinian people \nin their efforts to see the restoration of the rights that \nhave been stolen from them, including their independent \nState, with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nThe ongoing cycle of violence in sisterly Syria is a \nsource of concern, since it continues to destabilize and \ndamage the entire region. Furthermore, some armed \nterrorist groups are exploiting the serious situation \nthere. That is a large-scale challenge that demands \nthat we all work together to find solutions, as fast as \npossible, in order to promote the aspirations of the \nSyrian people in peace and stability, while maintaining \nSyria\u2019s unity and territorial integrity.\n\nIn Iraq, we are seeing the activities of Daesh, \nwhich is perpetrating crimes against the population \nirrespective of their religious and ethnic backgrounds. \nThat is extremely worrying, because such groups and \n\n\norganizations are simply interested in acquiring greater \npower. They have nothing to do with the tolerant Islamic \nreligion or the values of the Muslim community as a \nwhole, which respects all the rights of others.\n\nThe events and conflicts we are seeing around \nthe world highlight the challenges facing the United \nNations. We must work to reform it so that it is able \nto settle conflicts and maintain international peace \nand security. I therefore urge that the Arab States \nbe given a permanent seat on the Security Council, \nsince the region figures so prominently in the work of \ninternational peace and security.\n\nThe issue of the control of nuclear weapons is \nurgent, since nuclear and other weapons of mass \ndestruction are a huge threat to the peace and security \nof the whole world. We therefore deplore the fact that \nthe conference on establishing the Middle East as a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone has been repeatedly delayed, \ndespite the efforts and flexibility shown by Arab \ncountries to convene it. We call on the great Powers to \nassume their responsibility to put pressure on Israel and \nthe other parties that are preventing the convening of a \nconference, whereby they are creating obstacles to the \nrestoration of peace and security in the Middle East and \nlaying the ground for an alarming arms race, which will \nundoubtedly have negative effects.\n\nIn conclusion, I would once again like to thank the \nPresident and the Secretary-General. We hope that the \nwork of this session will be successful and will help to \nmeet the hopes and aspirations of our peoples to live in \npeace and stability and lead a decent life.\n"

        "file_text": "I stand here today, as \na representative of a nation with strong ancestral ties \nto the African continent, to welcome the election \nof Mr. Sam Kutesa to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident \nthat the experience and skills that he brings to that \nhigh Office will be invaluable as we tackle the myriad \nchallenges that confront us today. To his predecessor \nAmbassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, I \nalso convey sincere appreciation for the leadership and \nvision that he showed in guiding our work, not the least \nof which was the success he achieved in setting the \nstage for the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nThe quest for peace and development has assumed \nan urgency we have seldom seen. We live in a time \nof great instability and conflict. At the same time, \nmillions of citizens face unbearable levels of hardship \nand endure unconscionable levels of suffering. Far \ntoo many of our fellow men and women are being left \nbehind. It rests within our grasp to build a better future \nfor our peoples. This is the time to put people firmly at \nthe centre of our development aspirations, to tackle the \nroot causes of conflict, to create a culture of peace and \nto entrench the principles of justice, equity, democracy \nand respect for the rule of law. Recommitment to the \nprinciples of multilateralism and fidelity to the ideals \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are \ncentral to our efforts to accomplish those goals.\n\nIn the coming months, our attention will be focused \non elaborating an international development agenda \nfor the post-2015 period. That provides an invaluable \nopportunity for us to address the critical challenges of \npoverty, inequality, global insecurity and environmental \ndegradation. The post-2015 development agenda must \nhave poverty eradication as its central focus. In so \ndoing, we must give due regard to the developmental \nstatus of each country, in particular small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) and countries classified as \nmiddle-income. Implementing and delivering the post-\n\n2015 development agenda requires a strong focus on the \nmeans of implementation.\n\nThe third International Conference on SIDS drew \ninternational attention to the unique vulnerabilities \nthat threaten the very existence and survival of that \ngroup of countries. Our ability to withstand the ever-\nincreasing risk of economic and environmental shocks \nrequires that we forge effective partnerships with other \nmembers of the international community. In short, we \ncannot do the job alone. Jamaica therefore welcomes \nthe support of the international community in joining \nforces with SIDS to negotiate the SIDS Accelerated \nModalities of Action Pathway, which builds on the \nBarbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \nStrategy.\n\nLet me say, though, that support for SIDS \nmust continue beyond support for the International \nConference. Our concerns need to be addressed in the \ncontext of the post-2015 development agenda. Among \nthose concerns are the full and effective integration of \nSIDS into the multilateral trading system, an increased \nvoice and participation in international financial \ninstitutions, the application of more relevant methods \nfor measuring growth and representing our state of \ndevelopment, and increased support for efforts to \nenhance our resilience to natural hazards and economic \nshocks.\n\nWe welcome the outcome of the Climate Summit \nconvened by the Secretary-General. The participation \nof business interests, civil society and a range of \ninternational institutions highlighted the importance \nof promoting concerted action among various \nstakeholders to address climate change. While the \nthreats posed by climate change may be theoretical \nfor some, they are very real for those of us who live \nin the Caribbean. In recent years we have had to deal \nwith the increased frequency of hurricanes and their \nwidespread impact on our land, lives and livelihoods. \nThe financial impact of hurricanes adds to the burden \nof the dire economic challenges that we continue to \nbear. Our fellow Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \ncountries in the eastern Caribbean will no doubt share \ntheir recent experiences with floods that lasted only \na few hours last Christmas but caused gross domestic \nproduct losses from which they have yet to recover.\n\nAs we prepare for the Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change to be held in Lima later this year, all \ncountries must be engaged in a cooperative effort to \ndevise an appropriate response to climate change that \nwill result in a steep reduction in global greenhouse \ngas emissions. We also need action to follow up on the \nadditional document to be adopted by the Conference \nof the Parties, which may be a protocol, another legal \ninstrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange that will be applicable to all parties. In that we \ndare not fail. Our commitment to addressing climate \nchange must be given effect at the twenty-first session \nof the Conference of the Parties in Paris next year.\n\nThis year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of \nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most \nuniversally ratified human rights treaty. The year \n2014 also marks the twentieth anniversary of the \nhistoric International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment in Cairo. At the same time, we are on the \ncusp of the twentieth anniversary of the fourth World \nConference on Women in Beijing, to be celebrated \nin 2015. This is therefore an opportune moment to \nevaluate the progress made in safeguarding the rights \nof women and children. All children have the right \nto live a life free from fear and violence. That is the \nessential prerequisite for the development of their full \nrange of skills and talents. Earlier this year, Jamaica \nwas pleased to host, alongside the Secretary-General\u2019s \nSpecial Representative on Violence against Children, \nan interregional meeting that examined the impact \nof violence against children. I urge members, as we \ncraft the post-2015 development agenda, to be seized \nof the importance of addressing the special needs of \nchildren and youth. We also call for special attention \nto be paid to achieving gender equality. Rooting out \nviolence against women, enhancing women\u2019s economic \nempowerment and promoting their equal participation \nat all levels of decision-making should be essential \ntasks in that regard.\n\nI now turn to the problem posed by the heinous \nactivity of human trafficking, a crime of global \nproportions that exploits the most vulnerable among us, \nnot the least of whom are women and children. Jamaica \ncalls upon the United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime to provide a framework for Member States to \ndevelop a robust programme to help to bring an end to \nthat affront to human dignity and freedom.\n\nWe cannot ignore the link between our efforts \nto spur development and the need to safeguard the \nhealth of our people. The challenges to security and \nsustainable development posed by threats to global \n\npublic health have been devastatingly illustrated by the \nrecent outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. As we heard just \ntwo days ago from the Director-General of the World \nHealth Organization, every day, every minute, counts \nin fighting the most severe public-health emergency \nseen in modern times. This is the time for courageous \npartnership, not inaction based on fear. An urgent and \nrobust international response is required to marshal all \nthe medical expertise and modern technologies that are \nat our disposal. The pandemic nature of global health \nthreats such as Ebola and HIV/AIDS, including the \nsilent killers of non-communicable diseases, require \nthat we employ measures to combat them that are \nsimilar in intensity and urgency to those used in the \nfight against other global challenges.\n\nJamaica is concerned that the conflicts in Syria, the \nGaza Strip, Iraq, Ukraine, South Sudan and Mali pose \nserious threats to regional and international security. \nThose conflicts are neither limited in scope nor confined \nto national borders. The instability in Libya, Yemen \nand the Central African Republic is equally troubling. \nOf even greater concern are the resulting humanitarian \ncrises and the widespread violations of human rights. It \nis undeniable that those crises are fuelled by the growing \npropensity to funnel and transfer conventional arms to \nnon-State actors, including rebel groups and separatist \nmilitias. The militarization of such groups often serves \nto further those conflicts rather than hasten their end.\n\nEach passing day, the international community is \nconfronted with new crises, the emergence of greater \nacts of barbarism, and the rise of more lethal terrorist \ngroups. In the past few months, we have witnessed the \natrocities of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \nand the downing of a civilian aircraft in Ukraine and \na United Nations peacekeeping helicopter in South \nSudan. We also dare not forget that it is now 166 days \nsince the Boko Haram terrorist group brazenly abducted \n200 schoolgirls, yet their desperate plight continues.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the number and scale of \nthose crises not only place extraordinary demands \non the international aid system, thereby hampering \nits capacity to respond, but also serve to desensitize \nthe international community to the horrific levels \nof suffering being borne by civilian populations. \nResolving those conflicts requires global and regional \ncooperation. It is clear also that conflict prevention \nmust assume greater prominence. We cannot continue \nto operate in crisis mode only. Our vision is that of \na United Nations transformed into a more effective \ninstrument for preventing conflict and securing just \nand peaceful settlements.\n\nRecent events in Gaza demonstrate that the need \nfor a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict remains as urgent as ever. Jamaica believes \nthat the cycle of violence will continue in the absence \nof a negotiated political settlement based on a just, \nlasting and comprehensive agreement that guarantees \nthe security of Israel and recognizes the Palestinian \nState within internationally recognized borders.\n\nWe reiterate our commitment to disarmament, \nnon-proliferation and arms control. In the Caribbean \nwe are acutely aware of the pernicious impact of the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, fuelled \nby a dangerous nexus with the drug trade. That \ncombination is the single greatest cause of fear and \ninsecurity among our citizens. For the past two decades \nwe have remained resolute in our call for a global \npartnership to fight that scourge. We are pleased that, \nwith the fiftieth ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty \nearlier this week, that historic Treaty will enter into \nforce on 25 December.\n\nAll States, whether small or large, have a role to \nplay in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. Jamaica is therefore honoured to assume the \nchairmanship of the First Committee at this sixty-ninth \nsession, which reflects our commitment to advancing \nthe objectives of disarmament, non-proliferation and \narms control.\n\nAmong the major milestones to be celebrated \nnext year will be the seventieth anniversary of the \nInternational Court of Justice. Jamaica is firm in \nits commitment to the highest standards of respect \nfor international justice and supports the role of the \nCourt. Jamaica\u2019s group of States has nominated the \nJamaican jurist Patrick Lipton Robinson as a candidate \nfor election to the International Court of Justice for \nthe term 2015-2024. His nomination demonstrates \nJamaica\u2019s preparedness to contribute to the work of \nthe Court and underscores that all States, regardless of \nsize, can make a contribution to the development of the \nrules and norms of international law.\n\nIn 2015 we expect to erect a permanent memorial \nto honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \nslave trade. Its location outside this very Hall will serve \nas a place of meditation and solemn reflection on the \nhorrors of slavery and the need to prevent its recurrence \nand to address its ongoing legacy. I encourage Member \n\nStates to contribute to the Trust Fund established to \nunderwrite the cost of the memorial. Only a small \nshortfall remains. Let us press on to the end and meet \nthe final goal.\n\nJamaica looks forward to the commencement in \nJanuary 2015 of the International Decade for People \nof African Descent, through which the international \ncommunity will undertake a range of activities to address \nracism, xenophobia, discrimination and prejudice, as \nwell as systemic inequalities and underdevelopment. \nPeople of African descent must be engaged directly \nin the range of measures that can be taken to redress \nthe legacy of the historic wrongs they have suffered. \nCARICOM countries believe that reparatory justice is \nan important element in that process.\n\nJamaica remains opposed to the unilateral \napplication of economic sanctions and trade restrictions \napplied by one State against another. We reiterate our \nsupport for an end to the economic, financial and \ncommercial embargo against Cuba, and urge all States \nthat continue to apply such measures to repeal or \ninvalidate such laws. We have it within our power to \nshape a world that is just and equitable and that embraces \nboth peace and development with equal fervour. As we \nprepare to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of \nthe United Nations next year, we recommit to the lofty \ngoals enshrined in the Charter \u2014 peace and security \nand the economic and social advancement of all people. \nLet us get on with the task.\n"

        "file_text": "I salute the \nGeneral Assembly on behalf of Iraq and congratulate \nMr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We \nwish him and the Secretary-General every success \nduring the session. I would also like to thank the \nSecretary-General for the vital role he has played in the \npast years in supporting and enhancing the progress of \nmy country, something for which we in Iraq are grateful \nand proud.\n\nFourteen years ago, heads of State and Government \ncommitted themselves to the fulfilment of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, \nfocusing on issues that are now still vital, foremost \namong which are social and economic development, the \nprotection of international peace and security, the end of \nthe arms race, disarmament, elimination of weapons of \nmass destruction (WMDs) \u2014 whose very name incites \nfear in everyone \u2014 fighting terrorism and widespread \norganized crime, guaranteeing human rights and the \neffective coordination of humanitarian assistance \nefforts, and promoting justice and international law. \nIn that context, we would like to remind the General \nAssembly of our very bitter memory and experience as \nvictims of WMDs in Halabja, the peaceful Kurdish city \nthat was attacked by chemical weapons in 1988 at the \nhands of the dictatorial regime then in power.\n\nNext year, we will celebrate the seventieth \nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations as an \nOrganization that represents international legitimacy. \nThat occasion will allow us to express the value of the \nOrganization and its achievements. It will also be an \noccasion to take up more initiatives to settle disputes \nby peaceful means and promote human rights and \nlarger freedoms and equality for all. We will also be \ncelebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Fourth \nWorld Conference on Women, held in Beijing, which \nwas a turning point in seeking to promote the rights \nof women and curb all forms of violence to which they \nare exposed. We need to promote efforts to protect \nour planet from pollution and create a sound, clean \nenvironment to fight the problems of poverty, illness \nand illiteracy.\n\nThe success of political parties in Iraq in establishing, \na few weeks ago, a Government of national unity that \nrepresents Iraqis every stripe was extremely important. \nIt is a Government that everyone feels represents them. \nIts programme responds to their aspirations and hopes \nto move forward with their provinces into another era \nof stability, internal progress and rebuilding. It is a \nGovernment that seeks to build friendly relationships \nin the region based on understandings that guarantee \npeaceful coexistence among States of the region on the \nbasis of mutual interests and good-neighbourliness.\n\nThe establishment of the Government was a firm \nresponse to a real danger that was stalking us all, \nnamely, the danger posed by Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant (ISIL). That infamous and evil group \nhas launched international terrorist actions to attack \ndefenceless civilians. It has ushered in a new era and \nbrought terror to a new level. ISIL has been able to \noccupy areas in more than one city in Iraq and Syria \nand established a State based on hatred and rejection \nof the Other. In the past few months, we have seen \nhow that heinous terrorist organization committed \ncrimes against humanity, such as killing and displacing \npeople, committing genocide and ethnic cleansing and \ninflicting great suffering on all components of the Iraqi \npeople with its horrific crimes and massacres.\n\nIt has kidnapped women and sold them as enslaved \ncaptives. It has destroyed religious shrines and houses \nof worship, as well as cultural and historic monuments. \nIt has oppressed components of the Iraqi people on \nthe basis of their ethnic identities, like Turkmens \nand Kurds, and targeted religious and confessional \nminorities, including Yazidis, Christians and the \nShabak. We would like to thank the free people of the \nworld who have expressed their dismay, rejected those \ncrimes and stood in solidarity with the victims by \nproviding assistance.\n\nThat terrorist organization disposes of huge \nfinancial and military assets. By declaring the so-\n\n\ncalled Islamic Caliphate, ISIL has become a magnet \nfor militants and extremists in the Middle East and the \nworld, who have declared allegiance to that obscurantist \nregime and started working under its command. Among \nthe most dangerous phenomena of that transformation \nis the emergence of a new generation of terrorists who \nhave American, European or other citizenship.\n\nThe Iraqi Armed Forces, the Peshmerga and the \nPopular Defence volunteers have been able to stop \nthe advance of ISIL and prevent its occupation of new \nareas. We also succeeded in breaking the siege and \nliberating cities that had been occupied by the terrorists \nof that dangerous organization. The huge humanitarian \nand military support that we received from United \nNations organizations, the United States, the States \nof the European Union and other friendly States has \nplayed a vital role in assisting us in confronting that \nobscurantist terrorist group. We shall neever forget \nthe support we received against that group, which \nconfirmed to our people that we are not alone in our \nfight against terrorism.\n\nI would like here to express the gratitude of all \nthe people of Iraq and our Government\u2019s appreciation \nto all those who stood by us in our war against those \nenemies of humankind. We would like to thank those \nwhose efforts made the Paris and Jeddah conferences a \nsuccess. And we would like to thank those who made \nevery effort to adopt a Security Council resolution \nthat guarantees solidarity and partnership in facing \nterrorism and the challenges it poses to everyone.\n\nAs we meet in the Assembly today, hundreds of \nthousands of displaced persons and refugees, who were \nforced to leave their homes without taking with them \neven the most basic possessions, look to us. Millions \nof defenceless civilians who have been forced to live \nunder the oppression and tyranny of the terrorists of \nthe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) also look \nto us. Their protection and needs are our common \nresponsibility. We call on the international community \nto stand by our side in this war against terrorism \nand to support our efforts and those of international \norganizations and friendly countries in alleviating the \nsuffering of refugees, who hope someday to return to \ntheir homes and to get rid of ISIS.\n\nISIS is a transnational and intercontinental \norganization. We reiterate here that eliminating it can \nbe achieved only by forming a unified global front to \ntake measures to fight the takfiri approach and dry \nup its connected financial, ideological, organizational \nand military resources. We in Iraq are determined to \ncleanse our land of ISIS. We would like to emphasize \nthat eliminating terrorism in Iraq will be an important \nstep in protecting our region and in ridding the world \nof that danger.\n\nHere we welcome Security Council resolution 2170 \n(2014), adopted in August, which calls on Member \nStates to prevent the support, financing and arming \nof ISIS terrorists, the Nusra Front and other entities \nrelated to Al-Qaida to prevent such flows into Iraq. We \nshould also like to commend the Human Rights Council \nfor its resolution condemning ISIS and establishing a \nfact-finding commission to investigate crimes against \nhumanity committed by that group against all Iraqis.\n\nIn the context of the international response to \nterrorism, and while we stress the importance of \nconsolidating the value and culture of peace and \ncoexistence in countries with multi-ethnic and \nmulti-confessional societies, we in Iraq call for \ninstitutionalizing such a responsible position at the \nUnited Nations. Such institutions must be tasked \nwith developing and operationalizing international \nsolidarity, using all the means available to fight \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and to rid \nthe world of its evils. We also believe that the time has \ncome to work collectively within individual countries \nand with all countries in the region so that we can \ndefuse tension about our security and achieve national \nunderstanding that contributes to limiting the space \navailable to terrorism, which typically lives off conflict \nand strife. The meetings held in Jeddah, Paris and New \nYork and the statements, declarations and resolutions \nadopted have sent important messages to the Iraqi \npeople. We hope that all of them will be translated into \npractical measures.\n\nIn the Middle East, it hurts us to see the recent \nsuffering of the fraternal Palestinian people in Gaza \nand other Palestinian territories. We therefore renew \nour call on the international community to honour \nits commitment to the Palestinian people and exert \nconcerted efforts to restore peace and return to the \nnegotiations table in order to end the conflict and \nachieve lasting peace and security. For our brothers in \nYemen and Libya, we hope for stability and the end of \nthe threats of terrorism and extremism. We also wish \nsuccess and progress on the democratic path chosen \nby the Libyan and Yemeni peoples. We hope that the \nfraternal Syrian people will be able to overcome the \n\n\ncountry\u2019s dilemma. We hope that Syrians will unite in \ntheir efforts to arrive at a political solution that ends \nthe bloodshed and preserves life. We also hope that \nsuch a solution will help neighbourly Syria to achieve \ndemocracy, peace and security in our region. Continued \ntension in those hotbeds in our region will only fuel \nextremism and extremist obscurantist ideology. That \nmakes us all want to work together to expedite a search \nfor solutions to the problems that contributes to creating \na humanitarian environment based on civilization, \nculture and freedom.\n\n\nWith regard to Ukraine, we express our concern \nabout the dangerous escalation of the situation. We \nbelieve that the international community cannot allow \nany exacerbation of the conflict, with the ensuing dire \nconsequences for civilians, whether they have been \ndisplaced or are forced to live in conflict zones.\n\nIraq notes the results achieved by the Open \nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals. \nThe Group\u2019s recommendations in its report (A/67/941, \nannex) constitute an important step and deserve our \nappreciation. We truly value the efforts they have \nmade to arrive at its conclusions. However, the issue \nof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations does \nnot occupy the space it deserves in the report. It should \nhave been incumbent upon the Group to address that \nchallenge as an objective on its own and to look into \nits core, manifestations, causes, repercussions and the \nways to address them.\n\nThroughout this era, humankind has been able \nto work to promote human partnership and enhance \nprospects for peace, freedom, human rights, prosperity \nand security. I stand before the Assembly today as a \nrepresentative of a country that was enervated by terror \nfor over a decade. On behalf of the millions of families \nof martyrs, orphans and the bereaved, I address the \nAssembly to stress that we have no other option but to \ndefeat ISIS everywhere. With will, determination and \nvision, we look forward to a future in which we can \nliberate our societies from the risks that continue to \nthreaten us.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like first to \ncongratulate Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I also wish to express my appreciation for the \nable manner in which the outgoing President presided \nover the Assembly.\n\nAllow me also to pay tribute to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his tireless commitment in the service \nof peace. I also thank the men and women serving the \nUnited Nations in the field. They do so often at great \npersonal risk, and their courage and determination is a \nsource of inspiration for the Organization.\n\nIt was 50 years ago that Malta became an \nindependent State. That was the year when Nelson \n\n\n\f\nMandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in South \nAfrica, and when Martin Luther King received the \nNobel Peace Prize. For a small, nascent State such as \nMalta, it was a year of promise and new beginnings \nas it took its place among the Members of the United \nNations. It is with a deep sense of pride that I stand \nbefore members here today to note the role our country \nhas played over the past 50 years to uphold the purposes \nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nTime and again, this family of nations has found \na trusted and reliable partner in my country, willing \nto contribute, in ways large and small, to the cause of \ninternational peace and security. I shall mention just \ntwo. The first is Malta\u2019s association with the Law of \nthe Sea \u2014 a widely acknowledged role, as we were \ninstrumental in the launching of the international \nprocess that would eventually lead to the 1982 United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The second \nexample, which came shortly after that, in 1988, is \nour being among the first Member States to highlight \nthe risks of climate change to the global community \nwithin the forum of the United Nations. An almost alien \nconcept at the time, today climate change is one of the \nmain items on the global agenda. I pay tribute to Arvid \nPardo and former President .ensu Tabone, who piloted \nthose events. Evidently, our size did not determine our \nambitions then. Neither will it determine them now.\n\nWe live in an increasingly uncertain world \u2014 a \nworld where the power balances that we have known in \nrecent decades have started to shift. What made sense \nin the past may not make sense in the future \u2014 not \ntoo distant a future, but the future that we can already \nsee forming before our own eyes. If the Assembly will \nallow me, I wish to share some thoughts by presenting \nfive challenges \u2014 five of the many that I feel we, the \nUnited Nations, need to face up to now.\n\nUndoubtedly, the first challenge is the conflict \nin the Middle East. We need a return to meaningful \nnegotiations, and I stress the word meaningful. \nThe ongoing tit-for-tat, the culture of hatred and \nintolerance, the self-righteous proclamations and \nthe recriminations are leaving nothing but death and \ndestruction. If we build walls around people, it is no \nwonder that they will dig tunnels to escape. The current \nframe of mind will lead nowhere. Too many innocent \ncivilians have died, too many children have been \nburied. We need statesmanship from the politicians \non both sides to resolve the conflict. Risk-takers and \ncourageous negotiators must be willing to make the \nright choices \u2014 not the most convenient choices, and \nnot the most popular, perhaps, but the most enduring \nones \u2014 that will bring about change leading to peace.\n\nOur second challenge must be putting an end to \nthe ghastly war in Syria, which is fast becoming a \nforgotten conflict of major proportions. Like many \nother countries here, last year my country called for a \nstop to the atrocities (see A/68/PV.12). Are we simply \ngoing to repeat that call this year as well? Let us stop \nthis humanitarian disaster, which, as we know, is now \nmorphing into the new threats we have heard so much \nabout. The adoption of Security Council resolution \n2165 (2014) demonstrated that we can act together, so \nlet us act. We call on the Security Council to assume its \nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations \nand to act urgently and decisively to bring about an end \nto the bloodshed.\n\nThat brings me to the third challenge. As if we \nhave not yet learned the lessons from Syria, or realized \nwhat sectarian divisions can lead to, we are allowing \nthe problems in Libya to continue almost unabated. \nWe are fast witnessing a descent into another forgotten \nconflict. We need to help the Libyan people take their \ncountry forward. There is a bright future for Liby, but \nLibyans themselves need to find the hope necessary to \nrealize it. They can begin to do so only with the help \nof the international community. The United Nations \ncan and must provide capacity-building and security to \nbring about stability and prosperity.\n\nOf course, we are heartened to see the constructive \nrole already being played by the United Nations Support \nMission in Libya. Yet immense challenges remain, in \nparticular in restoring the country\u2019s security and law \nand order. The divisions are rooted in many causes, but \nthey can be overcome. This situation cannot be allowed \nto continue further. Its repercussions are severe not \njust for the Libyans themselves or for the country\u2019s \nimmediate neighbours, such as ourselves, but further \nafield. The international community cannot risk a \ntakeover by extremists of that crucial country.\n\nTogether with our international partners, especially \nour colleagues in the European Union, Malta continues \nto actively support the efforts of the Libyan people \nto move forward. We are providing all the assistance \nwithin our means to aid the wounded. We will stand \nfor dialogue and reconciliation in Libya. We will stand \nfor peace and resolution. We will continue to draw \nattention to this festering wound. Our Libyan friends \ndeserve that. Disarmament and national reconciliation \n\n\nare the prerequisites for Libya to move forward. The \nUnited Nations must be ready to answer the calls for \naction from the Libyan people themselves.\n\nIf the Assembly will allow, I will directly address \nour friends in Libya in their own language, which is so \nsimilar to my own.\n\n(spoke in Arabic)\nThe families and the children of Libya deserve a \ntrue future. Freedom and justice for all Libyans can \nbe achieved only if differences are resolved through \ndialogue and compromise.\n\n(spoke in English)\nPlease allow me now to move to the fourth challenge \nfacing the world today, namely, the spread of extremism \nand intolerance.\n\nWe are living through a period of transnational \nallegiances in which we are seeing the globalization of \nhatred \u2014 one during which extremists are increasingly \ninterconnected through networks and inventions whose \nmain purpose should be progress and education. This is \na time when disenchanted youths are radicalized into \nmovements that know no limits. We need to look beyond \nthe borders of our nation States and work together, if we \nare to face up to the threats posed by extremists.\n\nNobody is immune from what is undoubtedly the \nbiggest threat to world stability and peace. Just as the \nhorrendous carnage of two world wars led to a shift in \nour thinking, the reality we are living in now needs \nto force another shift. We have to spread a culture of \nmutual understanding and humanity \u2014 not because it \nserves us, but because it serves our peoples and will \nserve our future as a global community.\n\nClearly, the area of the world from the Mediterranean \nto the Middle East, and beyond, demands our utmost \nattention. People are being pushed to the brink. They \nare resorting to increasingly desperate measures. \nMen, women and children are risking their lives to \ncross conflict-ridden zones and hostile deserts. They \nare taking to the seas without realizing the dangers \nthat await them. As I also did last year, I reiterate that \nmore attention must be focused on the plight of illegal \nimmigrants in the Mediterranean, which I believe is the \nfifth challenge we face.\n\nWith all our limitations, Malta is doing its utmost \nto daily save lives \u2014 as our neighbour and friend \nItaly is also doing. Again I call on the Assembly and \nthe international community to help to stop the great \nhuman tragedies that come with risky crossings across \nthe Mediterranean. The States receiving the waves of \nmigrants cannot stand up to the challenge alone: no \ncountry in the world can solve the problem of illegal \nimmigration alone. Just last week we witnessed in \nour own seas yet another tragedy, which the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \ndescribed as mass murder.\n\nCloser cooperation among the countries of origin, \ntransit and destination is needed. The United Nations \nand its agencies are already helping, but they must \ncontinue to help in addressing the causes. Better \ngovernance, better resources and better development \npolicies are needed. We need better enforcement \nmechanisms and stronger penalties to stop and punish \nthe criminals \u2014 the human traffickers. We need better \nimplementation of internationally agreed commitments. \nWe need all of that and more, and we need to remember \nto keep in mind the well-being of the human beings, \nthe families and children who are the victims of all that \ntragedy.\n\nAs a Mediterranean country, Malta cannot but call \nfor the world\u2019s attention to those challenges, which \nare threatening not only the security of the region \nbut also its development and growth. Such threats are \npreventing the Mediterranean Sea Basin from reaching \nits full potential, which is just waiting to be unleashed \nif only weapons were traded for books and hatred for \neducation. I reiterate my strong conviction that the \nMediterranean Basin needs to be given our immediate \nattention in order to once again become the home of \ngreat civilizations that it is and a cross-cultural haven \nwhere women and men of different beliefs and traditions \nwork, trade and mingle in tolerance and tranquillity.\n\nIt has always been our belief that there cannot be \npeace in Europe without peace in the Mediterranean. \nToday\u2019s unprecedented levels of interconnectivity \nlead us to believe that peace in the Mediterranean is \na prerequisite for global stability. Malta will continue \nto serve as a voice of reason, while striving to unite \nthe Mediterranean. Our only weapon is our historical \nand natural vocation for peace. Our resolve grows only \nstronger in such testing times.\n\nThe challenges that we face cannot stop us in our \ntracks. We can address them if we truly believe in \nacting as the United Nations. A year from now, we will \nanalyse the Millennium Development Goals and will, \nhopefully, agree on sustainable development goals for \n\n\nthe twenty-first century. With an effective development \nagenda, we can address the causes of conflict in a \nsustainable manner and can overcome the poverty that \ncontributes to illegal migration. But we need to be \nambitious.\n\nOver the past 50 years, my country has shown that \nit has been and can be ambitious in favour of peace, \nprogress and prosperity. It has promoted and will \ncontinue to promote the broadest possible dialogue \namong the countries of our region. I take pride in \nnoting that only a few months ago, Malta, together \nwith Algeria, France, Italy, Jordan, Morocco, the \nNetherlands, Nigeria, Tunisia, Turkey, the United \nKingdom and the United States, jointly launched the \nInternational Institute for Justice and Rule of Law, \nhosted by my country. The Institute will collaborate \nwith the United Nations and other international and \nnon-governmental organizations to provide training \nto lawmakers, police, prosecutors, judges and prison \nofficials to deal with terrorism and transnational crime, \nwith a general emphasis on the rule of law. We hope \nthat such work will eventually serve as a best practice \nfor the benefit of the wider global community.\n\nWe are also fully engaged within the \nCommonwealth, which brings together a third of the \nworld population, in order to help achieve convergence \non some of the challenges that lie ahead, including the \nsustainable development goals and climate change. The \nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that \nwill take place in Malta next year will serve as an ideal \nplatform for the discussion of such issues, especially \nahead of the Paris summit on climate change. Those are \nsome of the ways in which a small country in Europe \nat the centre of the Mediterranean, such as Malta, will \ncontinue to contribute to the fostering of peace and \nsecurity in our region and in the world.\n\nFifty years may seem like a long time, but I can \naffirm that 50 years from now my country will remain \nsteadfast in its ambitions and in our determination in \nfavour of peace and prosperity. Malta will remain a \nproud Member of the United Nations and a beacon of \nstability in the Mediterranean.\n"

        "file_text": "I particularly \nwelcome the opportunity today to represent His \nExcellency Mr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic \nof Senegal, before the General Assembly and to deliver \nthis intervention on his behalf.\n\nIn line with my predecessors, I would like to extend \na warm welcome to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa and \nexpress my delegation\u2019s particular pleasure in seeing \nhim assume the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-ninth session. In reiterating our warm wishes \nfor success in fulfilling his important duty, I assure him \nof the unwavering support of my delegation, which, as \nalways, will contribute in a constructive manner to the \nfull realization of the goals of the United Nations. I also \npay warm tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. John William Ashe, whose dynamism and open \nmind greatly contributed to the success of the sixty-\neighth session of the General Assembly. I also want \nto express, on behalf of the President of Senegal, our \nfull gratitude to Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon \nfor his tireless efforts in promoting peace, security, \ndevelopment and human rights.\n\nI am therefore particularly pleased by the \nopportunity to represent President Macky Sall and \nto take the opportunity offered to my delegation to \nwelcome the conclusions of the Open Working Group \non Sustainable Development Goals and those on the \nfinancing of sustainable development for the purpose of \ndefining the main pillars of the post-2015 development \nagenda. The scope of those challenges, linked to this \nimportant moment for humankind, requires that our \nStates adopt appropriate strategies and measures with \na view to assuring a good transition and calmly facing \nthe expected global transformation.\n\nThe theme of this session \u2014 \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d \u2014 provides an opportunity to deepen the \ndiscussion already begun during the previous session \nwith a view to establishing a common vision on the \nways and means to strengthen our commitment and \nour actions for sustainable and inclusive growth. It \nis therefore our mission to work towards inclusive \ndevelopment for present and future generations, given \nthe many challenges faced by our people, particularly \nin the areas of education, health, the fight against \npoverty and extreme poverty, energy, climate change \nand endemic poverty.\n\nWith that in mind, the Government of Senegal has \nresolutely moved towards a model whose goal is the \ncreation of wealth and structural transformation of its \neconomy. That is why we have adopted the Emerging \nSenegal Plan, which is, and for the next few years will \nbe, the reference point for Senegal\u2019s economic and social \npolicies. Emerging Senegal is backed by a progressive \ndynamic that is firmly oriented towards sustainable and \ninclusive development.\n\nIn the light of all of the above, we need to understand \nthe importance of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment, whose Steering Committee, led by the \nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, deserves to be \nfurther supported and promoted, given its goals relating \nto poverty eradication and infrastructure development \n\nin Africa and the structural transformation of African \neconomies. \n\nAt this very moment, as we consider the issue \nof sustainable development, the world continues to \nbe confronted with terrorism and various crises and \nconflicts that are just as dangerous for international \npeace and security. The Sahel and West Africa are \nfaced with recurring threats from terrorist groups \nwhose criminal actions undermine the foundations of \nour society and hinder our development efforts. We are \npleased by the Security Council\u2019s adoption yesterday \nof resolution 2178 (2014), a strong resolution against \nterrorism.\n\nWith regard to our subregion, our immediate \nneighbours in general and Guinea-Bissau in particular, \nSenegal would like to welcome the democratic process \nthat led to the election of President Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz. I urge \nthe international community to support that fraternal \ncountry, with its enormous potential, including through \na donors round table. \n\nSimilarly, the efforts of the international community \nto help stabilize the Central Africa region are \nhampered by the arduous process of the disarmament, \ndemobilization and reintegration of the main militias \nand armed groups, while the Horn of Africa, on top \nof terrorism, is still severely affected by the scope of \nconflicts with disastrous humanitarian consequences. \n\nAnother part of Africa is suffering the effects of \na scourge \u2014 rather, I should say a catastrophe \u2014 and \nthat is the haemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola \nvirus. It certainly affects West Africa but is also a \ngenuine threat to the entire world. We are pleased \nby the Security Council\u2019s adoption by consensus of \nresolution 2177 (2014), which was sponsored by 134 \ncountries, including Senegal, and by the high-level \nmeeting organized by the Secretary-General this very \nmorning, which was a resounding success. The decision \nto establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola \nEmergency Response has reassured our country that \nthe international community is aware of the scourge \nand that Ebola is not only an African matter but one \nthat affects the entire world. \n\nThat is why Senegal calls on the international \ncommunity to take swift action to provide the necessary \nsupport not only to the countries affected by the virus, \nbut to those of the entire West African region exposed \nto the ravages of this epidemic. The sooner we take \naction, the better we can control the epidemic. As for \nSenegal, we have set up a secure humanitarian corridor \nas a sign of solidarity with the brotherly countries that \nhave been struck by the disease.\n\nFurthermore, concerning another important issue, \nthat of Western Sahara, my country reaffirms its \ncommitment to strengthening the historic fraternal ties \namong all of the countries of the Maghreb and Africa \nin general. With that in mind, all forms of separatism \nmust be discouraged. In that regard, Senegal would \nlike to reiterate its support to Morocco\u2019s initiative to \ngrant broad autonomy to Western Sahara in the context \nof respect for its sovereignty and for the relevant \nresolutions of the Security Council, for the sake of \ndurable peace in the region. \n\nFaced with all of those pressing challenges, my \ndelegation is convinced of the urgent need to establish \na holistic approach that can enhance the resilience of \ncountries facing recurrent crises and emerging new \nconflicts. From that perspective, a body such as the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has, as part of its \nmandate, a significant role to play in re-establishing \npeace. Therefore, I would like to acknowledge here the \ndistinctive honour recently bestowed on Senegal, via \nthe person of Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice, who \nis the single African candidate standing in the election \nfor the position of President of the Assembly of States \nParties to the ICC, scheduled to take place in December.\n\nIn any event, Senegal remains committed to its \nirreversible path in favour of peace and international \nsecurity. It will continue to provide, with commitment \nand determination, its contribution to peacekeeping \noperations, while stressing the deployment of high-\nquality personnel, whenever it is requested and within \nits capacities. \n\nFor a global solution to crises, we believe that in \naddition to policies addressing the issues, conditions \nmust be conducive to restoring the economic capacities \nof countries affected by conflict. It is also urgent to \nstrengthen cooperation and refine our prevention \nstrategies to better cope with the escalating violence \nand new forms of conflict related to the spread of \ninternational terrorism.\n\nThe thorny issue of the Palestinian conflict comes \nto mind. In that connection, Senegal welcomes the \nceasefire of recent months. In its capacity as Chairman \nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \nRights of the Palestinian People, Senegal reiterates its \ncall to revive the peace process and put an end to the \n\nblockade that has been suffocating Gaza since 2007. In \nthis International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian \nPeople, Senegal renews its support for a just, peaceful \nand negotiated solution as the only option capable \nof ending the conflict and achieving the creation of \na viable, independent Palestinian State with East \nJerusalem as its capital, living side by side with Israel \nwithin secure, internationally recognized borders.\n\nParadoxically, the acuteness of the current crises \nis symptomatic of the status quo that continues to bog \ndown the process of Security Council reform. I hope that \nthe upcoming celebration of the seventieth anniversary \nof our common Organization in 2015 will mark the start \nof a reformed and renovated Security Council. Senegal \ncommends the French initiative to suspend the right of \nthe veto in cases of mass crimes.\n\nAlso during the Assembly\u2019s seventieth session, \nnon-permanent members of the Security Council will \nbe elected for the 2016-2017 term. As a candidate, \nSenegal wishes to request from this rostrum the support \nof all Member States for its election next year to a \nnon-permanent seat on the Council, 25 years after its \nlast term on the Council.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin by \ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, \nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-ninth session. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. John Ashe \nfor his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession, and to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor his continued efforts to promote peace, security and \ndevelopment throughout the world.\n\nDominica is among six small independent States in \nthe Caribbean that, together with three non-independent \nsmall island territories, constitute the Organization of \nEastern Caribbean States (OECS). The OECS States are \nnot simply small island developing States (SIDS), they \nare very small island developing States, and therefore \namong the most vulnerable members of the United \nNations family. Twenty years after the adoption of the \nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, and \n10 years after the approval of the Mauritius Strategy \nfor Implementation, most of the commitments made \nto promote sustainable development in SIDS have yet \nto be delivered. However, we remain hopeful that the \nrecently concluded third United Nations Conference on \nSmall Island Developing States, held in Apia, Samoa, \nwill have been a watershed moment for SIDS. We \nexpect the draft outcome document of the Conference \n(A/CONF. 223/3) to create a new basis on which to \naddress the implementation gaps that continue to \nstymie any movement towards sustainable development \nin SIDS.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the \nGovernment and people of Samoa on hosting a major \ninternational conference. Their tenacity, determination \nand commitment are a demonstration of what can be \nachieved by SIDS, despite the many challenges they face. \nOne major outcome of the Samoa Conference was the \nhistoric establishment of an all-SIDS \u2014 that is, SIDS-\nSIDS \u2014 initiative aimed at creating an international \norganization to serve as a platform for the development \nof sustainable energy in SIDS, known as SIDS DOCK. \nOn 1 September, a treaty formally establishing SIDS \nDOCK as an international organization was opened for \nsignature. Twenty of the 30 members of the Alliance \nof Small Island States have signed on to the treaty. As \nChair of the SIDS DOCK Steering Committee, the \nGovernment of Dominica wishes to thank the host \ncountry, Samoa, the other Member States that are \nsignatories to the treaty, our partners \u2014 Denmark, \nJapan, the United Nations Development Programme, the \nWorld Bank, the United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization, the Clinton Foundation, the secretariat \nof the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, the \nCaribbean Community Climate Change Centre \u2014 and \nthe SIDS DOCK secretariat and all the volunteers for \nmaking that historic event possible.\n\nUnfortunately, the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and the post-2015 agenda have not progressed \nat a pace that those of us in the SIDS group would have \nliked. Almost 15 years since the Millennium Declaration \nwas adopted (resolution 55/2), only a few countries \nin the developing world have registered tangible \ngains. The majority continue to wait for the promised \nimprovements in their living conditions. Nonetheless, \nDominica has been able to meet most of the MDGs, \nnotably in reducing poverty, improving access to \neducation, ensuring environmental sustainability and \nbuilding strong bilateral and multilateral partnerships. \nOur progress in poverty reduction has been noted by \nthe Caribbean Development Bank, which stated in its \n2009 report on Dominica that\n\n\u201cthe level of poverty in Dominica has fallen from \n39 per cent in 2003 to 28.8 per cent in 2009. \nAbsolute poverty, as measured by the indigence \nrate, has also declined from 10 per cent in 2003 to \n3.1 per cent in 2009.\u201d\nOur achievements in education have also surpassed \nthe targets set by the MDGs. Recognizing the \nimportance of education to our development agenda, \nDominica continues to make major investments in \nimproving access to quality education for our people. \nTo date, we can boast of universal access to education \nat the early childhood, primary and secondary levels, \nand access to post-secondary education is available to \nall secondary-school graduates.\n\nDominica has always been guided by the principle \nof the sustainable use of its natural resources and \nthe protection of its physical environment. For those \nreasons, Dominica has been called the \u201cNature Island \nof the Caribbean\u201d. We therefore have much that we can \nshare with the United Nations family on the subject of \nthe sustainable use of natural resources. In our efforts \nto protect and ensure environmental sustainability \nand to rid our country of its reliance on fossil fuels for \ngenerating electricity, the Government of Dominica has \ninvested, and continues to invest, in renewable energy. \n\nToday about 20 per cent of the island\u2019s electricity needs \nare met from \u201cclean\u201d hydropower.\n\nAdditionally, however, the Government has been \npursuing the development of the country\u2019s geothermal \nresources. To date, the Government has invested \nover $20 million in geothermal development. The \nfirst production and reinjection wells have been \ncompleted, and the results of the flow tests indicate \nthat the geothermal reservoir has a capacity to generate \nsufficient electricity for domestic consumption and \nfor export to the neighbouring French territories of \nMartinique and Guadeloupe. The first plant for purely \ndomestic consumption is expected to be commissioned \nin 2016.\n\nDominica\u2019s development achievements in general, \nand the attainment of the MDGs in particular, have \nbeen realized through the strong, visionary and \ncompassionate leadership of Prime Minister Roosevelt \nSkerrit and his Cabinet, complemented by our hard-\nworking citizens and the kind cooperation of our \ndevelopment partners. Our partnerships with the \nEuropean Union, the United States of America, Japan \nand other developed countries have all contributed \nsignificantly to the progress we have been able to make \nthus far. The recent approval by the World Bank of the \nPilot Programme for Climate Resilience, which will \nundertake a number of infrastructure projects designed \nto transform Dominica into a climate-resilient and low-\ncarbon developing country and is expected, among other \nbenefits, to positively impact agricultural productivity \nand food security in our rural communities.\n\nSouth-South cooperation with partners from \ndeveloping countries, notably the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Cuba, Morocco and Venezuela, and from the \nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, has \nbeen able to complement the decreasing assistance from \ntraditional partners. We embrace all our development \npartners and look forward to the deepening and \nstrengthening of our partnerships for the benefits of all \nour people.\n\nIn spite of those achievements, we are a long \nway from where we aspire to be. The spectre of the \ndeadly Ebola disease and the scourges of HIV/AIDS \nand non-communicable diseases has the potential \nto significantly impact our people and threaten the \ngains made so far by small island developing States. \nTherefore, that myriad of challenges calls for collective \nglobal action to protect the gains that small island \nStates like Dominica have been able to achieve over the \npast two decades and to lay a path for development that \nis sustainable and people-focused.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of climate change remains \nan existential threat to the people throughout the world \nwho call small island States their homes. The location, \nlevel of development and vulnerability of our islands \nmake them very susceptible to the impact of climate \nchange. Very often, we refer to climate change and its \neffects as a phenomenon that is to impact our global \ncommunity at some future date. The unfortunate \nreality is that SIDS have already been suffering from \nthe impact of climate change. The increasing severity \nof storms and hurricanes is becoming more prevalent, \nand with every strike the extreme weather claims lives \nand threatens our development efforts. According to a \n2008 publication by the United States National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, the Caribbean has \nthe second-greatest risk of hurricanes in the world. \nThe report also highlights the increased frequency of \ntropical cyclones in our region.\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean are also prone to \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, torrential \nrains with accompanying landslides and flash \nflooding. We in the Caribbean have therefore been on \nthe receiving end of the impact of climate change for \ndecades. A case in point is the impact of Hurricane \nIvan, a category-3 system that devastated the island of \nGrenada on 7 September 2004. Hurricane Ivan exposed \nthe vulnerability that is inherent in SIDS. Twenty-\neight lives were lost and 18,000 people were left \nwithout shelter, food or belongings. A post-Ivan study \nconducted by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean \nStates reported that:\n\n\u201cThe macro-economic assessment of the damages \ncaused by Hurricane Ivan, which wreaked havoc \non Grenada, inflicted damages totalling $1 billion, \nmore than twice the value of that country\u2019s GDP\u201d.\nIn more recent times, on 24 December 2013, a time \noutside the traditional hurricane season, the Caribbean \nislands of Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent \nand the Grenadines were severely affected by a trough \nsystem that brought with it heavy rains and high \nwinds. That slow-moving weather system left behind \napproximately $128 million worth of direct damage. \nWithin less than 12 hours, each of those countries \nsuffered significant loss: Dominica \u2014 $17 million, or \n3.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP); Saint \n\nLucia \u2014 $19 million, or 1.4 per cent of GDP; and Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines \u2014 $93 million, or 12.8 per \ncent. The indirect impacts, which include the loss of \nagricultural production and interruptions in other \neconomic activities, such as tourism, would increase \nthe overall effect significantly. The most devastating \nhurricane to hit Dominica in living memory was \nHurricane David, on 29 August 1979, a category-5 \nhurricane that left the island devastated as if by war, \nresulting in 43 deaths and with all public utilities, \ninfrastructure, 60 per cent of homes, roads and sea \ndefences totally destroyed.\n\nSuch natural disasters affect the daily lives of our \npeople and significantly retard our efforts to bring \nabout social and economic development. We therefore \ncall on all States Members of the United Nations to \ntake immediate actions to approve a legally binding \nagreement to reduce the impact of climate change. The \nclimate change agenda must be an integral part of the \npost-2015 agenda.\n\nThe creation of wealth and the generation of \neconomic growth are essential for the eradication of \npoverty and the improvement of the quality of life of our \npeople. However, economic growth and development \nshould be inclusive and sustainable. The creation of \njobs and the delivery of social services should touch \nthe lives of all our people, especially the indigenous \npeople, the elderly, the disadvantaged, the disabled, the \nvulnerable, and those people who are excluded from \nmainstream society. The development of agriculture, \ntourism, the energy sector and industry should therefore \nbe inclusive and sustainable.\n\nDominica therefore joins the rest of the Caribbean \nCommunity in calling for development partners to \nconduct their macroeconomic and trade policies in a \nway that facilitates opportunities for SIDS to promote \neconomic growth, shrink existing income gaps, reduce \nthe levels of poverty and achieve their development \naspirations. Those policies should include, but not be \nlimited to, a change in the criteria for the graduation \nof SIDS from preferential access to multilateral \nconcessionary financing. The new criteria must take \ninto account the inherent vulnerabilities of SIDS \nand the need for building resilience to the impact of \nclimate change and the vagaries of the global financial, \neconomic and trading systems. Therefore, any measure \nthat inhibits any State Member of the United Nations \nfamily from becoming fully integrated into the global \nfinancial and trading system should be removed.\n\nIn that vein, the economic embargo against our \nbrothers and sisters in Cuba continues to be of concern \nto us in the Caribbean. That unilateral action by the \nUnited States of America against our sister Caribbean \nisland, whatever the excuses might have been 55 years \nago, cannot be justified today, nor can the suffering \nof our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Cuba, \nas a result of their exclusion for 55 years from the \nworld banking and trading system, be defended. It is \nwell established that, whatever the objectives were 55 \nyears ago, they are not likely to be achieved through \nthe continuation of the embargo. The Government of \nDominica therefore calls on the United States to heed \nthe call of the General Assembly to lift the embargo \nagainst Cuba and to support the full integration of the \nCuban people into the global financial and trading \nsystems.\n\nThe embargo notwithstanding, the Cuban people \ncontinue to make a tremendous contribution to human \ndevelopment across the globe. For decades, Cuba has \nbeen training doctors, nurses, engineers and other \nprofessionals, deploying them to provide technical \nassistance to developing countries as part of its South-\nSouth cooperation. Cuba also offers professional \ntraining in various disciplines to thousands of students \nfrom all over the developing world.\n\nCuba continues to add its voice in the fight against \nterrorism and drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the \nrest of the world. It is for that reason that Dominica \nfails to comprehend the continued listing of Cuba as \na State sponsor of terrorism. We therefore call for the \nremoval of Cuba from the list of countries that sponsor \nterrorism. Our efforts in the region should be focused \ninstead on combating the real threats to global peace \nand security.\n\nSimilarly, the events unfolding in Ukraine are \na proxy tug-of-war between the European Union and \nthe United States, on the one hand, and the Russian \nFederation, on the other. The Ukrainian people are the \nvictims of the contest, which is a throwback to the Cold \nWar.\n\nThe United Kingdom, when confronted with the \nquestion of Irish nationalism in 1918, resolved the \nmatter through the ballot box with a county-by-county \nreferendum on the future of Ireland. Most counties opted \nfor independence, but five counties opted for continued \nunion with the United Kingdom. Three years later, \nthe island was partitioned into the Republic of Ireland \n\nand Northern Ireland, the latter remaining part of the \nUnited Kingdom. The United Kingdom currently faces \nthe question of Scottish independence. Once again, \nonly last week on 18 September, the United Kingdom \nresorted to the ballot box to decide the matter. While the \nsupporters of the campaign in favour of independence \nwill be disappointed by the results, the real victors are \nnot the supporters of the campaign for continued union \nwith the United Kingdom but democracy itself.\n\nWith that experience, the United Kingdom is \nuniquely placed to counsel the European Union, the \nUnited States, Kyiv and Moscow about how to grant \nthe people of Ukraine the same opportunity to decide \ntheir destiny for themselves, according to their regional \npreferences and without coercion either from the East \nor from the West. Such an approach would end the \nparalysis in the Security Council, thereby creating a \nreal partnership among the United States, the Russian \nFederation and China and enabling the United Nations \nto fulfil its mandate to assist in conflict resolution, \ncombat the greatest threats facing the world today, \nnamely, armed conflict and terrorism, and create a \nmore peaceful international community.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate to the General \nAssembly that the impact of climate change is a \nmajor threat to the development efforts and to the \nvery existence of small island developing States. The \nincidence of severe weather conditions, including \ncoastal erosion and sea-level rise, continues to impact \nisland States in the worst ways possible. Our ability \nto survive depends not only on the individual and \ncollective actions taken by SIDS, but also on the actions \nof the rest of the international community.\n\nA legally binding outcome to the climate change \nnegotiations is a critical component in a series of \nactions to be taken by Member States. That should be \nbuttressed by a post-2015 agenda that includes poverty \neradication, increased access to education and training, \nhealth care, potable water and sanitation, and promotes \nsustainable and inclusive economic development.\n\nThe outcomes of the third United Nations \nConference on SIDS in Samoa should serve as a blueprint \nfor the growth and development of SIDS. That should \ninclude the restructuring of the international financial \nand trading architecture so that the vulnerabilities and \nspecial circumstances of SIDS are taken into account. \nThat new configuration will allow for the development \nof SIDS through sustainable agriculture, tourism \nand inclusive industrial development. However, such \nefforts must be propelled by sustainable energy that \nmaximizes the use of renewable SIDS-appropriate \nenergy resources in the most energy efficient manner.\n\nFinally, I wish all participants in this sixty-ninth \nsession every success in their deliberations.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin, Sir, by \nexpressing the best wishes of the Government and the \npeople of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Mr. Kutesa\u2019s \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. His election is a fitting \ntribute to his invaluable and inspiring contribution to \ninternational diplomacy. I would also like to express \nmy warm appreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador \nJohn Ashe, for the astute and steadfast manner in which \nhe steered the affairs of the sixty-eighth session of the \nAssembly. I thank Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon not \nonly for his relentless commitment to the work of the \nUnited Nations, but especially for his tireless efforts \nto address the challenges of world peace and security.\n\nWe are meeting at a time when the world looks with \nexpectation towards 2015, which marks the end of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the launch \nof their successors, the sustainable development goals \n(SDGs). We must ensure, at all levels, that the SDGs \nreflect the goals and aspirations of all the regions of the \nworld. Indeed, if the SDGs are to drive development and \nalso meet the aspirations of developing countries for \npoverty elimination and sustainable growth, collective \nownership of the emerging process must be our \npriority. We in Africa expect that the new SDGs will be \npeople-centred. They must promote peace and security, \nstructural economic transformation, inclusive growth, \nfood security for all, environmental sustainability and \nthe shared benefits of science and technology. Indeed, \n\nthe gains of the MDGs must be incorporated into the \nemerging mechanism.\n\nWe applaud the wide-ranging recommendations \nof the report of the Intergovernmental Committee \nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing \non domestic resource mobilization, international \ndevelopment assistance, private sector finance and a \nsupportive global enabling environment. My country is \nhonoured to have been accorded the privilege, jointly \nwith Finland, of leading that work as co-Chair of the \nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts, as mandated \nby the Heads of State and Government at the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in \nRio. Along with the work of the Open Working Group \non sustainable development goals, the report provides \na solid basis for intergovernmental negotiations on the \npost-2015 development agenda. Nigeria is aware of \nthe need to create an enabling environment for rapid \ndevelopment. We are committed to strengthening \ninstitutions and improving governance systems, in \norder to ensure an efficient use of resources and the \nprocess itself.\n\n\nThe year 2015 also marks the seventieth anniversary \nof the establishment of the United Nations. Even \nthough the Charter of the United Nations underlines \nthe imperative to spare succeeding generations from \nthe scourge of war, the world continues to witness the \nravages of war and human suffering. Today\u2019s terrorism, \nmanifested sometimes in insurgency, is vicious and \naimless. Its consequences are agonizing, marked \nby a tendency to annihilate victims and completely \ndestroy infrastructure and properties. The involvement \nof foreign fighters remains a common feature of \nterrorist groups, whether Al-Qaida in the Maghreb, \nAl-Shabaab in Somalia, Boko Haram in Nigeria or the \nnewly emerging Islamic State (IS). The new dimension \nintroduced by IS \u2014 namely, the goal of conquering \nterritory and establishing its destructive ideology \u2014 is \na major challenge that must be collectively halted before \nit becomes the norm. That challenge focuses renewed \nattention on the need to review the existing tools for \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe violent and criminal activities of Boko \nHaram have continued to pose a potent challenge to \nthe Government and people of Nigeria. Through a \nwave of terror, assassinations, bombings and now \nabductions and kidnappings, predominantly in the \nnorth-east of the country, Boko Haram is attempting \nto truncate development in those areas through murder \nand mayhem. In April, our innocent daughters were \nabducted from a secondary school in Chibok, in the \nnorth-east. That callous and criminal act has attracted \nempathy for Nigeria across the globe.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all \nthe countries and organizations that have expressed \nsolidarity with us and have continued to support our \ndetermined efforts to free our daughters. Although it \nhas been over three months since they were abducted, \nwe have never relented in our efforts to see them safely \nfree. Together with our partners, we are working \nassiduously to free our daughters and reunite them \nwith their families. To that end, I wish to thank the \nGovernment of France for organizing and hosting the \nspecial summit on security in Nigeria that was held in \nParis in May. I also wish to express my appreciation \nto the Governments of Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and \nGuinea for their committed efforts in support of the \nfight against Boko Haram. The outcome of the French \nprocess and the follow-up in London, Washington, D.C., \nand Abuja have helped to galvanize regional action and \nare already yielding positive results. Let me underline \ntoday that we shall not waver until we end this mindless \nwar on the innocent and bring all the perpetrators to \njustice. We will triumph over terrorism.\n\nThe failure of the Security Council to agree on \nunanimous action over pressing challenges to global \npeace and security in Syria and Iraq and the conflict in \nUkraine, as well as with regard to the renewed aggression \nbetween Israel and Palestine, has strengthened the case \nfor Security Council reform. Today\u2019s challenges can \nbe resolved only by a Security Council whose working \nmethods engender transparency, inclusivity and \ncommon ownership through equitable representation \nof all regions in the decision-making process. It is \nimperative that we take advantage of 2015, which also \nmarks the fiftieth anniversary of the 1965 reform, to \nmake concrete progress on reforming the Security \nCouncil. We believe that there needs to be a fast-track \nprocess in line with the initiative of Mr. John Ashe, \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession, for establishing a working group on reform. \nIndeed, the Security Council requires the collective \nresolve of all Member States to ensure that 2015 brings \ndecisive progress.\n\nEven as Africa, and in particular West Africa, \nbattles conflicts and terrorism, with progressive \n\n\nresults, the region is being devastated by the outbreak \nof the deadly Ebola virus. While Nigeria was able to \nrespond effectively to control the spread of the disease, \nthe situation in Liberia and Sierra Leone requires \nsustainable collective global action if it is to be \ncontained. Through the concerted efforts of our health-\ncare professionals, the World Health Organization and \nour international partners, we have been able to contain \nthe virus, and we can confidently say that Nigeria today \nis Ebola-free.\n\nHowever, we have continued to support efforts \nto contain the spread of the disease in Sierra Leone, \nLiberia and Guinea. In addition to a direct donation \ntotalling $3.5 million, we have provided training and \ncapacity-building support to the three countries. It \nis pertinent to stress the need for the international \ncommunity to properly appreciate the magnitude of \nthe Ebola challenge. Indulging in isolationist and \ndiscriminatory tendencies, as some countries are doing, \nwill only worsen an already critical situation. To prevent \nthe disease from becoming a global catastrophe, the \nUnited Nations must accord it the maximum priority \nit deserves.\n\nCertainly, there has been much discussion on \nlimiting ozone layer depletion since the commencement \nof negotiations under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change in 1994. However, the \nextent of progress in key areas, particularly in limiting \nthe contribution of man-made activities to greenhouse \ngas emission, has yet to be determined.\n\nNigeria appreciates the indispensable role of the \nUnited Nations in its search for solutions to all those \nchallenges: terrorism, global peace and security, \nthe environment, and forging sustainable economic \ndevelopment. We have been and will remain a reliable \nand active partner, especially as we collectively work \nto resolve the new and emerging threats to global peace \nand security. The world must come together and win the \nwar against terror.\n\nOn 29 May 1999, Nigeria ended its military rule after \nthe inauguration of a democratically elected President. \nCome February 2015, the country will conduct its fifth \npost-military-rule general election. In keeping with \nmy election as President by the people of Nigeria, we \nshall conduct elections based on global best practices to \nfurther strengthen our democratic institutions.\n"

        "file_text": "This year marks \nthe 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First \nWorld War. Yet in today\u2019s world we are far from having \nachieved global peace. It therefore remains a major task \nfor the international community to achieve it. But that \nis not the only task that remains. In order to achieve \nglobal peace we also have to tackle two other equally \nimportant challenges, namely, to preserve global human \ndignity, and global prosperity.\n\nI would like to start with global security. Europe is \nthe continent that gave birth to the two most disastrous \nconflicts in human history. We Europeans have \nlearned our lesson. A large part of our continent has \nbeen spared violent conflicts for almost 70 years. My \ncountry celebrates 25 years since our return to freedom \nand democracy in 1989.\n\nYet even today a part of Europe is at war. The \nterritorial integrity of Ukraine, guaranteed by the \nCharter of the United Nations and the Budapest \nMemorandum of 1994, was violated by the Russian \nannexation of Crimea and the activities of Russian-\nbacked paramilitary separatist forces in eastern \nUkraine. Despite the present armistice, we believe \nthat it is still the responsibility of the international \ncommunity to seek the de-escalation of a conflict that \nhas caused enormous suffering to the people of Ukraine \nand the loss of innocent lives of Ukrainians and other \npeople, as demonstrated by the downing of Malaysia \nAirlines Flight MH-17.\n\nThat is not all. We are alarmed at the continuing \naggravation of the security situation in northern Iraq. \nWe condemn the brutal acts of violence committed \nby the so-called Islamic State against local ethnic \nand religious minorities, as well as the murders of \ntwo innocent journalists and a humanitarian activist. \nThose acts constitute war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. As we are currently seeing in Iraq, terrorism \nhas taken on a new dimension, and we must counter it \nwith the utmost determination. Therefore, we welcome \nPresident Obama\u2019s strategy as well as other important \ninternational activities in that regard, including the \nSecurity Council summit on foreign terrorist fighters \n(see S/PV.7272).\n\nWith regard to Syria, we believe that the only way \nto achieve a stable peace in that war-torn country and \nto ensure much-needed safety and legitimate rights \nfor all Syrian people is through a negotiated political \nsettlement between the Syrian Government and the \ndemocratic opposition. The Czech Republic, appalled \nby the atrocities committed by the so-called Islamic \nState, urges all sides of the conflict in Syria to cease \nviolence and to start cooperating with the new United \nNations Special Envoy in order to find a lasting solution.\n\nMoreover, we must not omit the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict. We remain deeply concerned about the \nhumanitarian consequences of the conflict in the Gaza \nStrip. We have made an effort to provide assistance to \nthe victims through humanitarian aid. However, first \nand foremost, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have \nto make every effort, with the help of the international \ncommunity, to renew genuine and comprehensive \nnegotiations. That is the only way to reach a lasting \nsolution that would bring about peace, dignity, security \nand prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nBut there is also something else: the global dignity \nof human beings. In speaking of acts of violence \u2014 and \nthe list I have provided is far from being exhaustive \u2014 we \nmust keep looking for the causes behind those acts \nand seek to eliminate them. We often see that such \nacts result from despair and from a lack of the basic \nneeds necessary to ensure human dignity, needs \nsuch as physical integrity, access to justice, political \nparticipation and basic freedoms, and also food, water, \nmedical care, education, tolerable working conditions \nand protection against discrimination on various \ngrounds. It is the responsibility of the international \ncommunity, represented by the United Nations, to \nensure that human dignity remains not only a declared \nprinciple of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nbut is also put into practice worldwide. I am proud that \nmy country can contribute to those efforts, building on \nthe humanist legacy of my great compatriots, the first \nCzechoslovak President, Tom\u00e1. Garrigue Masaryk, and \nthe first President of the Czech Republic, V\u00e1clav Havel.\n\nThe first precondition for human dignity is the \npossibility of enjoying life without threats to one\u2019s \nphysical integrity and physical suffering. For that \nreason the Czech Republic has vigorously supported \nthe concept of the responsibility to protect, with its \nstrong dimension of prevention and capacity-building. \nYet, when a conflict cannot be prevented for various \nreasons, the United Nations is ultimately responsible, \nthrough its peacekeeping role, for preventing the \nfurther deterioration of the situation, loss of life and \nhuman suffering. The Czech Republic has consistently \nparticipated in various European Union (EU) missions \ncomplementing United Nations peacekeeping efforts, \nnamely, in the EU Training Mission in Mali and in the \nMultinational Force and Observers mission in Sinai. I \ncan assure members that we will remain involved in the \nfuture.\n\nNational States and the international community \nshare responsibility for protecting people from atrocities. \nHowever, if they fail, it is necessary to establish \naccountability for serious violations of international \nhumanitarian law and human rights. The Czech \nRepublic continues firmly to support international \ncriminal justice and the International Criminal Court. \nOur primary task is to combat impunity and to enforce \nthe protection of civilians and vulnerable groups in \narmed conflicts.\n\nIt is a sad reality that in too many parts of the \nworld women are among the most vulnerable groups. \nWe continue to witness horrifying cases of violence \nagainst women and girls, including sexual violence. We \ncall on all States to adopt urgent measures to prevent \nsuch abhorrent incidents. When women are excluded \nfrom society and prevented from enjoying basic \nrights, participating in public life or simply exercising \na profession, it has a massive impact not only on the \ncountry\u2019s development but also on its overall stability. \nWe expect the relevant United Nations bodies to step up \ntheir efforts to ensure a peaceful and dignified life for \nall, including women.\n\nIn order to reinforce the prevention of various \ntypes of conflicts, we fully support the Rights Up \nFront initiative launched by the Secretary-General. We \nunderstand that it is an appeal to the United Nations and \nits bodies and to Member States to ensure respect for \nhuman rights, good governance, fair and free elections \nand genuine participation in decision-making without \ndiscrimination. The Czech Republic, as a member \nof the Human Rights Council, has for the second \ntime presented a consensual resolution on political \nparticipation. In our view, giving everybody a chance \nto enjoy their civil and political rights through such \nparticipation is essential for building inclusive and \ntruly cohesive societies.\n\nA life of peace and dignity is unthinkable without \nthe enjoyment of economic, social and environmental \nrights. That can be achieved by fighting poverty, social \n\n\nexclusion and all forms of discrimination and illiteracy. \nI am convinced that the Czech Republic has a lot to \noffer in that respect. We are among the countries with \nthe most equal distribution of wealth in the world. We \nare also a country with one of the lowest risks of falling \ninto poverty in the world. We have managed to maintain \na socially cohesive society, and we believe that that is \none reason why our society is free of serious tensions \nresulting in violent conflicts. We want to contribute our \nexperience to the efforts of the international community \nin order to build fair and prosperous societies across the \nplanet.\n\nThe key to building a fair society is sustainable \ndevelopment. To that end, we are committed to \nworking on a post-2015 development agenda that will \nformulate sustainable development goals based on the \n2000 Millennium Development Goals. The goals will \nbe global in nature, universally applicable and will \naddress persistent inequalities and new challenges \nfacing people and our planet. The promotion of good \ngovernance, the rule of law, human rights and the \nempowerment of women must remain among the \nstand-alone priorities, but they are also cross-cutting \nissues linking various agendas. In that context, we look \nforward to the Secretary-General\u2019s synthesis report \nexpected by the end of the year.\n\nThe Czech Republic expects that the sustainable \ndevelopment goals will have a true impact on the \nfashioning of a development policy that will correspond \nto the needs of present generations and improve their \nquality of life, but will not compromise the ability \nof future generations to meet their own needs. All \ncountries, rich and poor, should therefore be committed \nto creating an economically viable yet more socially \nand environmentally sustainable future. We hope to be \nable to take part in that effort through our membership \nin the Economic and Social Council, to which we are \ncandidates for membership starting in 2016.\n\nWe are also actively involved in the EU and the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, and we are ready to support all the proposals \nand solutions that are considered most effective to \nreach the new global climate agreement, hopefully to \nbe concluded in Paris in 2015.\n\nI began by recalling the First World War and continued \nby enumerating three major challenges \u2014 global peace, \nglobal human dignity and global prosperity. They are \nenormous challenges. The United Nations has done \nimpressive work in fostering peace, human dignity \nand sustainable development. I am confident that next \nyear, when we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \nof the Charter of the United Nations, we will have an \nopportunity not only to reflect honestly on where we \ncould do better, but also to appreciate the progress that \nwe have made together.\n"

It is an honour for me to speak before \nthe General Assembly, convened for nearly 70 years, \nto address key issues of justice, universal peace and \nsecurity.\n\nI take this opportunity to send Mr. Sam Kutesa \nmy warmest congratulations on his election as the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. His proven experience on international issues \nand the United Nations system is a guarantee of the \nsuccess of the work that will be taken up at this session. \nHe can be assured of the full cooperation of the Haitian \ndelegation.\n\nI commend the remarkable work of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. I pay special tribute to him \nfor his courage and commitment to the cause of peace \nworldwide. As humanitarian crises and conflicts \nbetween States threaten the stability and security of \npeoples of the world, the Secretary-General\u2019s leadership \nhas repeatedly demonstrated that there is always a \nway to resolve our differences through dialogue, \nunderstanding and mutual respect.\n\nThat is why I encourage the United Nations to \ncontinue to support the good relations between the \nparties on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the \npeaceful and constructive approaches to establish \nlasting peace in East Asia and the East China Sea.\n\nWe in the Caribbean have chosen to take the path \nof dialogue with our neighbour to the east for the good \nof our two peoples and in order to preserve peace in \nthe region. We believe in the power of dialogue. We \nare convinced that it is always necessary to engage \nin negotiation and productive discussions. We readily \nagreed to come to the negotiating table with our friends \nfrom the Dominican Republic to set out the real problens \nof mutual interest for the benefit of our two peoples \nand to resolve half-century-old misunderstandings. We \nwelcome the fact that a number of agreements have \nbeen reached on issues that were not always easy to \nresolve. We hope to be able to continue on that path \ntowards a better understanding between two States that \nshare the same island.\n\nDespite a challenging route, 70 years later it is clear \nthat this common project that is the United Nations has \nlost nothing of its topicality and relevance. At a time when \nhotbeds of international tension persist, the enlightened \nPowers of our planet must unite to preserve peace, \ndemocracy, stability, human rights and development. \nIn that context, in line with the new realities of this \ncentury, Haiti argues strongly for concrete progress in \nthe negotiations for United Nations reform, particularly \nwith regard to the enlargement of the Security Council \nto include new permanent members.\n\nThe example of inclusion must begin where the \nright to participation is a fundamental right expressed \nthrough the Charter of the United Nations. Our voice \ncounts. Our leadership, being responsible, must be \nexpressed through concrete and tangible actions when \npeace, the health of our environment and the health of \nour people are threatened. In that connection, I wish to \npay tribute to our Cuban brothers, among other peoples \nof the world, who have supported African countries \naffected by Ebola.\n\nAs much as we have a moral responsibility to raise \nour voice against injustice whatever its origin, against \nfanaticism, to reject repression and violence in all its \nforms and to fight discrimination and prejudices that \nhinder solidarity among peoples, we also have an \nobligation to recognize and encourage efforts to unite \npeople.\n\nThe legitimacy and credibility of the United \nNations depends upon its ability to act quickly and \nrespond effectively in recognizing the added value of \neach Member State. More than ever, problems must \nbe addressed pragmatically. That is an urgent matter \nin these times of political tensions on a global scale \nand of the spread of some diseases that are just as \ndevastating. Moreover, the international community \nis greatly challenged by the resurgence of a brutal and \nfanatical international terrorism in a new form. The \nUnited Nations is and remains today our best defence \nagainst those challenges through respect for the dignity \nof peoples and through the participation and inclusion \nof everyone.\n\nAllow me to present the situation in my country, \nthe Republic of Haiti.\n\nThe Haitian people are at a decisive turning point \nin their long march in search of stability, democracy \nand progress, towards the consolidation of democratic \ninstitutions established 27 years ago with the adoption \nof the 1987 Constitution. After more than two decades \npunctuated by disasters of all kinds, Haiti has made \nundeniable progress over the past three years in \n\nterms of consolidating democracy and the rule of law, \nstrengthening its institutions and protecting human \nrights, reducing poverty and laying the foundations \nfor sustained growth and long-lasting development. \nWe are aware that the road that should lead Haiti to \nsocioeconomic stability is still long. However, the \nobstacles, however daunting they may be, are not \ninsurmountable.\n\nIn terms of security, the situation has improved \nto the point where Haiti has become one of the safest \ncountries in the Caribbean. The Government has made \ngreat efforts to strengthen the professionalism of the \nHaitian National Police. I maintain and reaffirm my \nstance on the need for a gradual and orderly withdrawal \nof United Nations troops from Haitian soil. That \nprocess has in fact already commenced, along with \nthe strengthening of the operational capacity of the \nNational Police of Haiti, which will allow it to take \nover from the forces of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti.\n\nI wish to make a plea for better coordination of \nthe work of United Nations agencies with national \ninstitutions and for taking into account the real needs \nof the country.\n\nWith regard to education, 70 per cent of pupils \nin the first two years of primary school receive a \nfree education. For the first time in Haiti, 5 per \ncent of the gross domestic product is earmarked for \neducation. Today, the net school enrolment rate has \nincreased significantly. We are working hard to reach \nthe Millennium Development Goals, which are set at \n100 per cent in this regard, as the Assembly knows.\n\nIn the area of health, we have stepped up efforts to \nreduce the incidence of diseases such as AIDS, malaria \nand vector-borne diseases. The significant increase in \nhealth centres across the country has improved access \nto care and led to a reduction in maternal and infant \nmortality. Maternal mortality fell from 350 to 157 per \n100,000 live births per 100,000. Through our Ministry \nof Health, we were able to build and rehabilitate more \nthan 200 health facilities. And to strengthen governance \nin health, we are committed to the ongoing training of \nour health professionals so they can provide better care \nand services. With regard to cholera, while assuming \nour duty to our fellow citizens, Haiti calls for a decisive \ncommitment from the United Nations to contribute to \nthe National Plan for the Eradication of Cholera.\n\nWith regard to the economy, major reforms have \nbeen put in place to improve the business environment. \nThe increased flow of foreign capital and the number of \ntourists visiting our country are tangible evidence of the \nimproving business climate in Haiti. We are resolutely \nfocused on our goal of making Haiti an investment \ndestination, not a humanitarian destination.\n\nOn the political front, Haiti will conduct free, \nhonest and transparent elections as soon as possible \nfor the renewal of democratic and constitutional \ninstitutions. That is a necessary step. Democratic rules \nrequire it, and I will uphold republican principles until \nthe end. As Head of State, guarantor of the stability of \ninstitutions, I have spared no effort to find consensus \namong all parties and institutions involved in the \norganization of legislative and municipal elections. \nDespite the discrepancies, in the spirit of Jean-Jacques \nDessalines, I am confident that together we will arrive \nat such consensus. I look forward to bringing my \nfellow citizens together around the table to provide that \nharmonious area marked by the purest ideals that the \nHaitian people have established for themselves, ideals \nthat we remain firmly committed to.\n\nI would like to reiterate the support of the Republic \nof Haiti to the fight that the United Nations is leading \nto eradicate poverty. While waiting for the summit to \nbe held next year in which Member States will decide \non the post-2015 development agenda, I can already \nexpress the confidence of my Administration in the \nsustainable development goals intended to replace the \nMillennium Development Goals.\n\n\nThe world currently has enormous resources. \nOur challenge is to find effective ways and means to \nensure that they are distributed in an equitable and just \nmanner. I remain convinced that our commitment to \nreduce poverty and inequality throughout the world is \nnecessary. It is in that spirit that the Republic of Haiti \njoins the international community to contribute its part \nto meet that challenge. It is suitable, therefore, that we \nheighten the effectiveness of the Organization and give \nit the necessary and sufficient resources in the exercise \nof that mission.\n\nOur goal is for that truly to become the basis of \na system of security and collective solidarity that is \nable to ensure the rule of law and to preserve peace and \ninternational security; a system able to prioritize basic \nfreedoms and human rights; a system able to promote \nstrong growth that is careful to respect the environment \n\n\nand development that responds to current needs without \nrisking the future of generations to come. It is up to us, \non the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the Charter \nof the United Nations, to transmit that new spirit, so \nindispensable to the promotion and defense of the \nuniversal values of which we are the custodians.\n"

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of the African Union and of the Islamic Republic \nof Mauritania, I am pleased to express to you, Sir, my \nwarmest congratulations and my best wishes on the \noccasion of your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. I trust that your \ngood judgement and your competence, as well as your \nextensive experience in the diplomatic leadership of \nyour brotherly country, Uganda, constitute the best \nguarantee for the good conduct and success of the work \nof our current session.\n\nI am also pleased to point out the remarkable \nwork of your predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, during his \nleadership of the proceedings of the previous session. \nI would also like to express my warmest thanks to His \nExcellency the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his tireless efforts for international peace and \nsecurity and for his approach in support of dialogue as \nthe best way to address the current international issues.\n\nThe General Assembly has always been a forum \nfor the exchange of opinions and the discussion of \nimportant international issues that affect the lives of \nnations and people. That explains the privileged status \nthat it has gained within the different institutions of the \nUnited Nations system. This annual meeting, which \nbrings leaders together, is a valuable opportunity to \nseek a common understanding for a global vision, \nensuring proposals for efficient solutions to the current \ninternational problems that respond to the expectations \nof people around the world.\n\nIn that regard, I am pleased to address this audience \nand to present to the world, through this forum, what \nwe Africans have done in terms of achievements and \ndevelopment, the challenges facing our young continent, \nour expectations of the international community and \nour aspirations in terms of an effective contribution \nto addressing the current situation, humanity and the \nbuilding of its future.\n\nSeveral countries of the African continent have \nexperienced high levels of growth despite the severe \neconomic crisis that still prevails in the world. The \naverage growth rate in the continent has reached 5 per \ncent and is nearing 6 per cent. That economic recovery \nis the result, among other factors, of the wise economic \npolicies adopted by African Governments. The \npromotion of local and foreign investment, the building \nof new infrastructure and greater attention to the most \nvulnerable members of society have therefore been \nencouraged. Similarly, projects and income-generating \nactivities have been supported, thereby contributing \nefficiently to the reduction of unemployment, in \nparticular among young people and women. Africa is \nworking tirelessly to change from a consumption space \nto a production zone in order to ensure employment \nopportunities for millions of its people.\n\nThe achievement of food self-sufficiency, the \ndevelopment of agricultural industries and poverty \nreduction in rural areas are core objectives of the \nAfrican Union. In that regard, the agriculture and \nanimal resources sector has received great interest \nduring successive African summits. The year 2014 has \ntherefore been declared the Year of Agriculture and \nFood Security in Africa. The agriculture sector employs \nsome 60 per cent of the workforce and represents one \nthird of the gross domestic product of the continent.\n\nIn that context, the African summit recommended \nthat 10 per cent of the budget of African States be \nallocated to the development of the agriculture sector. \nAfrican Governments have recognized the importance \nof food security and adopted efficient policies for the \ndevelopment of that vital sector. Such policies have \nachieved their objectives and have enabled some \nAfrican countries to be self-sufficient in various \nagricultural products, while other countries are making \nsteady progress on that path. They, too, are therefore \nbecoming self-sufficient.\n\nIn Africa, we seek fruitful cooperation with our \npartners, thereby opening international markets to \nour agricultural products and, in that way, developing \nour capacities for agricultural research and providing \naccess to developed technologies and techniques for the \npreservation of the environment.\n\nWhen the Millennium Development Goals were \nadopted in 2000, Africa did not have a common \nvision for the major development issues. Its voice was \ntherefore not adequately heard. Despite that, we have \nworked seriously and energetically to achieve those \nGoals. Today, Africa speaks with one voice and seeks \nto promote development in order to become a healthy \n\n\nregion free of scourges, wars and conflicts, where \njustice, good governance and respect for human rights \nprevail.\n\nIn that regard, African leaders have taken important \ndecisions on core issues for the continent, including \nthe vision of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and the \npost-2015 development agenda, which focuses on the \ndevelopment of human resources and the eradication \nof poverty, epidemics and deadly diseases. It must be \npointed out that the fight against AIDS, malaria and \ntuberculosis has been strengthened through the many \nprogrammes that have helped to promote actions to \nreduce the effects of such scourges.\n\nDespite such efforts, the indicators in the health \nsector lead us to exert every effort to strengthen our \nhealth-care system, to improve access to its services and \nto develop its human resources and infrastructure. In \nthat context, African Heads of State recently launched \na strong initiative to fight AIDS. The sudden outbreak \nof the Ebola virus in West Africa constitutes a major \nchallenge owing to the rapid spread of the disease and \nthe tragic fate of its victims. The steps taken to contain \nthe spread of that scourge remain inadequate and are \nnot sufficiently effective. Every day that passes until \nan appropriate treatment for the disease is discovered \nincreases the number of victims and causes it to \nspread to new areas. Despite the measures adopted and \nthe efforts made, to date, Africa has not managed to \nsuccessfully deal with the epidemic.\n\nI therefore appeal to the international community \nfrom this rostrum to work efficiently to provide \nnecessary vaccines for people affected by the Ebola \nvirus, to support measures to control its prevention \nand spread, and to increase investments in the field of \nscientific research in virology and endemic diseases, as \nwell as to provide assistance to countries affected by \nthat scourge. In this context, we welcome the actions \nand initiatives taken by some States and international \norganizations on behalf of the countries affected by the \nspread of this disease.\n\nThe phenomenon of illegal immigration and the \ntragedies it engenders daily prompt us to take strong \naction to find efficient and rapid solutions. We cannot \nsimply count the bodies that wash up onto the beaches \nor undertake rescue operations at sea for thousands of \nmigrants crammed in unsafe boats. Illegal immigration \nis a complex phenomenon. It is the cumulative result \nof economic factors and practices linked to organized \ncrime. Consequently, no matter how closely we patrol \nour borders and no matter how rigorous our laws, we \nwill not be able to prevent waves of migrants from \nmoving from south to north. Appropriate solutions \nmust be found that take into account the real causes \nof the phenomenon and that guarantee African youth \nincreased employment opportunities and a dignified \nlife.\n\nGood governance is a necessary precondition for \nsuccessful development efforts. The African political \nelite is fully aware of that fact and is committed \nto promoting collective freedom and consolidating \ndemocracy as the best means for managing public affairs. \nThe African Union has taken preventive measures \nagainst attempts at usurping power by non-democratic \nmeans, including by encouraging democratic practices, \nestablishing pluralism and organizing many transparent \nelections.\n\nIn its very essence, democracy implies the \nparticipation of all sectors of civil society. The nature \nof African societies has therefore required positive \ndiscrimination on behalf of women, allowing them \naccess to elective office and leadership positions in \norder to ensure gener equality. In the same context, \nyouth enjoys priority in development plans and in \nthe political, social and economic policies of African \ncountries. It is estimated that the population of the \ncontinent will reach 3 billion at the threshold of 2050; \ntwo thirds of that total will be youth. That demographic, \nspecific to the continent, calls for a new focus on \ninvestments in infrastructure and social services, and \nfor prioritizing such sectors as housing, employment, \nhuman resources, diversification of energy sources and \nhealth. Focus must also be placed on aligning teaching \nand vocational training with market needs, which will \ncontribute to controlling unemployment and allowing \nyouth to showcase their talents. In fact, unemployment \nin our societies stems less from inadequate employment \nopportunities than from the gap between the numbers \nof those trained and the actual needs of the job market.\n\nWith respect to security, we are currently facing \nmany dangers, including the multiplication of hot spots, \nterrorism, organized crime and trafficking in drugs, \narms and people \u2014 not only in Africa, but throughout \nthe world. All those dangers have a cross-border nature. \nSome African regions have been particularly vulnerable \ndue to the weakness of their democratic practice, the \nspread of ethnic conflicts, economic crises with their \nattendant social tensions, and the precarious situation \n\n\nof their educational systems, which exercerbates youth \nunemployment and deviation.\n\nIn order to address such challenges, the African \nUnion has established efficient mechanisms that rely on \nthe African peace and security architecture, including \nthe Peace and Security Council and the African \nCapacity for Immediate Response to Crises. Despite \nthose efforts and achievements, the fight against \nterrorism remains an international responsibility that \ncalls for close cooperation among all members of the \ninternational community. It is clear that no country \nalone can eradicate the phenomenon of terrorism.\n\nThe fruitful cooperation between the United \nNations Security Council and the African Council for \nPeace and Security has proved effective in resolving \nmany of the armed conflicts on our continent. Despite \nsuch efforts, however, the resolution of the situation \nin Somalia remains complex. Similarly, the situations \nin Libya, northern Nigeria and Central Africa are \ncause for genuine concern. In Libya, unfortunately, \nthe situation continues to deteriorate, foreshadowing \na civil war that could split the country apart, driving \nits people into exile and threatening to spill over into \nneighbouring countries. The international community \nmust intercede to help the Libyans reach a peaceful and \nconsensual solution that guarantees that country\u2019s unity \nand stability. In northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram \nmovement continues to murder innocent people, kidnap \nwomen and destroy entire villages. Africa and the rest \nof the international community must join forces and \ntake decisive action to eliminate that terrorist group, \nwhich threatens the whole region.\n\nIn the Central African Republic, the efforts of \nthe African peacekeeping force, with the support of \nfriendly forces, helped stop the massacres and prevented \nthe conflict from evolving into a full-fledged civil \nwar. However, persistent tension between the factions \nrequires us to encourage Central African stakeholders \nto use this stage of the transition build trust and to \novercome the remaining obstacles to that country\u2019s \npeace and stability.\n\nSuch situations should not lead us to overlook \nthe peacebuilding progress that has been achieved in \nmany conflict regions. In that regard, we commend and \nwelcome the advances registered in the region of the \nGreat Lakes, in northern Mali and in the Republic of \nSouth Sudan.\n\nThe Sahel was one of the first African regions to \nexperience the phenomenon of terrorism. But thanks to \nthe close security cooperation among the countries of the \nregion and to international solidarity, the terrorists were \nrepelled and the activities of illegal trafficking networks \nwere paralysed. In North Mali, too, Africans have \nrobustly addressed a difficult situation. Thus, several \ncountries of the continent, along with international \nfriendly forces, deterred terrorist groups. The risk of \nterrorism was eliminated from key areas from which \ncriminal terrorist operations had been launched. The \nFrench intervention was decisive and timely. Likewise, \nhistory will remember the great sacrifices that continue \nto be made by the brave soldiers of Chad.\n\nHowever, the region is still exposed to security \nrisks, which for the moment are relatively contained. \nThe eradication of terrorism in the Sahel region \nconstitutes a major challenge additional to those \nimpeding development and poverty reduction. There is \na close correlation between development and security, \nbecause it is impossible to conceive of sustainable \ndevelopment without security, or security without \nintegrated development.\n\nIn that regard, the countries of the region are \naware of the need, on the one hand, to create a regional \nframework to coordinate development efforts and, on \nthe other, to combat the dangers of terrorism and cross-\nborder crime. Therefore, the Group of Five countries \nof the Sahel was created at the summit meeting of \nmember States held in Nouakchott in February. The \ninternational community is invited to join Africans \nin their hopes and legitimate aspirations for peace, \nsecurity and sustainable development.\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East, which escalates \nfrom time to time, with no hope of achieving a clear \nand definite solution despite multiple Arab and \ninternational initiatives, constitutes an ongoing danger \nto world peace. The parties in conflict must agree to \nmake sacrifices, even painful ones. The international \ncommunity must also ramp up pressure and act swiftly \nto find a fair solution to the conflict on the basis of \nrelevant international resolutions, including those that \nguarantee the Palestinian people the establishment of \nan independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \ncapital.\n\nFurthermore, the dangerous situations in Syria \nand Iraq that have been created by the expansion \nof terrorism are causes of grave concern for the \ninternational community. We welcome the recent \nmeasures taken to combat terrorist groups in Iraq, and \nwe invite the parties to the Syrian conflict to renounce \n\n\nviolence and engage in negotiations to avoid further \ndestruction to their country. The crisis in Ukraine must \nlikewise be resolved peacefully and quickly in order to \npreserve global peace and to prevent the situation from \ngenerating tensions between the major Powers.\n\nThe African continent seeks to strengthen its \npresence in international forums and institutions, \ncommensurate with its size and role, in order to make \nthem more representative of its peoples and nations. \nAlthough the General Assembly is an international \ninstitution in which all countries are represented \nequally, the status of permanent member of the Security \nCouncil remains the monopoly of a restricted number \nof countries. That privilege, which dates back to the \nSecond World War of the last century, no longer reflects \ninternational geopolitical reality and does not take into \naccount the profound transformations that have taken \nplace throughout the world. Today, Africa occupies an \nimportant position in the world and plays a distinctive \nrole within the international community, making it a \ncandidate for permanent representation on the Security \nCouncil. It is therefore critical to engage as soon as \npossible in negotiations on the rules for expanding both \npermanent and non-permanent representation on the \nSecurity Council.\n\nThe establishment of justice at the international \nlevel also entails reform of the world economic system \nto make it more equitable through greater promotion \nof the role of the United Nations in efforts to increase \ntransparency, improve regulation of the financial system \nand promote the investment necessary to sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nFinally, I offer my sincere thanks for the efforts \nmade to ensure the success of this session. Attaining the \nlofty aims for which the United Nations was established \nremains dependent on the freedom of the world\u2019s people \nto exercise their right to development, advancement \nand progress so that all humankind may live in dignity, \nfreedom, justice and equality.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour \nand privilege to address the General Assembly as the \nKing of Spain at the start of my reign.\n\nI appear before the Assembly to share with the \ninternational community my country\u2019s commitment \nto the universal principles and values that best define \nhumanity. Today I have the pleasure to present what \nSpain \u2014 renewed but remaining true to itself and to \nits international commitments \u2014 can offer for peace, \nliberty, justice and human rights in all nations and for \nall persons, along with well-being and prosperity.\n\nAs a nation with ancient roots and a clear global \ncalling, Spain has contributed intensely and decisively \nto shaping world history. Let us recall that Spain was \npresent at the genesis of globalization and of international \nlaw, as well as of medieval parliamentarianism and \ncontemporary liberal democracy. With that perspective \nof centuries, we see clearly that our best contributions \ncome about when we move forward while opening up \nto the world.\n\nSincerely, despite our problems, I see Spanish \nsociety today as exemplary in its commitment to human \ndignity, in solidarity with the most marginalized. \nSpaniards harbour a profound sense of equality. They \nreject fanaticism, violence and intolerance and love \npeace. Spanish society is culturally and linguistically \ndiverse, capable of overcoming difficulties responsibly \nand with integrity while demanding integrity and \nexcellence as civic values intrinsic to democracy. Spain \nis a strong, generous and vigorous country, and I feel \ntruly proud of it.\n\nTherefore, today we Spaniards look to the future \nwith a firm will to share and to help to build a better \nreality for all peoples. Our foundations are solid, forged \nover centuries and strengthened especially in recent \ndecades. The commitments Spain has made with the \nrest of the international community are established on \nthose foundations.\n\nDemocracy is today the essential guide of our \ncollective coexistence. It will soon be four decades \nsince the beginning of Spain\u2019s political transition, \nwhich allowed us to move from a dictatorship to a \npolitical system based on freedoms and rights and \nmarked by a desire for historical reconciliation and a \ntrue spirit of harmony. Allow me, therefore, to lay claim \nSpain\u2019s political masterpiece with pride and emotion, \nan example for many in the world. We Spaniards have \nbuilt a social and democratic order based on the rule \nof law that protects all citizens and Spain\u2019s various \nterritories in their political, geographic, cultural and \nlinguistic diversity. Thus Spain\u2019s firm commitment \nto promoting and defending democratic values in the \nworld can always be counted on.\n\nWithout forgetting the impact of the crisis, Spain\u2019s \neconomic development, particularly since the second \nhalf of the past century, has placed our economy among \nthe first in the world and among the most open and \ncompetitive. Today we have achieved global leadership \nrankings in various sectors with a high added value \nand significant social impact. Bearing that in mind, \nSpain strongly supports a global and sustainable way \nof economic development that makes possible material \nprogress and well-being, that generates employment \nand protects individuals and their social rights, a \nsustainable development model respectful of the \nenvironment, respecting international norms and with \nhigh, ethical economic values.\n\nSpain has always been a major cultural Power. \nWe understand that in all societies, culture shapes our \nidentity and is a source of material and non-material \nwealth. The strength of Spanish, a universal language \nshared by dozens of countries and hundreds of millions \nof people on all continents, decisively contributes to \nguaranteeing greater cultural and linguistic diversity in \nthe international arena. That is clearly an objective of \nthe human community, so widely diverse, represented \nhere. The Spanish language must therefore fully \nassume its formal position as an official language of \nthe United Nations and as a working language that is \nfully used and represented. Given the scope and depth \nof our cultural base, we affirm Spain\u2019s commitment \nto defending cultural diversity in all of its aspects and \nmanifestations.\n\n\nSpain\u2019s history and privileged geographic position \nat a crossroads of continents, seas and civilizations \nhave led it to develop a solid, universal perspective \nand a special connection to some regions in the world. \nAmong them, Europe represents an obvious dimension. \nThe process of continental integration around the \nEuropean Union today is part of the national project of \nthe Kingdom of Spain. We call for a Europe of greater \nunity and cohesiveness that preserves and extends the \ndemocratic and civic values that inspired its creation \nand that works to guarantee the prosperity of all of its \ncitizens. We also defend a Europe that is marked by \nstrength and solidarity that generously and effectively \ncontributes to the peaceful progress of all regions of \nthe world.\n\nDue to its history and culture, the Ibero-American \ncommunity of nations is a substantial part of our \ncollective identity and represents for us a true \nbrotherhood. That sentiment extends to other areas, \nthanks to the cultural, historic and linguistic \nconnections that we also maintain with other nations \nand peoples in the rest of the Americas, in Africa, Asia \nand Oceania.\n\nThe Mediterranean, with its northern and southern \nshores, together with the Middle East and the entire \nArab world, are areas very close to Spain, not only \ngeographically, but also culturally and emotionally. \nThat is why we affirm our will and interest in \ncontributing to the stability of the region, as something \nfundamental for achieving peace in the world. It is a \nregion in which some societies suffer the scourge of an \nintolerable barbarism, a criminal and atrocious violence \nthat threatens all societies of the planet and the very \nvalues of universal human civilization.\n\nSpain\u2019s global vocation and its commitments in \ndemocratic, economic and cultural matters that I have \njust mentioned are summarized by its full commitment \nto the Charter of the United Nations, on behalf of which \nwe are convened here. The Charter represents one of \nthe greatest achievements of humankind; we must \ntherefore preserve, respect and enforce it. Thus Spain \nfirmly believes in the United Nations and its multilateral \nmechanisms for preserving international peace and \nsecurity and for contributing to the development of \nsocieties.\n\nWe live in times marked by a proliferation of \nconflicts, some of which are especially devastating and \nhave indiscriminate impacts on civilians. Our primary \nobjective must be to prevent war, and when we fail, we \nmust protect and assist the innocent and the injured. \nWe must never relent in our efforts to resolve conflict \nthrough diplomacy and all of the instruments bestowed \nby the Charter of the United Nations. Above all, we \nmust not lose hope, and we must remember that in spite \nof everything, the longing for harmony can and must \nprevail over even the most entrenched hatreds.\n\nA tapestry version of Guernica \u2014 a work by the \nuniversal Spaniard, Pablo Picasso \u2014 hangs outside the \nentrance to the Security Council Chamber. The scene \ndepicted in this art icon still stirs our conscience and \nreminds us of the fatal consequences of our inability to \nprevent and resolve conflicts that afflict us all. It is a \nmistake to think that wars or man-made disasters affect \nonly one community or one region without any impact \non the others. When barbarism triumphs in one part of \nthe world, no one is beyond its reach; we are all victims.\n\nBut armed conflicts are not the only threats to the \ninternational community. Evil takes many forms and \ntheir victims have many faces: every child caught in \na crisis situation or in violence, every woman who is \nmolested or whose rights are limited simply because \nshe is a woman, every patient who dies for lack of \nmedicine or every abandoned elderly person, every \nfamily without food and without hope because of an \nunjust distribution of wealth, every journalist murdered \nfor doing his or her duty to inform \u2014 all of these are \nso many appeals to our conscience and to our sense of \nduty, and so many calls to action.\n\nThe members of the General Assembly can count \non Spain as we confront, together and in the framework \nof international law, those who seek to destroy, through \ntheir intolerance, violence or sectarianism, the values \nand principles that underlie our United Nations. Spain \nhas always demonstrated its unconditional support for \nthe United Nations system and its active responsibility \nwith regard to the principles that we all recognize in \nthis Assembly: freedom, justice, equality, national \nsovereignty, independence and the integrity of States. \nSpain will continue to assume, as it has, its full \nresponsibilities as a Member of United Nations.\n\nAgainst this background, Spain is taking another \nstep forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat \non the Security Council for the 2015-2016 biennium. \nOur candidacy is an integral part of my country\u2019s solid \ncommitment to serve the international community \nmore, and to serve it better. That is what we have done \n\n\nin the Security Council once every decade over the past \n40 years, because the Assembly has trusted us. I only \nask that that trust be renewed.\n\nIn the past 25 years, 130,000 members of the \nSpanish armed forces have participated in peacekeeping \noperations and humanitarian aid missions in all regions \nof the world. They have been \u2014 and, above all, have \nfelt \u2014 part of a great collective effort to which many \nof the countries represented here have contributed. \nSimilarly, in recent decades Spain has consolidated its \nstatus as one of the leading contributors to development \ncooperation. There is no lasting peace without lasting \nsecurity, without sustainable development. There is \nno sustainable development without greater solidarity, \nboth among and within nations. Furthermore, \ndevelopment must be accompanied by policies of \ninclusion that envisage the full equality of women and \ntheir incorporation in all spheres of political, social and \neconomic life.\n\nAs we can see, Spain has a spirit of solidarity. In \nthe past 14 years, my compatriots have contributed \n$30 billion to global development. Of this contribution, \nnearly $1 billion has been earmarked for achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, through a fund set up \nby Spain and co-led by the United Nations Development \nProgramme. That is the largest contribution made by a \nsingle country. Specifically, one of the most important \ntasks of the General Assembly at this session will be to \nfinalize the negotiations for the post-2015 development \nagenda and to establish the sustainable development \ngoals. Here, too, Spain has taken a step forward by \ncreating the first fund that is already functioning for \nthese sustainable development goals.\n\nTo a large extent, achieving sustainability involves \nfighting the harmful effects of climate change. The \nClimate Summit held yesterday and the recent Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, held in Samoa \u2014 whose organization Spain \ncontributed to \u2014 have raised our awareness even \nfurther on this issue. They also enable us to improve \nour response and resilience in the face of restricted \nsituations, especially as regards the most vulnerable \nStates whose very survival is at risk.\n\nThe sustainable development goals that we have \nset for ourselves are within our reach. Again, there \nare reasons for hope. I am thinking in particular of the \nprogress made in Africa, a continent that is so close \nto Spain and where new examples of innovation and \ncreativity are found everywhere. Africa is a continent \nof the present and future, where over the past decade we \nhave seen some of the fastest-growing economies. But \nit is crucial to put an end to the conflicts that still afflict \nparts of the region and hold back its development. From \nthe Sahel to the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes \nregion, Spain contributes to ending these conflicts \nby meeting its commitments, which are born out of \nsolidarity and proximity.\n\nWe believe in Africa and we are demonstrating that \nbelief, for instance when acute crises arise such as the \nEbola epidemic, which is affecting a major and growing \npart of the central region. I want to express the Spanish \npeople\u2019s solidarity with the victims and our support for \nthose who are doing everything possible to assist them, \nsometimes at the cost of their own lives. And I offer my \nown heartfelt tribute to the humanitarian aid workers of \nthe United Nations, whose vocation leads them to leave \neverything behind for the most vulnerable, wherever \nthey may be.\n\nIt has been almost 30 years since my father, \nKing Juan Carlos, addressed this General Assembly for \nthe first time (see A/41/PV.4). Today, as then, Spain is \nopen to a new age. Today, as then, we take our place \nas active and responsible members of international \ncommunity represented here. I can assure those present \nhere that the international community, represented \ntoday in the General Assembly, can continue to count \non Spain\u2019s support and active participation in the \nunwavering protection of the values and interests of \nhumankind in peace, peace that is ever more prosperous \nand just. Spain supports a United Nations that is not \nonly stronger but, above all, more united \u2014 more \nunited against bigotry, intolerance and barbarism, more \nunited in fighting poverty, hunger and marginalization, \nmore united so that education and health can reach all, \nand more united in firmly defending the dignity of all \nhuman beings.\n"

        "file_text": "His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Sovereign of the \nKingdom of Morocco, asked me to convey to the \nAssembly his greetings. He also asked me to deliver \nthe following statement, prepared for the sixty-ninth \nsession of the General Assembly:\n\n\u201cIt gives me great pleasure to take part in the \nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, for \nwhich President Kutesa has suggested \u2018Delivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u2019 as the central theme. That \nis a very relevant choice, which is fully in line \nwith our Organization\u2019s priorities, especially as \nit encompasses economic, social, environmental, \nsecurity and political considerations. I have \ntherefore decided to devote my address to that \nimportant topic, knowing that the Kingdom of \nMorocco\u2019s standpoint regarding other items on \nthe session\u2019s agenda will be presented during the \nGeneral Assembly committee meetings or at the \nministerial meetings, which will be held on the \nsidelines of the General Assembly.\n\u201cAchieving sustainable development is one of \nthe pressing challenges facing humankind. It is \nparticularly important, in that respect, to strike a \nbalance between the requirements for economic \nand social progress and the protection of the \nenvironment, on the one hand, and the safeguard \nof the rights of future generations, on the other. \nAware of those critical challenges, we have sought \nto set up a distinctive development model rooted \nin the culture and in the specific national values of \nthe Moroccan people \u2014 a model which also takes \ninto account the need for positive interaction with \ninternational principles and objectives in that area.\n\u201cMorocco has therefore managed to develop \na pioneering national initiative for human \ndevelopment, together with ambitious programmes \nin the field of renewable energy \u2014 especially solar \nand wind power generation \u2014 which are a key \ncomponent of sustainable development. However, \nI am not here today to discuss my country\u2019s \nexperience or our achievements. I am here to make \nan appeal for developing countries to be treated \nfairly, especially in Africa, and for the development \nissue to be addressed objectively.\n\u201cAs the Assembly knows, sustainable \ndevelopment is not something that can be achieved \nthrough decisions and ready-made prescriptions, \nnor is there a single model in that area. Indeed, \nevery country follows a path of its own, taking into \nconsideration its historical development, cultural \nheritage, human and natural resources, specific \npolitical circumstances, as well as its economic \nchoices and the obstacles and challenges facing \nit. What applies to the West should not be used as \nthe sole criterion for determining the efficiency of \nother development models; nor should one make \ncomparisons between countries, however similar \ntheir circumstances may be, even when those \ncountries belong to the same geographical area.\n\u201cAs a result, the first call I should like to \nmake from the rostrum regards the need to respect \nthe characteristic values and principles of every \ncountry as it builds its own development model. \nThat is particularly true for the developing countries \nthat are still suffering from the consequences of \ncolonialism. Colonialism caused severe damage to \ncolonized countries. For many years, it hindered \ntheir development process, exploited their resources, \nas well as the energies of their sons and daughters, \nbrought about profound change in the customs \nand cultures of the peoples concerned and sowed \nthe seeds not only of division between members \nof the same community, but also of conflict and \ndiscord between neighbouring countries. Although \nmany years have passed, the colonizers bear a \n\nhistorical responsibility for the tough \u2014 and at \ntimes tragic \u2014 circumstances experienced by \nsome countries of the South, particularly in Africa. \nToday, given the adverse consequences suffered, \nformer colonial Powers have no right to ask the \ncountries of the South to introduce radical change \nrapidly, on the basis of a frame of reference with \nwhich they are unfamiliar, be it in terms of their \ncultures, their principles or their values. It is as if \nno development were possible other than through a \nsingle model: that of the West.\n\u201cI now turn to the second appeal I would \nlike to make to the international community. We \nneed more realism and wisdom when dealing \nwith those countries. There should also be greater \nconsideration for their circumstances and the \npaths they choose to achieve democracy and \ndevelopment. Some Western countries \u2014 which \nasked for no one\u2019s authorization to colonize \ncountries of the South \u2014 instead of currently \nproviding the necessary assistance to the people of \nthose countries, continue to impose on them harsh \nconditions, thereby hampering their ability to make \nprogress. Furthermore, all Western countries and \ntheir affiliated institutions do is give lessons, and, \nat best, a few pieces of advice. As for support, it \nis very limited and is always conditional. What is \nmore, they ask the countries of the South to achieve \nstability and development within a very short time \nframe and according to imposed conditions, without \ntaking into account those countries\u2019 development \nprocesses or their specific national circumstances.\n\u201cThere can be no stability without \ndevelopment. By the same token, development \ncannot be achieved without stability. Both hinge \non respect for the sovereignty of States, their \nterritorial integrity, culture and customs, as well as \non a dignified life for all their citizens. Moreover, \nthe rating and classification of those countries, \naccording to current standards, raises a number of \nquestions. The rating process has not only shown \nits limitations, but also how far removed it is from \nthe reality of the countries of the South and how \nincapable it is of giving an objective account of \nthe level of human development achieved by those \ncountries. As inadequate as it unfortunately is, the \naid granted is often based on those ratings and their \nquasi-impossible conditions. We therefore appeal \nfor intangible capital to be one of the primary criteria \nfor measuring wealth and rating nations. As clearly \nshown by World Bank studies, intangible capital \ntakes into consideration a series of factors related \nto the living conditions of the population, such as \nsecurity, stability, human resources, institutional \ndevelopment and the quality of life and of the \nenvironment, all of which are elements that have \na major impact on crafting public policies. The \nevolution of those countries should not be governed \nby any rating or classification; instead, it should be \nviewed as a historical process based on the positive \nexperiences of each country. Similarly, every \ncountry\u2019s characteristics should be respected.\n\u201cThe reference to the negative impact of \ncolonialism does not mean we wish to put any party \nin the dock of a law court. It is simply an earnest \nappeal for justice for the countries of the South and \na reconsideration of the way they are dealt with and \nsupported in their gradual march towards progress. \nIn my address in Abidjan, in February, I insisted on \nthe fact that Africa did not need humanitarian aid as \nmuch as it needed mutually beneficial partnerships. \nI also stressed that Africa needed to turn the page \non its past and overcome its political, economic \nand social problems \u2014 that it needed to rely on its \nown resources to achieve its development. That is \nexactly what Morocco has sought to accomplish \nthrough a series of important agreements signed \nwith a number of African sister nations. In that \nrespect, I wish to mention in particular the strategic \nagreement signed with Gabon for the production \nof fertilizers for African markets in order to \ncontribute to development and food security on the \nAfrican continent, which is home to a staggering \n60 per cent of the world\u2019s unexploited land. That is \nan outstanding model of South-South cooperation \nthat reflects our capacity as African countries to \ndevelop the continent by relying on ourselves and \ninvesting in the natural resources of our countries.\n\u201cAs the Assembly knows, achieving \ndevelopment does not hinge merely on a set of \nprojects and on funding; nor is underdevelopment \nsynonymous with the countries of the South. Indeed, \nthe problem has nothing to do with Africans\u2019 \nattributes and skills. Africans have proved their \nability to produce and create whenever the right \nconditions are met, and whenever they are able to rid \nthemselves of the oppressive legacy of colonialism. \nSimilarly, development in Africa has little to do \nwith the nature of the land or the weather, as harsh \nas they may be in some parts of the continent. It \n\nis more closely related to a deep-rooted economic \ndependence, a lack of support and funding and \nthe absence of a sustainable development model. \nAs a result, providing aid to those countries is not \nan option or an act of generosity so much as it is \na necessity and a duty. What States really need, \nthough, is fruitful cooperation, grounded in mutual \nrespect, so that they can create the right conditions, \nin theory and in practice, to move on to the next \nstage of the process of promoting both democracy \nand development, without any interference by \nothers in their internal affairs. In return, they must \ncommit to good governance.\n\u201cThe world stands at a crossroads today. Either \nthe international community supports developing \ncountries in their quest to achieve progress and \nensure security and stability, or we shall all face \nthe consequences of more conflicts and greater \nfanaticism, violence and terrorism \u2014 all of which \nfeed on feelings of injustice and exclusion \u2014 and no \npart of the world will be safe. As people grow more \nacutely aware of the cross-border threats posed by \nthe lack of sustainable and human development, \nand as we realize that ours is ultimately a common \ndestiny, I am sure that eventually there will be a \nglobal awakening regarding the need to work for a \nmore secure, equitable and humane world.\u201d"

        "file_text": "It is both \nan honour and a pleasure for me to once again address \nthe Assembly.\n\n(spoke in English)\nFor more than 70 years, Canada has supported the \nUnited Nations and its institutions in the pursuit of \nworld peace. On many occasions Canadians have put \ntheir lives on the line to deter active conflict between \npeoples. It is a duty we accept and it is a record of which \nwe are proud.\n\nToday, there are many embattled parts of the world \nwhere the suffering of the local populations and the \nthreats to global security deserve our urgent attention, \nand I could easily use my entire time here on any one \nof them. There are, however, other areas of service to \nhumankind. It is to some of those that I wish to speak \ntonight, for there is more to peace than the absence of \nwar. Where human misery abounds, where grinding \npoverty is the rule, where justice is systematically \ndenied, there is no real peace \u2014 only the seeds of \nfuture conflict. \n\n(spoke in French)\nOf course, misery and injustice are not the only \nroots of war. We need only look at the world today to \nappreciate that.\n\n(spoke in English)\nThen we understand how the worst of human \nnature \u2014 perverse ideologies, religious extremism and \nthe lust for power and plunder \u2014 can rob people in so \nmany places of property, hope and life itself. That is \nwhy Canada has always been ready and willing to join \nwith other civilized peoples and to challenge affronts to \nthe international order, affronts to human dignity itself, \nsuch as those that are today present in Eastern Europe, \nparticularly Ukraine, in the Middle East \u2014 Iraq, Syria \nand elsewhere \u2014 and of course many parts of Africa.\n\nCanada\u2019s positions on those issues are well known, \nand we will continue to contribute to the extent to \nwhich we are able in assisting our friends and allies \nin the international community to deal with those \ngrave challenges. But while those extreme situations \nare being confronted, other problems \u2014 pandemics, \nclimate change and, of course, the problems of \nunderdevelopment \u2014 remain. \n\n(spoke in French)\nAnd we feel strongly that no effort is ever in vain \nif it offers peoples an alternative to conflict and the \npossibility of a better life for them and their families.\n\n(spoke in English)\nCanadians therefore seek a world where freedom, \ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law are \nrespected. We hold those things to be intrinsically right \nand good. We also believe that they are the necessary \nfoundation for a better world for more people and are \nnecessary for prosperity. With prosperity comes hope, \nand with hope, the greater inclination of free peoples \neverywhere to find peaceful solutions to the things \nthat divide them. Indeed, we believe that freedom, \nprosperity and peace form a virtuous circle. \n\nFor that reason, the growth of trade among nations \nand the delivery of effective development assistance to \nordinary people \u2014 simple, practical aid \u2014 are the things \nthat have become the signatures of our Government\u2019s \noutreach in the world. Trade means jobs, growth and \nopportunities. It has made great nations out of small \nones. The story of my own country, Canada, is a case in \npoint. Historically, trade has built our country, just as \ntoday it is reshaping our world. Trade means ordinary \npeople can support their families and even dare to \ndream of something much more.\n\n\n\f\n(spoke in French)\nOur Government has worked hard to establish a \nvast network of modern trade agreements.\n\n(spoke in English)\nThe trade agreements we have concluded tear down \nthe barriers of tariff and excise and enlarge markets and \nopportunities for buyers and sellers alike. Canada has \nnow established such links with countries that today \npossess more than a quarter of the world\u2019s people and \nnearly half the world\u2019s business. And our free-trade \nnetwork will grow larger yet. It is not, by the way, an \nexclusive club for wealthy nations.\n\n(spoke in French)\nCanada has already liberalized its trade with \ncountries better known for their determination to \nsucceed than for the size of their economies, thereby \nopening the way for them to access Canadian and other \nmarkets. We have no reason to stop now. As indicated \nby my colleague from Senegal, President Macky Sall, \n\u201cAid is needed for development, but what is needed \neven more is investment\u201d. He is quite right.\n\n(spoke in English)\nYet no matter how freely we trade, millions of \npeople will need a helping hand for some time to come. \nEasily the most important example, and the one closest \nto my heart, is the worldwide struggle upon which \nso many of you have been engaged, in the maternal, \nnewborn and child health initiative. Saving the lives \nof the world\u2019s most vulnerable mothers, infants and \nchildren must remain a top global priority. That is, the \nworld must honour the commitments made in this very \nHall to mothers and children in the year 2000. And \nthere has been remarkable progress.\n\n(spoke in French)\nThanks to inexpensive vaccines and the combined \nefforts of multiple partners, more children are \nbeing vaccinated today than ever before. And as the \nimportance of nutrition becomes better understood, \nmore and more children are surviving. Thanks to \nsimple, low-cost, easily accessible techniques, literally \nmillions of mothers and children who a mere 14 years \nago might have died not only survive today, but thrive.\n\n(spoke in English)\nI think especially of the 2010 meeting of world \nleaders at Muskoka, which raised about $7.5 billion \ndollars, $2 billion of it from private donors. Based on \nthat, the United Nations launched what the Secretary-\nGeneral called the \u201cEvery woman, every child\u201d initiative, \nwith the goal of saving 16 million lives by 2016. An \nimportant aspect of that work has been monitoring \nboth the receipt of monies pledged and how they are \nused. The assurance of full accountability has allowed \nrecipients to plan with greater certainty and donors to \ngive with confidence. With His Excellency President \nKikwete of Tanzania, whom we have just heard, it was \nmy honour to co-chair the World Health Organization\u2019s \nInformation and Accountability Commission linked to \nthat initiative.\n\nOn this, we have a clear vision, and that vision is \nachievable. We know how to help a great many of those \nvulnerable people. We have seen what can be done. We \nwant simply to rally the passion and the will to make it \nhappen. We are preventing deaths, and we can prevent \nmore \u2014 deaths of thousands of children every day from \neasily preventable causes. We can stop the thousands \nof mothers dying in childbirth who would survive \nwith relatively little intervention. We also know who \nwe need to be working with \u2014 new partnerships that \nbring together Governments and agencies of the United \nNations, including the World Health Organization, the \nWorld Food Programme and UNICEF, with the private \nsector, partnerships that are producing real results and \ntaking us to new heights of excellence.\n\nHere I am thinking of the Maternal, Newborn \nand Child Health Network in Canada, a group that \nrepresents a broad base of Canadian civil society and \nis a key implementing partner on the ground. As many \nrepresentatives know, in May in Toronto, Canada hosted \nthe world\u2019s leading actors on that subject. We heard \nthe success stories \u2014 for example, the Micronutrient \nInitiative through which 180 million children received \nvitamin A, pills that cost pennies but drop child \nmortality by 25 per cent. We heard about the Global \nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization and how \nduring the three-year period between \n2010 and 2013, \nimmunizations saved the lives of 2 million children.\n\nWe have partnerships to deliver better nutrition and \npartnerships to deliver better measurement, because \nvital statistics are critical. One cannot manage what \none cannot measure. And in that mission, we measure \nprogress in precious lives saved. So every child needs \na birth certificate.\n\n\n\f\n(spoke in French)\nWe also heard that in the world today is a greater \nobligation with regard to accountability, not only with \nregard to the vast sums of money pledged, but also the \nway in which that money is spent.\n\n(spoke in English)\nSo our consensus was clear. We have seen success, \nand we have momentum. Saving the lives of children \nand mothers is a fight we can win. To get it done, two \nthings are needed now: political focus and renewed \nfinancial commitment. I therefore urge the Assembly, in \nthe strongest terms, to ensure that, maternal, newborn \nand child health remains a clear and top priority in the \nevolving post-2015 development agenda \u2014 and one \nof a limited number of priorities. That is the political \nfocus we need. Then there is the financial commitment. \nI know we all have many competing priorities. But we \nhave come so far that to stop now would be a tragedy.\n\nI must say I was very encouraged this afternoon \nat the Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cEvery woman, every child\u201d \nevent, when President Kim of the World Bank and other \nleaders announced new financing for the Bank\u2019s Global \nFinancing Facility for Every Woman Every Child. \nThat Facility will help developing countries access the \nfinancing required to improve their health systems. I \nwas pleased to announce that Canada would financially \nsupport the World Bank\u2019s Global Financing Facility for \nEvery Woman Every Child. \n\n(spoke in French)\nWe urge other countries to do likewise because \nto provide viable solutions to prevent the tragic death \nof women and children, we need to increase budget \nallocations on the part of both donors and the developing \ncountries.\n\n(spoke in English)\nIn closing, let me just say this. There are many \nindividual countries and many specific causes that will \nrightly occupy our deliberations here this week. Let us \nalso not forget to look beyond those crises at the long-\nterm opportunities and efforts that can truly transform \nthe world. We have it in our power to create a better \nkind of world for our children\u2019s children than the one \nwe have today.\n\nAnd we should, for it was never the intention of the \nfounders of the United Nations \u2014 Canada being one \nof them \u2014 that ours would be a world where terrorists \ncould get the resources necessary to sow death and \ndestruction but where workers and families could \nnot get jobs and opportunities, or where mothers and \nchildren could not obtain the necessities required to \nlive and thrive.\n\nThe world that Canada strives for is the world that \nthe founders of the United Nations wanted from the \nbeginning, as boldly articulated in their Declaration \nof 1 January 1942 \u2014 a world where \u201clife, liberty, \nindependence and religious freedom\u201d are defended, \nwhere \u201chuman rights and justice\u201d are preserved, and \nwhere all join \u201cin a common struggle against savage and \nbrutal forces seeking to subjugate the world\u201d. In such \na world, there can be prosperity for the impoverished, \njustice for the weak and, for the desperate, that most \nprecious of all things, hope.\n\nIt is easy to look at the many problems of the world \ntoday and become despondent. Yet for all our failings, \nthere has been, for most of humankind, tremendous \nprogress in my lifetime. Therefore, I am enough of an \noptimist to think that because we can create a more \nprosperous, fairer and hopeful world, not only should \nwe, but indeed, I believe we will find the will to do so.\n"

        "file_text": "When the United Nations was \nfounded nearly 70 years ago, it was created to fulfil the \naspiration that peace and diplomacy could overcome \nself-interest and to ensure that, through effective \ncooperation, the world could avoid grave security \nthreats. But the decades since the signing of the Charter \nof the United Nations have been marked by nearly as \nmany failures as successes, and many of those failures \ncould have been prevented by early action and stronger \npolitical will.\n\nI am particularly concerned today about the recent \nevents in Ukraine and the rapid spread of violent \nterrorism in Syria and Iraq, even though the Pacific \nIslands sit halfway around the world, a fragile region \n\n\nfar away from the global super-Powers. The leaders of \nnations have in our hands the means either to respond \nwith alert action or to turn our backs on a growing \ndanger.\n\nClimate change poses no less of a security threat \nto our Pacific shores, and, indeed, to the world. As a \nlow-lying country, the Marshall Islands has no higher \nground \u2014 nowhere to go \u2014 and we will not cede an \ninch to rising waters. Earlier this week, over 120 world \nleaders met in this Hall to signal our political will \nand our commitment. No one should take that lightly. \nLeaders simply cannot afford to play consensus games \nor to squabble.\n\nYet words and intentions alone do not meet the full \nchallenge before us. There will be serious emissions \ngaps between what the world will do and what needs \nto be done to save my nation. Earlier this week, young \npoet and mother Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall \nIslands stepped onto this very same stage to urge world \nleaders to take action. Today, on behalf of the most \nvulnerable nations \u2014 those at the front line \u2014 I ask of \nthe leaders of the largest nations, the major emitters, in \nKathy\u2019s very same words, to\n\n\u201ctake us all along on your ride. We will not slow \nyou down. We will help you win the most important \nrace of all, the race to save humanity\u201d.\nLike no other global challenge, climate change \nrequires direct political ownership and eye-to-eye \nengagement with leaders. This issue, more than any \nother, will define the Secretary-General\u2019s legacy as \nleader of these united nations. I urge him not only to \ncontinue to show his commendable personal leadership, \nbut also to use his good offices to help find creative \npolitical solutions.\n\nEveryone \u2014 large and small, rich and poor \u2014 must \nand will take strong action on emissions. In that regard, \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly supports \nthe Federated States of Micronesia, the United States \nof America, and many other nations in urging a rapid \nglobal phase-down of hydrofluorocarbon gases under \nthe Montreal Protocol. I will personally attend the Paris \nclimate conference next December, so that my voice \nand that of my people can be heard.\n\nUnlike many other fights, the huge global fight to \naddress climate change is also a personal one for me. \nIt starts in my own backyard, with my own seawall, \nbuilt with my own hands, to push back rising waters, \nsave my own future and the future of my children \nand grandchildren. But that is not enough. We face a \nchallenge that is nearly beyond belief. As with so many \nother moments in the history of the United Nations, we \nhave to ask whether leaders will respond to the climate \nthreat with courage. Or will some nations, including \nsome close friends of the Pacific Islands, slide back in \ntheir efforts, bury their heads in the sand and ignore an \nobvious climate reality? I hope and expect that at the \ncoming Group of Twenty meeting later this year, the \nworld\u2019s largest economies will address climate change \nand the economic consequences of inaction. The Pacific \nisland countries demand no less.\n\n\nLast month, nations around the world gathered in \nApia for the third international conference on small \nisland developing States. As hosts of the conference, \nthe Government and people of Samoa showed the world \ntrue Pacific hospitality. As we have for decades, Pacific \nleaders have spoken firmly \u2014 in last year\u2019s Majuro \nDeclaration for Climate Leadership, in this year\u2019s Palau \nDeclaration on \u201cThe Ocean: Life and Future\u201d, and again \nin the Small Island Developing States Accelerated \nModalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway).\n\nOur development needs are beyond urgent and \nmust not to be put off for yet another year. While \nthe SAMOA Pathway charts a course forward for \ninternational partnership with small islands, there is \ntoo often a mismatch between our national structures \nand complicated sources of assistance. It is my hope \nand expectation that the major announcements and \npartnerships from the Samoa Summit will not lose \nmomentum because of poor connections in the \ndelivery channels. Our needs are often modest, but \nthe trickle-down of international assistance and \nglobal development somehow fails to reach our local \ncommunities and to meet our unique challenges.\n\nIn the follow-up to the Samoa meeting, starting \nthis year I urge the Secretary-General, the international \nsystem and United Nations agencies to start thinking \nseriously about how to work more effectively with \nour unique challenges as island nations. As Member \nStates design a post-2015 development agenda, it is \nimportant that we focus on a strong outcome that has \nthe flexibility to accommodate the unique character \nof each nation. We cannot measure progress without \nspecific benchmarks, but as a small nation we fear that \n\n\nhaving so many ambitions can be equivalent to having \nnone at all. The answer is not to be isolated within a \nseparate, unconnected island strategy, but rather to \nbuild the flexibility needed for so many nations to act \nas one.\n\nI stand firm with my fellow Pacific leaders and \nnations around the world who have urged that there \nbe a United Nations sustainable development goal on \noceans. I am puzzled as to why some nations close their \neyes to two thirds of the world\u2019s surface, pretending \nthat the world\u2019s vast blue waters somehow do not exist. \nThe Pacific Ocean and its rich fisheries are our lifeline. \nWe are the custodians of our own vast resources on \nbehalf of future generations.\n\nWe could introduce a step change in the world\u2019s \nsustainable fisheries and play our own role to address \nglobal food security. Distant-water fishing nations must \nengage us as true development partners and work with \nus to change the focus beyond their immediate national \nindustry and towards a global responsibility. Recent \nprogress on sustainable fisheries has become the \ndefining story of the Pacific \u2014 it is our empowerment \nand our future. The oceans are an equally valuable \nresource for alternate sustainable energy, including \nocean thermal energy conversion.\n\nEveryone should participate on the international \nstage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports \nTaiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in United Nations \nspecialized agencies and mechanisms, including \nthe World Health Organization, the International \nCivil Aviation Organization and the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, as well \nas in key regional economic integration mechanisms. \nFurthermore, I call for Taiwan\u2019s involvement in the \npost-2015 development agenda and urge recognition \nof the important assistance provided to my country \nin health, education and energy. The Marshall Islands \nwelcomes Taiwan\u2019s efforts to reduce cross-Strait \ntensions and urges States Members of the United \nNations to recognize and encourage such progress.\n\nAs a former United Nations Trust Territory, the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands has a unique legacy, \nshared by only a very few in this Hall. It was the United \nNations that helped set us on a path to independence, but \nit was also the United Nations that explicitly authorized \nthe 67 nuclear tests conducted in our nation between \n1946 and 1958. Our own history bears the burden and \nthe contemporary impacts of those tests. Our suffering \ncould have been prevented by the United Nations \u2014 if \nonly its Members had listened. Like many other nations, \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands believes that \nawareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear \nweapons must underpin all approaches and efforts \ntowards nuclear disarmament.\n\nThose facts speak for themselves and were \nrecognized two years ago by the United Nations Special \nRapporteur. We look forward to addressing those issues \nfurther during our participation in the Human Rights \nCouncil universal periodic review next year. For the \nsurvival of humanity it is essential that nuclear weapons \nare never used again, under any circumstances. The \nuniversal way to accomplish that is through the total \nelimination of such weapons. It should be our collective \ngoal as the United Nations to not only stop the spread \nof nuclear weapons, but also to pursue the peace and \nsecurity of a world without them.\n\nThis year, I look forward to a United Nations that \nbetter recognizes the true global challenges of today \nand moves beyond old political cobwebs into our \ndynamic century.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate you, \nMr. President, and your country, Uganda, on assuming, \non behalf of the continent of Africa, the responsibilities \nof President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. The theme that you have chosen for this general \ndebate and the sixty-ninth session, namely, \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d, is timely and most appropriate.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ngalvanized and mobilized the international community \nand the United Nations in a manner never seen before. \nWe have good stories to tell about the journey of the \npast 15 years of implementing the MDGS. In Africa, \nwe seized the opportunity and adopted the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), our \nsociodevelopment blueprint. The African Union\u2019s \nVision 2063 will, together with NEPAD and other \nsocioeconomic development programmes, be the \ncornerstone and foundation of Africa\u2019s development \nagenda going forward. South Africa has also made \nsignificant progress in achieving the MDGs. Reducing \nby half the number of people earning less than a dollar \na day has been achieved, while the proportion of those \nexperiencing hunger has also been halved. South \nAfrica has attained Goal 2, namely, to provide access \nto primary education for all.\n\nBy official international indicators, South Africa is \nalso doing well on MDG 3 to promote and empower \nwomen. South Africa has recorded impressive progress \nthrough the expansion of its health infrastructure \nand improved access to health services for all South \nAfricans.\n\nOn the reduction of child mortality, MDG 4, and the \nimprovement of maternal health, MDG 5, significant \nprogress has also been recorded, but more work remains \nto be done. In fact. more work remains worldwide to \nfully achieve those goals, especially in the developing \nworld. We have to confront the underlying root causes \nthat continue to make it impossible for our people to \nhave a better life.\n\nIn spite of the progress that we have made thus far, \nreports continue to show that Africa is lagging behind \nin the attainment of some of the MDGs. It is for that \nreason that we appreciate the crafting of a post-2015 \nglobal development agenda that will carry forward the \nunfinished business of the MDGs. The post-2015 global \n\ndevelopment agenda will provide a frame of reference \nfor our collective agreement on what has to be done. \nWe reiterate that developed countries should be reliable \npartners and meet their commitments to development \ngoals, such as contributing 0.7 per cent of their \ngross national income towards official development \nassistance. We say that because it does not matter \nwhat the great Organization has achieved in the past \nsix decades if we do not deal comprehensively with the \nscourge of poverty, unemployment and diseases. The \npoor of the world will then consider everything done \nto have been a failure. Indeed, we would have failed in \nour duty if we succeed in preventing another world war \nbut continue to have children dying of malnutrition and \ntreatable diseases.\n\nThe recent outbreak of Ebola in some West \nAfrican States and the number of lives that have \nbeen unnecessarily lost provide a clear example of \nthe challenges that developing countries continue to \ncontend with. We believe that Ebola would have been \ncontained within a few days had the outbreak been in \nthe developed world. But now it has become a pandemic \nthat threatens the economies of affected African States.\n\nThe outbreak has thus exposed the challenges \nresulting from lack of capacity, lack of infrastructure \nand other limited resources in Africa. We are pleased \nthat the United Nations, under the leadership of the \nSecretary-General, is deploying a mission to coordinate \nefforts to combat the virus. South Africa stands ready to \ncontinue to provide whatever resources we have at our \ndisposal to assist the people and Governments of our \nsister countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. \nWe add our voice in calling for more resources to be \ndeployed so as to ensure that the virus is contained.\n\nThe role of the United Nations in supporting the \nstruggles of self-determination and freedom has been \nremarkable. South Africa is a shining example. Twenty \nyears ago, President Nelson Mandela thanked all \nnations for support from this very podium when South \nAfrica was readmitted to the United Nations as a free \nand democratic State. We are reminded of that fact on \nthis important day, which is National Heritage Day in \nmy country.\n\nSince 1994, South Africa has made significant \nprogress in transforming the apartheid State into a \ndemocratic one, founded on the values of human dignity, \nnon-discrimination, non-racialism and non-sexism, the \nrule of law and universal adult suffrage, as enshrined in \nthe Constitution. Given our history and heritage, we are \nmindful of our historic and moral responsibility in the \nglobal struggle against racism, racial discrimination \nand other intolerances. We will, in this regard, continue \nto be at the forefront of efforts to eliminate all forms of \nracism, racial discrimination and any other intolerance, \nincluding xenophobia and anti-Semitism.\n\nThe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \nremain the primary framework adopted by a United \nNations conference in the fight against racism. We \nwill continue to support the struggles for freedom \nand self-determination, including the struggles of the \npeoples of Palestine and Western Sahara, who continue \nto experience occupation and colonialism of different \nforms. The people of Cuba also hold a special place \nin our hearts because of that country\u2019s sacrifice for \nAfrican freedom. We will therefore continue to support \ntheir struggle for economic liberation.\n\nWhile the United Nations has done remarkably well \nin supporting self-determination, when it celebrates 70 \nyears of existence next year, this body may be found \nwanting by the people of Palestine. The Israeli-Palestine \nquestion is one of the oldest items on the United \nNations agenda, but progress remains elusive. In the \npast few months in particular, the world has witnessed \na devastating conflict that left a humanitarian crisis \nof shocking proportions. People in Palestine were left \nhomeless, with no medical facilities, no safe drinking \nwater, bereaved and having to care for the wounded \nafter a trail of destructive military actions by Israel.\n\nSouth Africa has condemned the actions of both \nIsrael and Hamas, and we have called for an immediate \ncessation of hostilities. Our strongly held view is \nthat there can be no military solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian question. We should all remain committed \nto the two-State solution, based on the 1967 borders, \nwith Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side in \npeace.\n\nOf concern in this matter has been the helplessness \ndisplayed by the United Nations, especially the Security \nCouncil during the current conflict. The United \nNations has the moral authority and legitimacy to unite \nthe world in promoting the quest for peace, justice and \nself-determination for the people of Palestine, while \naddressing whatever security concerns Israel may have. \nThis body must play its role without fear or favour and \nbe a beacon for all who suffer oppression in the world.\n\n\nLet me reiterate that the seventieth anniversary of \nthe United Nations next year provides an opportunity \nfor us seriously to reflect on the need to reform this \naugust body, moving beyond words to action. Ten years \nago, world leaders celebrating the sixtieth anniversary \nof the United Nations agreed on the need for reform \nof the Security Council in particular. The decision \nremains valid and must be implemented. When we \nconvene here next year, in the seventieth year of the \nUnited Nations, we should be able to adopt a concrete \nprogramme that will guide us towards a strengthened \nUnited Nations and a reformed Security Council. Some \ncontentious aspects of the United Nations system, \nincluding the power of veto and the exclusion of regions \nsuch as Africa from the Security Council, are some of \nthe critical matters that cannot be ignored in the quest \nfor transformation.\n\nAmong the achievements of the Organization in its \nrecent history is the cooperation between the African \nUnion and the United Nations, particularly since the \nformation of the African Union Peace and Security \nArchitecture. In this regard, the full implementation \nof Security Council resolutions 1809 (2008) and 2033 \n(2012), on cooperation between the United Nations \nand regional organizations, particularly the African \nUnion, remains crucial. Progress has been made in a \nnumber of areas where this cooperation is in place, for \nexample in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The \ntwo affected subregional organizations, the Southern \nAfrican Development Community and the International \nConference on the Great Lakes Region, continue to \ntake significant strides with the support of the United \nNations.\n\nThis body celebrated the formation of a new State \nof South Sudan not long ago. Recent developments and \nthe ongoing conflict in South Sudan have resulted in \nloss of life and other dire humanitarian consequences. \nWe will continue to contribute as much as we can to \nfinding solutions working with the African Union and \nthis body. South Sudan should not be allowed to regress.\n\nNext year marks 20 years since the the Fourth \nWorld Conference on Women adopted the Beijing \nPlatform for Action. The anniversary provides an \nopportunity for the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to reflect and take forward the struggle \nfor the emancipation of women from all forms of \ndiscrimination.\n\nLast December, the world descended on South \nAfrica to pay last respects to our beloved Madiba. \nThose who did not come to South Africa honoured \nMadiba in various ways. We will continue to work with \nthe world to promote Madiba\u2019s legacy and passion for \njustice, freedom, equality and human rights. We are \ngrateful to the General Assembly and the President of \nthe Assembly at the sixty-eighth session for the decision \nto establish the United Nations Nelson Rolihlahla \nMandela Prize that will be awarded to an outstanding \nindividual who will have demonstrated a commitment \nto the aims, objectives and principles of the United \nNations Charter. The Prize is a great testament to the \noutstanding individual that Madiba was and will always \nbe.\n\nAs we recommit to the Millennium Development \nGoals, let me once again borrow from the words of \nMadiba uttered on his historic inauguration day in 1994 \nwhen he said:\n\n\u201cWe understand it still that there is no easy \nroad to freedom. We know it well that none of \nus acting alone can achieve success. We must \ntherefore act together as a united people, for \nnational reconciliation, for nation building, for the \nbirth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. \nLet there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, \nwater and salt for all. Let each know that for each \nthe body, the mind and the soul have been freed to \nfulfil themselves.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "We come together at a \ncrossroads between war and peace, between disorder \nand integration, between fear and hope. Around the \nglobe, there are signposts of progress. The shadow of \nthe Second World War that existed at the founding of \nthis institution has been lifted, and the prospect of war \nbetween major Powers reduced. The ranks of Member \nStates have more than tripled, and more people live \nunder Governments that they elected. Hundreds of \nmillions of human beings have been freed from the \nprison of poverty, with the proportion of those living \nin extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy \ncontinues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis \nof our lives.\n\nToday, whether you live in downtown Manhattan or \nin my grandmother\u2019s village more than 200 miles from \nNairobi, you can hold in your hand more information \nthan the world\u2019s greatest libraries. Together, we have \nlearned how to cure disease and harness the power \nof the wind and the sun. The very existence of this \nOrganization is a unique achievement, with the people \nof the world committing to resolve their differences \npeacefully and to solve their problems together. I often \ntell young people in the United States that, despite \nthe headlines, this is the best time in human history \nto be born, for you are more likely than ever before to \nbe literate, to be healthy and to be free to pursue your \ndreams.\n\nAnd yet there is a pervasive unease in our world \u2014 a \nsense that the very forces that have brought us together \nhave created new dangers and made it difficult for any \nsingle nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we \ngather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public \nhealth systems in West Africa and threatens to move \nrapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe \nrecalls the days when large nations trampled small \nones in pursuit of territorial ambitions. The brutality \nof terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the \nheart of darkness.\n\nEach of those problems demands urgent attention. \nBut they are also symptoms of a broader problem: \nthe failure of our international system to keep pace \nwith an interconnected world. We, collectively, have \nnot invested adequately in the public health capacity \nof developing countries. Too often, we have failed \nto enforce international norms when it has been \n\n\n\f\ninconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted \nforcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism and \nhopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many \nparts of the globe.\n\nFellow representatives, we come together as \nUnited Nations with a choice to make. We can renew \nthe international system that has enabled so much \nprogress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back \nby an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our \ncollective responsibility to confront global problems, or \nbe swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. \nAnd for America, the choice is clear \u2014 we choose hope \nover fear. We see the future not as something out of our \ncontrol, but as something we can shape for the better \nthrough concerted and collective effort. We reject \nfatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs. \nWe choose to work for the world as it should be, as our \nchildren deserve it to be.\n\nThere is much that must be done to meet the test \nof this moment. But today I would like to focus on \ntwo defining questions at the root of so many of our \nchallenges. Will the nations represented here today \nbe able to renew the purpose of the United Nations \nfounding, and will we come together to reject the cancer \nof violent extremism?\n\nFirst, all of us \u2014 big nations and small \u2014 must meet \nour responsibility to observe and enforce international \nnorms. We are here because others realized that we \ngain more from cooperation than from conquest. One \nhundred years ago, a World War claimed the lives of \nmany millions, proving that with the terrible power of \nmodern weaponry, the cause of empire ultimately leads \nto the graveyard. It would then take another World War \nto roll back the forces of fascism, the notions of racial \nsupremacy, and form the United Nations to ensure that \nno nation can subjugate its neighbours and claim their \nterritory.\n\nRecently, Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine have \nchallenged that post-war order. Here are the facts. After \nthe people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and \ncalls for reform, their corrupt President fled. Against \nthe will of the Government in Kyiv, Crimea was annexed \nby Russia. Russia poured arms into eastern Ukraine, \nfuelling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed \nthousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from \nareas that those proxy forces controlled, those forces \nrefused to allow access to the crash site for days. When \nUkraine started to reassert control over its territory, \nRussia gave up the pretence of merely supporting the \nseparatists and moved troops across the border.\n\nThat reflects a vision of a world in which might \nmakes right; a world in which one nation\u2019s borders \ncan be redrawn by another and civilized people are \nnot allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones \nbecause of the truth that might be revealed.\n\nAmerica stands for something different. We believe \nthat right makes might, that bigger nations should not \nbe able to bully smaller ones and that people should \nbe able to choose their own future. Those are simple \ntruths, but they must be defended. America and our \nallies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop \ntheir democracy and economy. We will reinforce our \nNATO allies and uphold our commitment to collective \nself-defence. We will impose a cost on Russia for its \naggression, and we will counter falsehoods with the \ntruth. And we call upon others to join us on the right \nside of history, for while small gains can be won at the \nbarrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if \nenough voices support the freedom of nations and the \nright of peoples to make their own decisions.\n\nMoreover, a different path is available \u2014 the path of \ndiplomacy and peace, and the ideals that this institution \nis designed to uphold. The recent ceasefire agreement in \nUkraine offers an opening to achieve those objectives. \nIf Russia takes that path \u2014 a path that for stretches of \nthe post-Cold War period resulted in prosperity for the \nRussian people \u2014 then we will lift our sanctions and \nwelcome Russia\u2019s role in addressing common challenges. \nThat is, after all, what the United States and Russia \nhave been able to do in past years \u2014 from reducing our \nnuclear stockpiles to meeting our obligations under the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to cooperating to \nremove and destroy Syria\u2019s declared chemical weapons. \nThat is the kind of cooperation we are prepared to \npursue again, if Russia changes course.\n\nThat speaks to a central question of our global \nage \u2014 will we solve our problems together in a spirit of \nmutual interest and mutual respect, or will we descend \ninto the destructive rivalries of the past? When nations \nfind common ground \u2014 not simply based on power, but \non principle \u2014 then we can make enormous progress. \nAnd I stand before the Assembly today committed to \ninvesting American strength and to working with all \nnations to address the problems we face in the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\nAs we speak, America is deploying our doctors and \nscientists, supported by our military, to help contain \nthe outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments. But \nwe need a broader effort to stop a disease that could \nkill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, \n\n\n\f\ndestabilize economies and move rapidly across borders. \nIt is easy to see that problem as a distant problem, \nuntil it is not. And that is why we will continue to \nmobilize other countries to join us in making concrete \ncommitments, significant commitments to fight the \noutbreak and enhance our system of global health \nsecurity for the long term.\n\nAmerica is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the \nIranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop \nthe spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace \nand security of a world without them. But that can take \nplace only if Iran seizes this historic opportunity. My \nmessage to Iran\u2019s leaders and people has been simple \nand consistent: do not let this opportunity pass. We can \nreach a solution that meets Iran\u2019s energy needs while \nassuring the world that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is \npeaceful.\n\nAmerica is and will continue to be a Pacific \nPower, promoting peace, stability, and the free flow \nof commerce among nations. But we will insist that \nall nations abide by the rules of the road and resolve \ntheir territorial disputes peacefully, consistent with \ninternational law. That is how the Asia-Pacific region \nhas grown. And that is the only way to protect the \nprogress going forward.\n\nAmerica is committed to a development agenda that \neradicates extreme poverty by 2030. We will do our part \nto help people feed themselves, power their economies \nand care for their sick. If the world acts together, we \ncan make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of \nopportunity and dignity.\n\nAmerica is pursuing ambitious reductions in \nits carbon emissions, and we have increased our \ninvestments in clean energy. We will do our part and \nhelp developing nations do theirs. But the science tells \nus that we can succeed in combating climate change \nonly if we are joined in that effort by every other nation, \nby every major Power. That is how we can protect the \nplanet for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIn other words, on issue after issue, we cannot rely \non a rule book written for a different century. If we lift \nour eyes beyond our borders, if we think globally and \nif we act cooperatively, we can shape the course of this \ncentury as our predecessors shaped the post-World War \nTwo age.\n\nBut as we look to the future, one issue risks starting \na cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress. \nThat is the cancer of violent extremism, which has \nravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. Of course, \nterrorism is not new. Speaking before the Assembly, \nPresident Kennedy put it well:\n\n\u201cTerror is not a new weapon. Throughout \nhistory it has been used by those who could not \nprevail either by persuasion or by example.\u201d \n(A/PV.1013, para. 96)\nIn the twentieth century, terror was used by all \nmanner of groups who failed to come to power through \npublic support. But in this century, we have faced a \nmore lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have \nperverted one of the world\u2019s great religions. With access \nto technology that allows small groups to do great harm, \nthey have embraced a nightmarish vision that would \ndivide the world into adherents and infidels \u2014 killing \nas many innocent civilians as possible and employing \nthe most brutal methods to intimidate people within \ntheir communities.\n\nI have made it clear that America will not base its \nentire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Instead, \nwe have waged a focused campaign against Al-Qaida \nand its associated forces \u2014 taking out their leaders \nand denying them the safe havens they rely on. At the \nsame time, we have reaffirmed again and again that the \nUnited States is not and never will be at war with Islam. \nIslam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to \nlive with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it \ncomes to America and Islam, there is no us and them, \nthere is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans \nare part of the fabric of our country.\n\nSo we reject any suggestion of a clash of \ncivilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the \nmisguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or \ncreate anything and therefore peddle only fanaticism \nand hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that the future \nof humankind depends on our uniting against those \nwho would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or \nsect, race or religion.\n\nBut this is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, \nwe must take concrete steps to address the danger posed \nby religiously motivated fanatics and the trends that \nfuel their recruitment. Moreover, the campaign against \nextremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge. \nFor while we have worked methodically to degrade \nAl-Qaida at its core and have supported a transition to \na sovereign Afghan Government, extremist ideology \nhas shifted to other places, particularly in the Middle \nEast and North Africa, where a quarter of the young \n\n\n\f\npeople have no job, where food and water could grow \nscarce, and where corruption is rampant and sectarian \nconflicts have become increasingly hard to contain.\n\nAs an international community, we must meet this \nchallenge with a focus on four areas. First, the terrorist \ngroup known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL) must be degraded and ultimately destroyed. It \nhas terrorized all those whom it has come across in Iraq \nand Syria. Mothers, sisters and daughters have been \nsubjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children \nhave been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped into \nmass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to \ndeath. In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent \nhuman beings have been beheaded, with videos of \nthe atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the \nworld.\n\nNo god condones such terror. No grievance \njustifies such actions. There can be no reasoning or \nnegotiation with that brand of evil. The only language \nunderstood by killers of that kind is the language of \nforce. So the United States of America will work with \na broad coalition to dismantle that network of death. In \nthis effort, we do not act alone, nor do we intend to send \nUnited States troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, \nwe will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim \ntheir communities. We will use our military might to \nroll back ISIL in a campaign of air strikes. We will train \nand equip forces fighting those terrorists on the ground. \nWe will work to cut off their financing and stop the flow \nof fighters into and out of the region. And more than \n40 nations have already offered to join the coalition. \nToday, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who \nhave joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they \ncan. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause \nwill find that they are increasingly alone. For we will \nnot succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that \nthe future belongs to those who build, not to those who \ndestroy. So that is an immediate challenge, the first one \nwe must meet.\n\nThe second challenge is that it is time for the \nworld, especially Muslim communities, to explicitly, \nforcefully and consistently reject the ideology of \norganizations such as Al-Qaida and ISIL. It is one of \nthe tasks of all great religions to accommodate devout \nfaith with a modern, multicultural world. No children \nare born hating, and no children anywhere should be \neducated to hate other people. There should be no \nfurther tolerance of so-called clerics who call on people \nto harm innocents because they are Jewish or Christian \nor Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the \ncivilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its \nmost fundamental source, and that is the corruption of \nyoung minds by violent ideology.\n\nThat means cutting off the funding that fuels such \nhatred. It is time to end the hypocrisy of those who \naccumulate wealth through the global economy and \nthen siphon funds to those who teach children to tear \nit down. That means contesting the space that terrorists \noccupy, including the Internet and social media. Their \npropaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad \nto fight their wars and has turned students \u2014 young \npeople full of potential \u2014 into suicide bombers. We \nmust offer an alternative vision. That means bringing \npeople of different faiths together. All religions have \nbeen attacked by extremists from within at some point, \nand all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the \nvalue at the heart of all great religions. Do unto your \nneighbour as you would do \u2014 as you would have others \ndo \u2014 unto yourself.\n\nThe ideology of ISIL or Al-Qaida or Boko \nHaram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed \nand confronted and refuted in the light of day. Look \nat the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim \nSocieties, whose purpose Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah \nhas described as \u201cWe must declare war on war, so \nthe outcome will be peace upon peace\u201d. Look at the \nyoung British Muslims who have responded to terrorist \npropaganda by starting the #notinmyname campaign, \ndeclaring that ISIL is hiding behind a false Islam. Look \nat the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together \nin the Central African Republic to reject violence; listen \nto the imam there who said that, while politics may try \nto divide the religious in that country, religion should \nnot be a cause of hate, war, or strife.\n\nLater today, the Security Council will adopt a \nresolution that underscores the responsibility of States \nto counter violent extremism. But resolutions must \nbe followed by tangible commitments, so that we are \naccountable when we fall short. Next year, we should \nall be prepared to announce the concrete steps that \nwe have taken to counter extremist ideologies in our \nown countries \u2014 by getting intolerance out of schools, \nstopping radicalization before it spreads and promoting \ninstitutions and programmes that build new bridges of \nunderstanding.\n\nThirdly, we must address the cycle of conflict, \nespecially sectarian conflict, that creates the conditions \nthat terrorists prey upon. There is nothing new about \n\n\n\f\nwars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of \nvicious sectarian conflict. Today it is violence within \nMuslim communities that has become the source \nof so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge \nthe destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror \ncampaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle \nEast. And it is time that political, civic and religious \nleaders rejected sectarian strife. So let us be clear. This \nis a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in \nSyria has already killed nearly 200,000 people and has \ndisplaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to \nplunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created \na fertile recruiting ground for terrorists, who inevitably \nexport such violence.\n\nThe good news is that we also see signs that the tide \ncan be reversed. We have a new, inclusive Government \nin Baghdad and a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed \nby his neighbours; we see Lebanese factions that reject \nthose who try to provoke war. Such steps must be followed \nby a broader truce. Nowhere is that more necessary \nthan in Syria. Together with our partners, America is \ntraining and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a \ncounterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality \nof the Al-Assad regime. But the only lasting solution \nto Syria\u2019s civil war is political \u2014 an inclusive political \ntransition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of \nall Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, regardless \nof creed.\n\nCynics may argue that such an outcome can never \ncome to pass. But there is no other way for the madness \nin Syria to end, whether one year from now or 10. And it \npoints to the fact that it is time for a broader negotiation \nin the region, in which major Powers address their \ndifferences directly, honestly and peacefully across \nthe table from one another, rather than through gun-\nwielding proxies. I can promise the international \ncommunity that America will remain engaged in the \nregion, and we are prepared to engage in that effort.\n\nMy fourth and final point is a simple one. The \ncountries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on \nthe extraordinary potential of their people, especially \nthe youth. And here I would like to speak directly to \nyoung people across the Muslim world. You come \nfrom a great tradition that stands for education, not \nignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of \nlife, not murder. Those who call you away from that \npath are betraying that tradition, not defending it. You \nhave demonstrated that when young people have the \ntools to succeed \u2014 good schools, education in math \nand science, an economy that nurtures creativity and \nentrepreneurship \u2014 then societies will flourish. So, \nAmerica will partner with those who promote that \nvision.\n\nWhere women are full participants in a country\u2019s \npolitics or economy, societies are more likely to \nsucceed. And that is why we support the participation of \nwomen in parliaments and peace processes, schools and \nthe economy. If young people live in places where the \nonly option is between the dictates of a State or the lure \nof an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism \nstrategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society \nis allowed to flourish \u2014 where people can express their \nviews and organize peacefully for a better life \u2014 then \nyou dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.\n\nAnd such positive change need not come at the \nexpense of tradition and faith. We see that in Iraq, where \na young man started a library for his peers. \u201cWe link \nIraq\u2019s heritage to their hearts\u201d, he said, and \u201cgive them \na reason to stay\u201d. We see it in Tunisia, where secular \nand Islamist parties worked together through a political \nprocess to produce a new constitution. We see it in \nSenegal, where civil society thrives alongside a strong \ndemocratic Government. We see it in Malaysia, where \nvibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony \ninto the ranks of advanced economies. And we see it in \nIndonesia, where what began as a violent transition has \nevolved into a genuine democracy.\n\nUltimately the task of rejecting sectarianism and \nrejecting extremism is a generational one, and a task \nfor the people of the Middle East themselves. No \nexternal power can bring about a transformation of \nhearts and minds. But America will be a respectful \nand constructive partner. We will neither tolerate \nterrorist safe havens nor act as an occupying Power. \nWe will take action against threats to our security and \nour allies, while building an architecture of counter-\nterrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift \nup those who counter extremist ideologies and who \nseek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand \nour programmes to support entrepreneurship and civil \nsociety, education and youth, because ultimately those \ninvestments are the best antidote to violence.\n\nWe recognize as well that leadership will be \nnecessary to address the conflict between Palestinians \nand Israelis. As bleak as the landscape appears, America \nwill not give up on the pursuit of peace. Understand that \nthe situation in Iraq and Syria and Libya should cure \nanybody of the illusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict \n\n\n\f\nis the main source of problems in the region. For far \ntoo long that has been used as an excuse to distract \npeople from problems at home. The violence engulfing \nthe region today has made too many Israelis ready to \nabandon the hard work of peace. And that is something \nworthy of reflection within Israel. Because let us be \nclear: the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not \nsustainable. We cannot afford to turn away from that \neffort \u2014 not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis, \nor when the lives of so many Palestinian children are \ntaken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President, we \nwill stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, \nthe region and the world will be more just and more \nsafe with two States living side by side, in peace and \nsecurity.\n\nSo this is what America is prepared to do: take \naction against immediate threats, while pursuing a \nworld in which the need for such action is diminished. \nThe United States will never shy away from defending \nour interests, but we will also not shy away from the \npromise of this institution and its Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights \u2014 the notion that peace is not merely \nthe absence of war, but the presence of a better life.\n\nI realize that America\u2019s critics will be quick to point \nout that at times we too have failed to live up to our \nideals and that America has plenty of problems within \nits own borders. That is true. In a summer marked by \ninstability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I \nknow the world also took notice of the small American \ncity of Ferguson, Missouri, where a young man was \nkilled and a community was divided. So, yes, we have \nour own racial and ethnic tensions. And, like every \ncountry, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile \nthe vast changes wrought by globalization and greater \ndiversity with the traditions that we hold dear.\n\nBut we welcome the scrutiny of the world, because \nwhat you see in America is a country that has steadily \nworked to address our problems, to make our union \nmore perfect, to bridge the divides that existed at the \nfounding of this nation. America is not the same as it \nwas 100 years ago or 50 years ago or even a decade ago. \nWe fight for our ideals and we are willing to criticize \nourselves when we fall short. We hold our leaders \naccountable and insist on a free press and an independent \njudiciary. We address our differences in the open space \nof democracy, with respect for the rule of law, with a \nplace for people of every race and every religion and \nwith an unyielding belief in the ability of individual \nmen and women to change their communities and their \ncircumstances and their countries for the better.\n\nAfter nearly six years as President, I believe that that \npromise can help light the world. I have seen a longing \nfor positive change \u2014 for peace and for freedom and for \nopportunity and for an end to bigotry \u2014 in the eyes of \nyoung people whom I have met around the globe. They \nremind me that no matter who you are or where you \ncome from or what you look like or what God you pray \nto or whom you love, there is something fundamental \nthat we all share. \n\nEleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the United \nNations and America\u2019s role in it, once asked, \n\n\u201cWhere, after all, do universal human rights \nbegin? In small places, close to home \u2014 so close \nand so small that they cannot be seen on any maps \nof the world. Yet they are the world of the individual \nperson; the neighbourhood he lives in; the school or \ncollege he attends; the factory, farm or office where \nhe works.\u201d\nAround the world, young people are moving forward, \nhungry for a better world. Around the world, in small \nplaces, they are overcoming hatred and bigotry and \nsectarianism. And they are learning to respect each \nother, despite differences.\nThe people of the world now look to us, here, to \nbe as decent and dignified and courageous as they are \ntrying to be in their daily lives. And at this crossroads, \nI can promise the Assembly that the United States \nof America will not be distracted or deterred from \nwhat must be done. We are heirs to a proud legacy of \nfreedom, and we are prepared to do what is necessary \nto secure that legacy for generations to come. I ask \nthat the Assembly join us in this common mission, for \ntoday\u2019s children and tomorrow\u2019s.\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam \nKutesa on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish him \nsuccess in his mission. I would also like to thank His \nExcellency Mr. John Ashe for his work during his \npresidency. And I thank His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to promote and \noperationalize the role of the United Nations.\n\nThe start of this year\u2019s session comes at a time \nwhen recent international developments are affecting \nthe security and safety of all humankind. In that \nregard, it is essential that the United Nations live up \nto its role in the maintenance of international peace \nand security through all the mechanisms and means \nprovided for in the Charter of the United Nations, \nexplore every possible way of preventing conflicts and \naddressing their root causes, and work to settle them \nby peaceful means. We cannot achieve international \npeace and security without a dialogue based on the \nprinciple of equality and compliance with international \nlaw, implementation of the resolutions of international \nlegality and respect for the principles of human rights \nand the rights of peoples.\n\nThe Middle East went through an extremely \ndangerous phase during the recent war on our \nPalestinian brothers. There are no guarantees that it \nwill not recur. Israel continues to persist in its policies \nof occupation and to defy the will of the international \ncommunity by confiscating land in the West Bank and \nbuilding settlements in an effort to perpetuate that \noccupation. Humankind was shocked by the tragic \n\n\nscenes and unprecedented images of destruction during \nthe latest round of aggression targeting civilians in \nGaza. Babies were killed in their mothers\u2019 arms, almost \nhalf a million Palestinians were displaced and the Gaza \nStrip was virtually destroyed when people had hardly \nmanaged to rebuild after the destruction inflicted on \nGaza during the previous war. Under international \nlaw and international humanitarian law, such acts are \ndefined as crimes against humanity. The arrogance \nof power will not prevail over the resistance of the \nPalestinian people. I salute their steadfast resistance in \nthe face of the occupation in Gaza and their insistence \non regaining their legitimate rights. May the souls of \nthe Palestinian martyrs rest in peace.\n\nIsrael must realize that it can achieve security for \nits people only through peace, and that the occupation \nis bound to end. The damage caused by Israel\u2019s repeated \nacts of aggression in the Gaza Strip in recent years, \nthe unjust blockade imposed on it and the destruction \nwreaked on its infrastructure make it incumbent \non the international community to compel Israel to \nimplement internationally agreed-on resolutions, fulfil \nits obligations and hasten to remove every obstacle \nto lifting the blockade and launching the process of \nreconstructionn. The State of Qatar will spare no effort \nto provide assistance for the reconstruction of the Gaza \nStrip, and we urge every country to follow suit.\n\nThe international community\u2019s response to the \naspirations of the Palestinian people to freedom \nand national independence is vital to affirming the \njustice of international legality, especially since the \nquestion of Palestine is the last remaining issue on \nthe decolonization agenda. In that context, temporary \nsolutions and piecemeal settlements have proved useless \nand unacceptable. Israel\u2019s intransigence compels us to \nresort to the United Nations as a framework that can \naccommodate all parties. \n\nThe Security Council should shoulder its moral \nand legal responsibilities by upholding the principles \nof international legality and human rights and avoiding \nthe selectivity that has characterized its approach to \nthis issue in recent times. It should adopt a resolution, \nunder Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, \nforcing Israel to end its occupation of the lands it seized \nin 1967 and to implement the two-State solution agreed \non by the international community, according to a clear \nand time-bound political plan, within the framework of \npeace negotiations leading to a permanent settlement of \nthe Palestinian question through a two-State solution, \nin accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and the \nrelevant internationally legitimate resolutions. The \nworld is duty-bound to persuade the Palestinians that \nthose who killed their children in Gaza will not be \nreceived in diplomatic forums as if they had carried \nout a civilized action because they had bombed \nPalestinians from the air without staining their hands \nwith Palestinian blood.\n\nThe tragedy of the Syrian people, now in its fourth \nyear, represents one of the major challenges in the Middle \nEast. This humanitarian disaster has been exacerbated \nand is becoming increasingly dangerous by the lack of \na clear vision for a solution to the crisis, continued acts \nof murder and destruction, violations of human rights, \nthe terrible human suffering and the displacement \nof nearly half of the Syrian people. This makes it \nincumbent on the international community to strive \nto end the bloodshed and the systematic destruction of\nSyria by a regime that forces its people to choose \nbetween accepting its presence or burning down their \ncountry.\n\nWe have already warned that the continuation of the \nregime\u2019s policy of terrorism, genocide and displacement, \nas well as the failure to provide support to the Syrian \nrevolution when it was still a civilian revolution \ndemanding freedom and dignity, would push many \nSyrians to opt for self-defence. We have also warned \nthe international community from the outset that if no \naction were taken about the situation in Syria, we would \nreach the point at which we now find ourselves. When \nthe Syrian people defended themselves with weapons, \nwe advocated providing them with support before the \nregime destroyed their country and before extremist \norganizations arose and flourished. No red lines were \ndrawn to stop the actions of the Syrian regime. The \nworld remained silent even when Syrian children and \nwomen were killed with chemical weapons and when \nits populated neighbourhoods were levelled with barrel \nbombs. Eventually, the Syrian people found themselves \nstuck between the grip of terrorism of the regime and \nthat of extremist forces that thrived in the swamp of \nviolence. The war of genocide waged and the deliberate \ndisplacement carried out by the regime remain major \ncrimes.\n\nConfronted by this grim reality, the international \ncommunity needs to provide all aspects of humanitarian \naid to the Syrian people inside and outside their areas \nof refuge. We reiterate our call on the Security Council \nto promptly shoulder its legal and humanitarian \n\n\nresponsibilities. It must support the Syrian people \nagainst the two dangers posed by the terrorism and \ncrimes of genocide of the regime, and by the terrorist \nforces that have taken advantage of the prevailing \nmisery, bitterness and the absence of the State and the \ninternational community. The first danger has begotten \nthe second.\n\nMany areas of the world suffer from the terrorism \nbeing perpetrated under different pretexts and slogans \nthat threaten the security and stability of the world and \nhamper the achievement of the desired development. No \ncivilization has been spared terrorism in the modern era. \nThere is no doubt that the most affected communities \nare those in which this evil seed had grown. This \nphenomenon is hostile to the diversity and pluralism \nthat enrich communities. In the case of the affected \nArab and Islamic societies, terrorism affects innocent \npeople, impoverishes our societies by depriving them \nof humanitarian and religious diversity, muzzles the \nreal demands of the peoples, and offends religion with \nits superficial and apostatic interpretations.\n\nTherefore we must all redouble our efforts to fight \nthis phenomenon whatever its forms, target or source \nmight be. It has been proved beyond any doubt that \nterrorism can be defeated only in its social environment. \nIf societies are to stand with us in the fight against \nterrorism, we need to be fair and not push them to \nchoose between terrorism and tyranny, or between \nterrorism and sectarian discrimination. We cannot win \nthe war on terror if peoples are not satisfied that it is \ntheir war and not a war to stabilize a regime that is \noppressing them.\n\nThe Syrian people have suffered from tyranny and \nterrorism. The international community did not heed \nthe cries for help of the Iraqi people, who have been the \nfirst victims of terrorism in Iraq. But those who fought \nterrorism and defeated it found themselves prone \nto marginalization and abuse by terrorist sectarian \nmilitias. It is therefore imperative to persuade the Iraqi \npeople that they will not pay the a thousandfold price, \nand that when they defend their homeland they are \nmerely defending their rights, dignity and freedoms, \nwhich must be guaranteed. This is what the majority \nof the Syrian people must be persuaded of after being \nsoaked in the blood spilled by the Syrian regime for \ndaring to demand freedom and dignity.\n\nIn this context, the international community \nneeds to stand firmly by brotherly Iraq in confronting \nterrorism and ending its ordeal. Preserving its \nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the diversity of \nits sects can be achieved only by defusing sectarian \nconflict and achieving Iraqi reconciliation that lays the \nfoundations for a society free from sectarian and ethnic \nconflicts, with the participation of all political forces, \nwithout exclusion.\n\nIn this context, the international community must \nalso assist fraternal Libya in ending its current ordeal \nby making a serious effort to respect the will of the \nLibyan people and meet their legitimate aspirations \nfor security and stability through reconciliation and \nthe inclusion of all Libyan factions. From this rostrum, \nI call on all Libyan political forces to follow the path \nof national dialogue and to hammer out a formula for \ngovernance that meets the aspirations of the Libyan \npeople, who have sacrificed so much for their freedom.\n\nOn this occasion, I cannot but hail the nascent \nTunisian experience, which augurs well for our future \nand owes its progress to the awareness and unity of the \nTunisians and their insistence on the success of their \nexperiment, despite continuous attempts by Powers that \ndo not want pluralism to succeed in our region. Another \nsuccessful instance of the peaceful transfer of power \nhas been seen in Yemen. We were encouraged by the \noutcome of the national dialogue under the auspices of \nthe United Nations and with the support of the Security \nCouncil, which adopted a resolution emphasizing \ncommitment to the process and condemning those \nundermining its implementation.\n\nBut it would seem that there are forces who are \njoining ranks in an attempt to thwart that experiment. \nSome oppose any change at all and would prefer to turn \nback the hands of the clock; others prefer sectarian \nconflict and sectarian and factional interests over \njustice and good governance for Yemen. Experience \nhas shown that the use of violence and political action \nfrom a factional or sectarian perspective does not lead \nto a change towards a better system of governance, but \nposes a threat to the political entity itself.\n\nWe call on our Yemeni brothers to preserve the \nachievements of the young people of Yemen, and \nthose of national dialogue and wisdom, and not to \nabandon what they have accomplished. They must not \nallow anyone to drag them onto the path of sectarian \nviolence. We also call on the United Nations to work \non implementing its decisions on the achievements of \nthe national dialogue, including rebuilding the army so \nthat it can defend the legitimate institutions and stop \nthe phenomenon of armed militias in Yemen. It has \n\n\nbecome clear that such forces would lead to civil strife \nand derail the process of peaceful transition.\n\nMany countries of the world still suffer from \npoverty and face difficulties in promoting their \ndevelopment at the desired pace. This holds true for the \nnew post-2015 sustainable development goals, which \nconstitute a common vision for future generations. I \nstress that the State of Qatar will pursue its efforts to \nbuild a partnership with the United Nations in order \nto adopt a post-2015 development plan that meets the \naspirations of the peoples of all countries and regional \nblocs.\n\nI would also like to note that the State of Qatar \nhas made progress in its national development plans \nand strengthened its regional and global partnerships, \nas confirmed by the United Nations 2014 Human \nDevelopment Index. The State of Qatar has been \nranked thirty-first globally, and today we continue the \nimplementation of the comprehensive national strategy \nfor human development based on the Qatar Vision 2030, \naimed at achieving development in various fields.\n\nThe State of Qatar will pursue its active policy \nof providing a space for dialogue in areas of conflict \nand for mediation between the various parties, as we \nbelieve in solving conflicts by peaceful means and \nhave established a tradition of peaceful mediation. We \nwill continue to provide a platform for dialogue among \npolitical currents, cultures and religions.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \ncommitment of the State of Qatar to work with the \nUnited Nations to address common challenges and \nachieve the goals we all seek.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \non behalf of the Republic of the Sudan, I would like to \nconvey to Mr. Sam Kutesa our sincerest congratulations \non his election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. I also extend thanks and \nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for \nhis wise and patient conduct of the deliberations of \nthe previous session. We hope that this session will \nculminate in concrete results on important, universal \nissues, in particular the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the implementation \nof the post-2015 development agenda, which is a major \ntopic of discussion at this session.\n\nToday, I address the Assembly at a time when the \nSudan is on the threshold of an important new phase of \ncomprehensive political participation that excludes no \nparty, faction or group. On 27 January, His Excellency \nthe President of the Republic of the Sudan, President \nOmer Al-Bashir, launched an initiative for an inclusive \nnational dialogue, calling on the representatives of \nthe Sudanese people to sit at the same table to discuss \nsix major priorities: unity and peace, the economy, \nfundamental freedoms and rights, their identity, \nforeign relations and the issues of governance and \nthe implementation of the outcomes of the national \ndialogue.\n\nThe President\u2019s appeal enjoyed an unprecedented \nresponse on the part of all political forces in the Sudan \nand the international community in view of the fact that \nboth the Government and the opposition were convinced \nthat dialogue was the only option at that time, as agreed \nby the people of the Sudan. There followed a succession \nof organizational and procedural consultations in order \nto translate the statement of His Excellency the President \ninto concrete steps. The initiative even found a positive \nresponse among the armed groups that still existed. I \nwould like to affirm the State\u2019s intention to move the \ndialogue forward in the hope of achieving a national \nconsensus on the political future of the country.\n\nIn that regard, we greatly appreciate the ongoing \nefforts of the African Union and the African Union \nHigh-level Implementation Panel on the three major \npolitical, security and economic tracks. We call on \nthe international community to promote a positive and \nconstructive role in support of the Sudanese economy, \nin particular by lifting the unilateral sanctions, and by \ncancelling the Sudan\u2019s accumulated debt, in line with \nthe aspirations for broader political participation.\n\nThe Sudan has continued to play an effective \nand positive role at the regional level on the African \ncontinent, with a view to establishing peace and \nstability in neighbouring States. When a conflict \nbroke out in the Republic of South Sudan, the Sudan \nadhered to the principle of non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of that country. The Sudan was the first \nState to provide humanitarian aid to those affected in \nSouth Sudan, and continues to do so. The Sudan is \nparticipating effectively with the Intergovernmental \nAuthority on Development so as to put an end to the war \nand to conclude a reconciliation agreement between the \ntwo parties to the conflict in South Sudan. My country \nhas received more than 100,000 internally displaced \npersons from South Sudan.\n\nIn that context, we recall the Sudan\u2019s constructive \nefforts for the restoration of peace and stability in the \n\n\nCentral African Republic, thereby complementing other \ninternational and regional efforts. The Sudan is also \nactively working with Libya\u2019s neighbours in assisting \nthe Libyan parties to reach an agreement on a solution \nto the Libyan crisis. Internationally, I underscore the \ntrilateral cooperation among the Sudan, Ethiopia and \nthe Arab Republic of Egypt in order to ensure the \ncommon enjoyment of the waters of the Blue Nile and \nto avert any negative repercussions in that country.\n\nIn that regard, we also stress the efforts of the \nSudan in the area of border control and demarcation \nwith neighbouring States in order to strengthen the \nborder posts and border monitoring and security \nand to prevent transnational crime, including illegal \nimmigration and the illegal transfer of small arms \nand light weapons. In that context, we appreciate the \nexperience of the joint border forces of the Sudan and \nChad, the Sudan and the Central African Republic, and \nthe Sudan and Libya as models of successful regional \nsecurity cooperation between neighbouring States in \nthe interests of peace and stability. In that connection, I \nwould like to recall that in mid-October 2014, the Sudan \nwill host a conference, in partnership with Italy, the \nEuropean Union and the African Union, on preventing \nillegal immigration, smuggling and human trafficking.\n\nConcerning the situation in the Middle East, the \nquestion of Palestine has continued to present a real \nchallenge for the international community for decades. \nIt has now reached a stage that requires the exceptional \nand prompt action of the international community in \norder to contain the situation and to move it forward \ntowards sustainable peace in the Middle East, through \nthe achievement of the legitimate and urgent demands \nof the Palestinian people, in particular the protection \nand reconstruction of what the Israeli war machine has \ndestroyed. The entire world\u2019s ongoing disregard for the \ngenocidal war in Palestine and its failure to intervene to \nprotect the Palestinians and their rights fuel extremism \nin the region and throughout the world. As long as \nthe Palestinian people opt for a peaceful solution, it is \nimperative to support that direction in order to prevent \ndespair from spreading and the pursuit of destructive \nsolutions.\n\nWe fully accept and support the theme of the \npost-2015 development agenda as a major topic for \ndiscussion at this session. However, there remain only \na few months until the end of 2014 and we still have not \nachieved all the MDGs. We nevertheless remain very \nhopeful that we can overcome the obstacles that have \nimpeded us from achieving those Goals and that the \ndeliberations will culminate in a thorough preparation \nfor the development of viable post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment goals.\n\nIn the United Nations Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), adopted in 2000, the Heads of State \nand Government unanimously agreed a set of principles \nand goals that laid the foundation for an international \npartnership to put an end to people\u2019s suffering and \npoverty. The year 2015 was designated as the deadline \nfor eradicating poverty and for ensuring well-being. \nHowever, the achievements reached on the eve of the \nend of 2014 are still short of our aspirations, since \npoverty, suffering, need, environmental deterioration \nand unemployment persist.\n\nThe agreement of the world\u2019s leaders with regard \nto mitigating poverty requires that the obstacles to \nachieving such development be overcome. However, the \ndevelopment partners that drafted the Declaration have \nadopted actions that run counter to its provisions and \nto human rights. Such coercive measures as unilateral \nsanctions outside the framework of international \nlegitimacy have flagrantly damaged the content of \nthe Millennium Declaration. That has had an adverse \nimpact on the noble principles and purposes of the \nDeclaration.\n\nIndications of the current situation in human \ndevelopment are that the Sudan has achieved concrete \nprogress in several fields, especially in peace, health \ncare, education and the standard of living. While \nacknowledging uneven degrees of progress between \nrural and urban areas, the Sudan has implemented a \nfederal system to promote the role of local communities. \nHowever, such progress has been greatly damaged as a \nresult of coercive and unilateral measures illegally and \nunjustifiably imposed against the Sudan, which have \naggravated and delayed initiatives, thereby negating \nthe Sudan\u2019s role, and which continue to shackle the \ncountry\u2019s economy. In that regard, I recall that the \ninternational consensus, achieved after the referendum \nin South Sudan that led to the separation of South Sudan, \nhad been to cancel the Sudan\u2019s debts. A number of \nStates were assigned to do so in order to promote peace \nand development after the end of the war. However, that \nagreement has not been implemented so far.\n\nIn the Sudan, in the context of our established \ncommitment to the MDGs, we have formulated the \nrequired policies, which have gone a long way towards \npromoting several poverty-eradication projects and \n\n\ninitiatives, such as the establishment of a funding \nportfolio for small families and those with limited \nincome; programmes to recruit graduates and young \npeople in capital projects; the promotion of the role \nof women in governance and management; and the \nstrenghtening of the role of the zakat fund in promoting \nquick and short-term funds and other projects, which \nhave resulted in helping thousands of families to play \na productive role in paying the zakat. That is now \nunder consideration by the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation, so that it can be applied throughout the \nIslamic States.\n\nHowever, we must affirm from this rostrum \nthe importance of the commitment to a common \nresponsibility in achieving development objectives, \nbecause the international community must support \nand assist developing countries, especially the least \ndeveloped, which represent the segment more in need \nof support and capacity-building. That is why, in the \nlight of declining development assistance, we hope that \ndeliberations at this session culminate in our taking \npractical steps in financing development for developing \ncountries, especially those emerging from conflict. On \nthe basis of those measures and in order to guarantee \nserving the objectives of development, my delegation \nfeels it important to include the following requirements \nin the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nFirst, we should consider debt cancellation, providing \nthe necessary funding and renouncing discrimination \nand exclusionary political considerations. Secondly, \nwe should facilitate the transfer of development-\nrelated technology and information through advanced \ncommunications technology. Thirdly, we should \nsuspend coercive measures, sanctions and all kinds of \nillegal measures imposed unilaterally by States outside \nthe framework of international legitimacy. Fourthly, \nwe should launch feasible initiatives in North-South \nrelations, such as funding food-security projects, \nwhere my country can play a pioneering and effective \nrole in their success. Fifthly, we should help the United \nNations and its various organs to play an effective role \nin achieving their desired development objectives by \nproviding the mechanisms enabling them to do so.\n\nThis year\u2019s general debate coincides with the \nUnited Nations Climate Summit, the outcomes of which \nwe hope will provide a strong impetus for the current \nefforts to address climate change and to turn the grave \nchallenge facing humankind into an opportunity for \njoint action in order to achieve a binding international \ncommitment to supplement the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, take \npractical steps towards a green economy, and reduce the \ncarbon emissions that threaten the safety of our planet. \nIn that regard, the Sudan, a State affected by the climate \nchange phenomenon, accords special importance to \nthe environment issue. We recall that the drought and \ndesertification that have hobbled Africa north of the \nequator are the living examples of the effcts of climate \nchange, which have led to tribal conflicts over sources \nof water and pasture. The Sudan\u2019s involvement in the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme over the past \n40 years has been consistent with our concern in that \nregard.\n\nThe Sudan remains in an effective global \npartnership in the fight against terrorism at the national \nlevel. We have come a long way in harmonizing our \nlaws with international legislation and in working with \ninternational law and instruments relevant to fighting \nterrorism. We commit ourselves to those international \nlaws and reaffirm our commitment against all forms \nand manifestations of terrorism. At the same time, we \ncondemn any attempt to identify terrorism with any \nreligion, race or culture and call for the redoubling of \nefforts to enhance international and regional cooperation \nto stand up to terrorism. The phenomenon of terrorism \ncan be addressed and overcome only through a balanced \ninternational system based on equality and respect \nfor the established principles of international law and \nthe Charter of the United Nations. In that context, we \nfeel that any unilateral action based on politicizing \nterrorism will not eliminate but exacerbate it. There are \nnumerous instances supporting that conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the Sudan affirms that international \nand regional security is an integrated, interconnected \nsystem and that the Organization has invested enormous \nefforts and resources in peacekeeping operations. It is \nnow time to do so, and we have significant experience \nin that regard. It is time for the Organization to invest \nin peacemaking and peacebuilding by supporting \ndeveloping countries and building the capacities of least \ndeveloped countries so that they can achieve the MDGs \nand peace and development can supplement each other."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to address the General Assembly on behalf of His \nExcellency Mr. Armando Emilio Guebuza, President of \nthe Republic of Mozambique, who could not attend this \ngathering owing to national commitments. However, he \nwishes the General Assembly successful deliberations \nat this session.\n\nI take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Sam \nKutesa, a distinguished son of our sisterly country, \nUganda, on his unanimous election to preside over this \nsession of the General Assembly. We firmly believe \nthat his vision, wisdom and leadership will guide us \nto a comprehensive and results-oriented transformative \ndevelopment agenda. I assure him of the full support \nand collaboration of the delegation of Mozambique in \nthe fulfilment of his noble mission.\n\nI also wish to pay tribute to Ambassador John \nWilliam Ashe for his devotion and for the pragmatic \nmanner in which he presided over the sixty-eighth \nsession of this body, and for his relentless efforts \nconstructively to guide the ongoing debate on the \narchitecture of the next development agenda.\n\nThe year 2015 will be a historic one, since the \nUnited Nations will reach the landmark celebration \nof its seventieth anniversary. That celebration will be \nenriched by the goal set in the year 2000 to halve poverty \nrates in the world by the year 2015, the conclusion \nof the next development agenda, and the adoption of \na new framework for climate change. In that regard, \nwe welcome the theme for this session, \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d, as it will enhance the ongoing \ndeliberations under the United Nations umbrella on the \nnext development agenda, galvanized by regional and \nsubregional visions on that important topic.\n\nIn our deliberations, the results and challenges \nexperienced in the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) will undoubtedly be \nreferenced in shaping the next development agenda. We \nrecognize that much has been done in the framework \nof the MDGs. However, apart from accelerating the \nachievement of all goals, it is important to guarantee \nthe sustainability of those that were achieved and \naccelerate the implementation of those that are still \nlagging behind. It is our strong belief that the principle \nof inclusiveness must also be taken into consideration \nin order to build a common vision and to ensure \nglobal commitments and shared responsibilities in the \nimplementation of the next development agenda.\n\nTo that end, Mozambique undertook a national \nconsultation process on the post-2015 development \nagenda, a process that echoes our vision that \nsustainable development can be achieved only with \na shared responsibility between Governments, civil \nsociety and the private sector. Mozambique\u2019s national \n\nconsultation process resulted in a robust call for the \nnext development agenda to list the eradication of \npoverty as its overarching objective. To achieve that, it \nshould ensure the promotion of equitable, sustainable \nand inclusive economic growth, focusing on women \nand youth.\n\nThe consultation also emphasized the need for the \neradication of poverty and hunger, translated into the \nimprovement of living standards through access to \nbetter social services such as education, health, social \nwelfare, safe drinking water, sanitation and energy; \nthe preservation of peace and political stability, the \npromotion of democracy and the protection of human \nrights; economic diversification and transformation to \nspeed up technological modernization in sectors such \nas agriculture, industry, tourism and infrastructures; \nthe protection of marine and land biodiversity, \nincluding the sustainable use of natural resources; \neffective partnership for development, particularly for \naccess to science, technology and innovation; further \nenhancement of North-South cooperation, in the \nframework of global partnership in order to commit the \ndeveloped countries to meeting their internationally \nagreed development goals obligations; the strengthening \nof South-South cooperation; and, finally, agreement \non a common methodology to monitor and evaluate \nnational progress.\n\nIn addition, the experiences and challenges we faced \nin the implementation of the MDGs \u2014 particularly in \nthe accomplishment of Goal 8, \u201cA global partnership \nfor development\u201d \u2014 underline the need for a greater \ncommitment on the part of our development partners \nto increase their official development assistance, and \nfor funding climate resilience and disaster-prevention \nefforts in developing countries. A transformative post-\n2015 development agenda should include the need to \nstrengthen its financing mechanisms, concomitant \nwith the need to raise the contribution for domestic \nfinancing. Those expectations coincide with the \nemerging common vision at the subregional, regional \nand global levels. Therefore, we have a premonition \nthat the agenda will be adequately inclusive and bring \nthe much-needed transformation to deliver a world that \nis truly fit for all.\n\nAt this critical juncture, the successful conclusion of \nthe Doha Development Round is a matter of urgency. Its \ncontribution to the materialization of the development \nagenda as a whole cannot be overemphasized. In that \nregard, we are encouraged by the attempts of the World \nTrade Organization to restore the Doha negotiations \nand by the adoption of the Bali package, which are \nfundamental steps in the architecture of the Doha \nRound.\n\nWe are also encouraged by the positive trends in \nthe development of Africa. As the Secretary-General \nstates in his report on the work of the Organization \n(A/69/1), Africa continues to make steady development \ngains. Economic growth reached 4 per cent in 2013 and \nis projected to reach 5.3 per cent in 2014. Foreign direct \ninvestment increased, and substantial progress has \nbeen made towards the attainment of the MDGs.\n\nIf those positive developments are to be sustained, \na transformative development agenda should reflect \nAfrica\u2019s priorities and special needs, as expressed in its \nCommon Position on the post-2015 development agenda. \nIn addition, that encouraging environment can be \npossible only in the context of peace, political stability, \ndemocracy and respect for human rights. Therefore, we \nregret that conflict prevention, peacekeeping and the \nrebuilding of war-torn States remain among the most \ncomplex challenges facing the United Nations and the \ninternational community at large.\n\nIndeed, this session takes place in the context \nof grave instability and conflicts in the world, with \nenormous economic costs and severe humanitarian \nconsequences that are unacceptable. Additionally, \nthe complexity of some conflicts poses a challenge to \nthe authority of the United Nations and consequently \nundermines the founding principles of the Organization \nas well as the role of multilateralism in addressing \nglobal concerns.\n\nWe have been challenged by the dramatic evolution \nin the strands of terrorism threats, which spare no part \nof the world. Therefore, Mozambique welcomes the \nadoption, at the 7272nd meeting of the Security Council, \nheld on 24 September, of resolution 2178 (2014), which \ncalls for an urgent boost in international cooperation to \nprevent the support and flow of terrorist fighters to and \nfrom conflict zones.\n\nAs we craft our collective strategy to deal with \nall forms and manifestation of that human scourge, \nwe should not lose sight of the following elements. \nFirst is the need to strengthen multilateral approaches \nin full compliance with the Charter of the United \nNations. Secondly, the root causes of terrorism must \nbe addressed, as that scourge cannot and should not be \nassociated with any religion, nationality or civilization. \n\nThirdly, it is necessary to address the underlying \nconditions, such as poverty, injustice, social exclusion \nand marginalization, that serve as fertile ground for \nextremist ideologies to breed and thrive.\n\nIn an interdependent and globalized world, \nmultilateralism refers to the collective and cooperative \nactions needed to address global challenges in a \ntransparent, inclusive and effective manner, thereby \ncontributing to order, stability and predictability. In \nthat context, the United Nations must be strengthened \nin order to continue effectively to play its role as the \nepicentre of multilateralism. Today more than ever \nbefore, we must take concrete actions to reinforce the \nstrategic role of the United Nations in the architecture \nof the global world.\n\nNotwithstanding the prevailing challenges to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, we are \nencouraged by the efforts in place for the restoration of \npeace and stability in Mali, Somalia, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, \nthe Sudan and South Sudan. We are also encouraged \nby the latest developments in Guinea-Bissau as a \nresult of the general elections that prompted the \npromising first steps towards much-needed political \nstability \u2014 a precondition for that sisterly country to \nprogress towards socioeconomic development. These \nachievements call our attention to the importance \nof cooperation and coordination between the United \nNations and the African Union and with the subregional \nbodies in effectively addressing the range of conflict-\nmanagement problems through preventive diplomacy \nand mediation initiatives that allow for rapid responses \nto regional and subregional crises.\n\nThe principle of the right to self-determination \ncontinues to be central to the full enjoyment of human \nrights. In that context, the United Nations ought to \ncontinue to be engaged in the fulfilment of those \nrights by the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara. \nMozambique reiterates its full support for a just and \nlasting solution to the problem of Palestine through \npeaceful means, in accordance with international law \nand all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we are encouraged \nto note the initiative taken by the Chairperson of \nthe African Union in appointing His Excellency \nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, former President of the \nRepublic of Mozambique, as a special envoy to the five \npermanent members of the Security Council plus Spain, \nin an effort to step up the search for a solution that will \nensure the fulfilment of the right of the Saharan people \nto self-determination, for which Mozambique reaffirms \nits unconditional support.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, \nthe advent of 2015 represents a historic opportunity for \nthe United Nations to reshape global commitments in \nmany ways. As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \nof the Organization, we must use the momentum to take \nconcrete steps to accelerate, in a sustained manner, the \nongoing process of reforms in the Organization, in \nparticular the reform of the Security Council.\n\nThe inability of the United Nations to solve conflict \nsituations and political instability in the Middle East \nand Eastern Europe poses a challenge to its authority \nas the universal entity and multilateral political forum \nfor fostering dialogue in a multilateral framework. The \nsituation is worsened by the lack of substantive progress \nin the reform of the Security Council, almost 15 years \nafter the international community recommitted itself to \nthat important endeavour. It is our hope that at its sixty-\nninth session the General Assembly will deliver the \nmuch-awaited reform to democratize its representation \nand working methods and to strengthen its role in \nconflict prevention and the promotion of international \npeace and security.\n\nFreedom of choice with regard to political systems \nand to trade is an inalienable right of all States, \nirrespective of their size. In that connection, the need to \nbring to an end the economic, commercial and financial \nembargo imposed by the United States of America \nagainst Cuba continues to be a matter of concern, for it \nis politically motivated and hinders the socioeconomic \ndevelopment of Cuba. For those reasons, Mozambique \njoins all those countries that demand the immediate \ntermination of that unfair unilateral measure.\n\nMozambique is fully committed to the global \nagenda for peace and security, democracy and \nsustainable development. At the national level that \ncommitment is translated into our political will to \nstrengthen democracy in the country and to adopt a \npoverty-reduction strategy that is people-centred and \npromotes sustainable development. The regularity \nwith which elections at different levels are held shows \nour unquestionable determination to consolidate the \ndemocratic system and defend its underlying values. As \na result, on 15 October Mozambique will hold its fifth \nmultiparty general elections to elect the President and \nthe Parliament, and its second elections for provincial \nparliaments.\n\nIn the economic sphere, Mozambique has enjoyed \nsteady economic growth for more than a decade. \nCoupled with the support of our development partners, \nincluding the United Nations, that has allowed for an \nimprovement in social services delivery and enabled \nus to be on track to attain the majority the MDGs. In \naddition, recently discovered natural resources represent \na challenge and an opportunity to further advance \nnational socioeconomic progress. The development \nof new sources of clean and renewable energy such \nas bio-fuels is a priority for the Government, and due \nattention is being paid to prevent competition with \nfood-production initiatives.\n\nTherefore, we are emphasizing the following \nareas: the improvement of agriculture production and \nproductivity in a sector that will continue to play a \nkey role in our development efforts; human capital \ndevelopment to address the new emerging economic \nchallenges; and the promotion of a strong private sector \nto take advantage of the opportunities brought about by \nthe discovery and exploitation of natural resources. It \nis our firm conviction that, with peace and stability, we \nwill continue successfully to address the development \nchallenges facing Mozambique, which have poverty \neradication and sustainable development at their \nepicentre.\n\nFinally, as part of our commitment to peace and \nstability, in June Mozambique hosted the third Review \nConference of the States Parties to the Convention on \nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production \nand Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \nDestruction, also known as the Ottawa Convention. \nI should like to take this opportunity to thank all \nparticipants as well as all partners that contributed \nto making that event a success, because it was. We \nare engaged in continuing our efforts to declare the \ncountry free of landmines and thus to contribute to the \nfulfilment of one of the most important steps in our \nobligations under the Convention.\n\nTo conclude, I wish to reiterate Mozambique\u2019s \ncommitment to continue to be engaged in international \nefforts to address current global problems.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin my remarks by conveying our \n\ngreetings to Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. At the same time, I \nwish to express our appreciation to Mr. John Ashe for \nhis recognized leadership and exceptional performance \nas President at the sixty-eighth session. I should \nalso like to take the opportunity to congratulate the \nSecretary-General for his stewardship and especially \nfor the success of the recent United Nations Climate \nSummit 2014.\n\nSince September 2013, when the President of \nGuatemala, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, addressed the General \nAssembly (see A/68/PV.12), 12 months have passed with \nsignificant progress for Guatemala in three priority \nareas of our domestic policy, in spite of our having to \nface some new challenges, including a recent prolonged \ndrought.\n\nFirst, I can report that we have advanced in the \nbattle against chronic malnutrition among children. \nAccording to an independent investigation, in one year, \nthe program Zero Hunger has succeeded in reducing \nchronic malnutrition on the same scale as that achieved \nduring the past decade, that is, by almost 2 per cent. \nThat means that, should that trend be maintained, \nby the end of this Administration we will have been \nable to reduce the rate of chronic malnutrition beyond \nthat achieved since 1985, proving that democracy and \nappropriate policies would have enabled us to make \nprogress for Guatemalan children.\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that the Administration \nof President P\u00e9rez Molina has also advanced in \ncomplying with the Pact for Peace, Security and \nJustice. For the third consecutive year, the number \nof homicides in Guatemala has decreased, with a \ncumulative contraction of 25 per cent between 2011 \nand 2014. With that, we are coming closer to achieving \nthe same levels of security recorded after the Peace \nAccords were signed in 1996. That progress shows that \nthe measures taken are producing the expected results \nand that Guatemalan democracy is slowly winning its \nbattle against crime and impunity, in the framework of \nrespect for the law and compliance with human rights.\n\nWith regard to that second achievement, once more \nwe express our appreciation for the support received \nfrom the International Commission against Impunity \nin Guatemala (CICIG), an entity that has strengthened \ncriminal prosecution against mafia networks, some \nof which even infiltrated the security and justice \nestablishment. As the final year of the mandate of CICIG \napproaches, after nearly eight years of cooperation \nwith three democratically elected Governments, our \nassessment is that international cooperation programme, \nsupported by the United Nations, was fully justified, \nsince Guatemalan institutions today are better prepared \nto take on their constitutional role.\n\nMoreover, this last year will be critical to \nensuring the institutional sustainability of the judicial \ninvestigations and procedures already under way. \nWe thank the United Nations and the international \ncommunity for joining us and leaving that great \nlegacy for Guatemala. Our country will now have the \nresponsibility of strengthening a system of security and \njustice capable of reducing impunity and ensuring the \ntotal separation between criminal networks and our \npublic institutions.\n\nA third advancement that I would like to share \nwith the Assembly has to do with competitiveness and \nthe business climate. In the past two years we have \nadvanced eight steps in the Global Competitiveness \nIndex, established by the World Economic Forum. In \nfact, the World Bank has highlighted us for the second \nconsecutive year as one of the most reformed countries \nin the world in terms of improving the business climate, \njumping 19 positions in the respective report. That \nis due to the actions of the present Administration \nin the framework of the Pact for Oversight and \nCompetitiveness.\n\nThat improvement in the business climate is \nabove all the result of administrative improvements \nthat have reduced bureaucratic procedures, supported \nadditionally by a progressive improvement in the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure. In addition, as we informed \nthe Climate Change Summit, our commitment \nregarding economic progress is made within the context \nof increasing sustainability. The change in the energy \nmatrix towards more sustainable and environmentally \nfriendly energy sources and away from fossil fuels, \nwhich produce greenhouse gases, is being achieved by \nbringing into the system more plants that depend on \nthe sustainable use of water, geothermal sources, solar \nenergy and even natural gas.\n\nIn that context, we have gone ahead with various \nstrategic agreements with our neighbouring countries. \nFor example, with Mexico, we can report on the projects \nto reconstruct and modernize border crossings on land \nand the signing of a historic agreement for a project \nthat will transport gas from the Gulf of Mexico to \nGuatemala and all of Central America. With Belize, we \nare moving forward and have negotiated 15 important \n\nbilateral agreements in all areas, which we will sign \nin December. They will strengthen the relations not \nonly between our Governments but also between our \npeoples. In the Central American Integration System, \nwe are making progress in consolidating our integration \nprocess, and the next goal is to establish a customs \nunion. In addition, relations between Central America \nand the Caribbean are becoming increasingly intensive, \nguaranteeing greater markets and improved economic \nand political relations among our countries.\n\nIn the context of advances in the social, economic, \nsecurity and justice areas, we cannot forget some \nchallenges that have gained a higher profile during the \ncurrent year. In that regard, I must refer to the crisis \nof the Central American child migrants on the border \nbetween the United States and Mexico. The crisis, \nprovoked by diverse factors in both Central America \nand the United States, has alerted us to the need to move \nmore quickly on the path towards greater prosperity, in \nparticular for children and adolescents.\n\nWe trust that the people and Government of \nthe United States understand that the migrant crisis \nrequires a strategic response that attacks the structural \nroots of the phenomenon and provides sustained \nactions. That implies working together to promote \ndevelopment and prosperity in Guatemala, Honduras \nand El Salvador and intelligent management of seasonal \nwork for migrants that both satisfies the demands of \nthe labour market in the United States and provides for \nworkers from Central America. It is also important to \nmake the necessary efforts to regulate the situation of \nundocumented persons in the United States. Above all, \nmigrants must not be criminalized, because migration \nis neither a sin nor a crime. It is the networks of human \ntraffickers that are criminal, promoting corruption, \nextortion, kidnapping and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the same vein, I cannot fail to mention the \nchallenge posed by the shortage of rain this year in all \nthe Central American region. The drought has led to the \nloss of crops of basic foods for hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies, and addressing the food crisis will incur a cost \nof close to $50 million for Guatemala alone during the \nnext eight months. It is clear that the drought is a result \nof climate change and that, without decisive action by \nour Government and the solidarity of the international \ncommunity, many families will find themselves in a \nvery vulnerable situation due to hunger. The speeches \nduring the Climate Change Summit must translate \ninto direct humanitarian assistance that reaches the \nmost needy communities in Central America and the \nCaribbean. It is time to transform rhetoric into action.\n\nI would like to mention three important processes \ndriving the United Nations that Guatemala strongly \nsupports.\n\nFirst is putting together a post-2015 development \nagenda that must clearly embrace inclusive and \nsustainable development goals, including those related \nto promoting justice for all. In that context, we must \nalso incorporate specific goals to avoid man-made \nclimate change.\n\nSecondly, Guatemala is committed to supporting \nthe 2016 special session of the General Assembly \nto discuss the world drug problem. President P\u00e9rez \nMolina, together with other Presidents of the Western \nHemisphere, is determined to promote, through \nleadership, a frank and sincere debate on this issue, \nutilizing as a main reference the two declarations \nemanating from the General Assembly of the \nOrganization of American States during the past 18 \nmonths. During the most recent extraordinary session, \nheld a few days ago in my country, I was charged with \ntransmitting to the presidency of this General Assembly \nand to the United Nations Commission on Drugs and \nCrime the text of the resolution, which I will do in due \ntime. Our focus must be comprehensive, objective and \nevidence-based. And our goals must be realistic and \nmeasurable \u2014 no more dead products of the war against \ndrugs, no more false promises. A comprehensive focus \nis necessary.\n\nThirdly, Guatemala will follow up on the resolution \nand recommendations of the World Conference on \nIndigenous Peoples (resolution 69/2) and work to see \nthat the world recognizes the rights of the indigenous \npeoples as one of the basic platforms of the international \nlegal architecture of human rights.\n\nLike many of the heads of delegation who preceded \nme in speaking, I view with growing concern the \ndeteriorating security landscape facing various parts of \nthe globe. The exceptional cruelty of militant jihadist \ngroups leaves us astonished, and we energetically \ncondemn those crimes. We support all measures to \ncombat them, including in particular the elimination of \nthe root causes that lead many people to those levels of \nfanaticism.\n\nWe are also profoundly troubled by the instability \nin the Middle East, especially by the prolonged conflict \nin Syria, which has already taken an immense toll in \n\nlives and human suffering. We are concerned that in \nCentral Europe principles enshrined in the Charter \nof the United Nations, such as respect for territorial \nintegrity, are being put to the test. We also remain \nconcerned about tensions in various countries on the \nAfrican continent and on the Korean peninsula.\n\nWe believe that the United Nations offers the ideal \nvenue in which to address those conflicts and tensions, \nand we reiterate our hope that dialogue, agreement \nand preventive diplomacy will take precedence over \nthe use of force. In that respect, we pin our hopes on \na negotiated outcome of the long-standing conflict \nbetween Israel and Palestine with the emergence of two \nStates, living in peace within secure borders.\n\nI end my remarks by repeating what President \nOtto P\u00e9rez Molina said last year to the Assembly, \nwhen he congratulated the United Nations system for \nits ongoing commitment to seek peace and justice \nworldwide. Guatemala aligns itself with that statement \nand those same goals and can affirm with pride that we \nare and will always be a country that is guided by the \nprinciples set out in the Charter of the Organization. \nThat sentiment is reflected in our commitment to \npeacekeeping operations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is a singular honour \nand privilege for me to address this gathering of the \ninternational community. Allow me, on behalf of His \nExcellency the President of the Republic of Botswana, \nLieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, to \njoin other delegations in extending our warmest \ncongratulations to the President on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. We are confident that his vast experience and \ndedicated service to the Government and people of \nUganda will contribute significantly to the successful \nconclusion of this session. My delegation and I wish him \nevery success as he embarks on this new responsibility \nof steering the work of the sixty-ninth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. We also extend fitting tribute to his \npredecessor, His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe, \nfor his sterling leadership of the sixty-eighth session of \nthe General Assembly. We commend him for his tireless \nefforts to overcome many of the challenges confronting \nthe international community today.\n\nMy delegation welcomes the theme that the President \nhas chosen for the current general debate, namely, \n\u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative \npost-2015 development agenda\u201d. We consider it both \npertinent and timely, especially as it coincides with \nongoing efforts by Member States to formulate a new \nglobal development agenda to succeed the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We shall tirelessly work \nwith the President and the international community \nas we define the post-2015 development agenda. The \npriorities that the President has laid out for this session \nof the Assembly, that is, the issues of climate change, \npoverty eradication, the empowerment of women and \ngender equality, the rule of law and international peace \nand security, are among the most critical and central to \nthe success and sustainability of a global development \nagenda.\n\nAs we draw the curtain on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, it is important that we reflect on \nour successes and failures in order to draw vital lessons \nfrom our experience. The global community, most \nnotably in the developing world, has faced significant \nchallenges in fully realizing the MDGs. That has \nresulted in many of our countries failing to deliver \ntangible development achievements to their citizens, as \ncogently set out in the MDGs, despite their best efforts \nand intentions. We continue to witness intolerable \nlevels of poverty, disease, economic stagnation and \nenvironmental degradation, as well as other drawbacks, \nprecipitated in large part by natural disasters and severe \nresource and capacity constraints.\n\nWhile Botswana has made impressive gains in the \nimplementation of the MDGs, it has not been without \nenormous challenges, chief among which were resource \nand capacity constraints. The Botswana Government has \nstrived to achieve the MDGs and improve the quality of \n\nlife of its citizens by allocating a substantial percentage \nof the national budget to the sectors with significant \nbearing on the country\u2019s development, including \neducation, health, infrastructure, the development of \nhuman capital, and women and youth empowerment. \nBotswana continues to make every effort, in the \nremaining time before the target 2015 completion date, \nto finish the unfinished business remaining from the \nMDGs, especially Goals 4 and 5, relating to infant and \nmaternal mortality.\n\nThe outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease, \nevolving, as it did, into a public health catastrophe, is \na serious setback to the achievement of the MDGs. We \ntherefore implore the Assembly to call on all partners \nand organizations of goodwill to spare no effort in \nrescuing the West African region from that scourge.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment of 2012 mapped a clear and strategic path \nfor the achievement of global sustainable development, \ncalling for an inclusive and transformative agenda that \nintegrates the three pillars of sustainable development, \nnamely, economic, social and environmental protection.\n\nBotswana has keenly followed the work of the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals, which has had as its primary objective the \nformulation of a single, transformative and global \ndevelopment agenda, as mandated by the Rio+20 \noutcome document. We are highly encouraged by \nthe spirit of consultation and the collective will and \ncommitment of the international community to craft an \nambitious yet inclusive, measurable and sustainable set \nof goals, which should inspire and challenge us all to \nexcel in our quest for the attainment of the future we \nwant. I commend the co-Chairs of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals for their \nexceptional performance in driving the negotiation \nprocess to its logical conclusion. We look forward to \nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the broader post-\n2015 development framework, which will begin during \nthis session of the General Assembly. I assure the \nAssembly of our fullest cooperation and constructive \nengagement in those deliberations.\n\nMy delegation will actively participate in all \ndeliberations on the key development priorities outlined \nby the Secretary-General, in particular the elaboration \nof the post-2015 development agenda. However, there \nare issues of major strategic importance to Botswana. \nThey include climate change, landlocked developing \ncountries, middle-income countries, countries in \nspecial situations and issues of peace and security and \nthe advancement of human rights.\n\nOn climate change, Botswana knows only too well \nthe devastating effects of that phenomenon, which \ncontinues to cause extreme temperatures, changes in the \npatterns of rainfall, land degradation, desertification \nand persistent droughts. In that regard, we believe \nthat addressing those problems should be a primary \nconsideration in the current deliberations on the post-\n2015 sustainable development agenda. We therefore \nlook forward to the twentieth Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, to be held in Lima this year, which \nis supposed to lay the foundation for a legally binding \nagreement for adoption at the next Conference of the \nParties in Paris. We commend the Secretary-General \nfor his initiative in convening the recently concluded \nClimate Change Summit, which successfully injected \nmuch-needed political momentum into the process as \nwe move towards 2015.\n\nAs a middle-income, landlocked developing \ncountry with particular vulnerabilities, we also strongly \nhope for a comprehensive account of those issues in \nthe post-2015 development agenda. We welcome the \n10-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action, \nto be held in November in Vienna, which will broadly \nconsider effective mechanisms for addressing the \nvulnerabilities of landlocked developing countries. We \nhope that, during the review, special attention will also \nbe given to countries with ever-increasing elephant \npopulations, whose numbers not only give rise to \nserious animal-human conflict, but also devastate the \nvery environment that the elephants depend on for their \nsurvival. Botswana has the largest elephant population \nin Africa.\n\nOn issues of social development, I am delighted to \ninform the Assembly that Botswana is making steady \nprogress in eradicating abject poverty, as a result of \nthe implementation of the national poverty eradication \nstrategy that was launched in 2010. Furthermore, we \nhave been able to achieve universal primary education \nand access to HIV/AIDS treatment, care and support \nservices. However, challenges remain on the issues of \nmaintaining quality in education and general services.\n\nFinancial support, technology transfer and \ncapacity-building must invariably be factored into the \npost-2015 development agenda discussions. Failing \n\nthat, our efforts towards poverty eradication and \nsustainable development will be rendered futile. We \nkeenly await the adoption of the new development \nagenda, which will, we trust, support our individual \nand collective efforts to deliver our shared aspirations \nof a safe, secure and prosperous world for both present \nand future generations.\n\nThreats to international peace and security \ncontinue to be among the greatest challenges to human \ndevelopment. Botswana is gravely concerned about the \nincreasing trend of instability, insecurity and violent \nconflict in various parts of the world. We are currently \nwitnessing unimaginable levels of human suffering, \nwith thousands of innocent lives being lost and the \nworld hurtling precipitously towards calamitous levels \nof humanitarian crises.\n\nThe Palestine/Israel conflict and the protracted \nbrutal war in Syria defy human imagination. In Africa, \nthe frequent eruption of violent conflicts in certain \nparts of our continent, now particularly in South Sudan \nand the Central African Republic, are distressing. \nRegrettably, Iraq is also under siege by the Islamic \nState in Iraq and the Levant and the Nusra Front. \nThose terrorist groups threaten not only the stability \nand security of the Middle East, but the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security at large.\n\nNot only are we failing as nation States to exercise \nour duty and responsibility to protect populations from \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity, we in effect \ninadvertently acquiesce in the annihilation of future \ngenerations. Last June, Botswana and the Netherlands \nco-hosted the fourth meeting of the Global Network \nof Focal Points on the Responsibility to Protect, in an \neffort to further consolidate that fundamental principle, \nwhich promotes our individual and collective sense of \nresponsibility towards our citizens.\n\nWhile such efforts may be effective in terms of \nawareness-raising, swift and decisive action remains the \ndomain of the Security Council. It is therefore incumbent \nupon members of the Security Council to demonstrate \nexemplary leadership and a genuine regard for their \nCharter responsibilities to maintain international peace \nand security, as mandated by Article 24 of the Charter. \nBotswana is deeply disappointed and concerned that \nsome permanent members of the Security Council \nconsistently thwart any efforts to find lasting solutions \nto conflict situations. Surely, responsible members of \nthe international community would not, and should \nnot, abdicate their solemn responsibility and allow \nthe Council to be seemingly impelled into a state of \ngrim paralysis as the world burns towards extinction. \nJust this past May, the Council failed to adopt a draft \nresolution seeking to refer the situation in Syria to the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). Needless to say, \nthat was nothing short of a travesty of international \ncriminal justice.\n\nBotswana\u2019s commitment to an effective international \ncriminal justice system remains steadfast. To that \nend, we continue to support the independence and \ncredibility of the ICC as the only existing international \njudicial mechanism available for the investigation and \nprosecution of genocide, war crimes, crimes against \nhumanity and the crime of aggression. However, the \nrole of the Security Council in facilitating the work of \nthe ICC cannot be over-emphasized. It is our sincere \nhope that, going forward, reason and basic human \ncompassion will prevail in Council decisions aimed \nat eliminating threats to international peace and \nsecurity and at fostering a global culture of judicial \naccountability, inclusive governance, the rule of law \nand respect for human rights. In that regard, Botswana \nwelcomes the French initiative regarding voluntary \nrestraint on the use of the veto by the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council in situations of mass \natrocities.\n\nBotswana also commends those countries, human \nrights defenders and humanitarian organizations that \nhave valiantly contributed to efforts to relieve human \nsuffering wherever it occurred around the world. We \nespecially applaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor his unwavering commitment to the pursuit of \ninternational peace and security, including addressing \nthe plight of vulnerable groups in society, such as \nwomen and children.\n\nLet me conclude by reiterating and reaffirming \nBotswana\u2019s commitment to the principles and ideals \nof the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter. We \nremain steadfast and resolute in our obligation as a \nmember of the international community to contribute, \nin our own small way, to the creation of a peaceful, \nsecure and prosperous world for all.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to thank and congratulate Mr. John Ashe of \nAntigua and Barbuda, who during his time as President \nlaid the foundation and established the conditions \nfor formulating a new development agenda geared \nto influencing the sustainable development of the \nmembers of the General Assembly.\n\nI would also like to congratulate the new President \non his election to the presidency of the Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. His tenure comes at a time \nwhen the global family is facing very serious threats \nfrom the Ebola virus and from what I call the terrorist \nvirus, threats that demand that we all marshal our \nhuman, financial and other resources in a global \npartnership aimed at combating these modern plagues. \nThe President\u2019s tenure also comes as we are about to \ncommence the second phase of our formulation of the \npost-2015 development agenda. I am confident, as I am \nsure we all are, that he will administer and lead with \ndistinction.\n\nToday it is a privilege for me to share with the \nAssembly the perspectives of the Government of \nTrinidad and Tobago on our priorities for delivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, according to the President\u2019s \n\naptly selected theme. Last year we considered how \nwe would set the stage for the process to be launched \nduring this sixty-ninth session on finalizing the post-\n2015 development agenda. I noted then that when we \nadopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \nand introduced the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), a new chapter opened for the United Nations \n(see A/68/PV.10). That chapter would see the United \nNations positioned as a vehicle for assisting developing \ncountries, especially the most vulnerable, in their \nefforts to reduce poverty and hunger, and for providing \nan environment that would enable States to develop \ntheir economies and thus help their people rise out of \npersistent poverty.\n\nMeasures must now be put in place to spur a \nproactive rather than reactive approach to the issue of \ndevelopment in this transformative post-2015 agenda. \nWith the experience of the challenges and lessons \nencountered in the past 14 years in the implementation \nof the MDGs, we are now at a critical juncture in \nputting into operation the elements we agreed to at \nthe 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20) so that they will constitute the \nfuture we want. The current model was built on what \nwe agreed to at the Millennium Summit, but in some \nways it has fallen short of the expectations of many \ndeveloping countries.\n\nHowever, the Government and people of Trinidad \nand Tobago have been able to achieve this objective \nbecause it formed an integral part of our 2011 medium-\nterm policy framework, through which we incorporated \nand aligned the MDGs and their targets with Trinidad \nand Tobago\u2019s medium-term national priorities. \nConsequently, some of the goals, targets and indicators \nwere modified in the light of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s \nunique development circumstances and its achievement \nof several of the MDGs. That approach resulted in, \nfor example, modified targets for education, including \nachieving universal early-childhood education and a \n60 per cent participation rate in tertiary education.\n\nHowever, I am delighted to say that we have \nsurpassed many of our own targets, as well as some \nof the MDGs. So in Trinidad and Tobago we now \nhave universal free primary- and secondary-school \neducation, and, as I said, we have surpassed our target \nof 60 per cent in the tertiary sector and have 65 per \ncent participation. That too is free. I am also pleased \nto underscore that my country is well poised to achieve \n70 per cent of the 43 targets across the eight goals that \nare considered relevant to the national context. That \npercentage consists of 42 per cent of targets that have \nalready been met and 28 per cent that are likely to be \nmet by 2015. So we say that with good success, and \nlessons learned, we know what we still have to work on.\n\nI now turn to a short discussion of the Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM). Trinidad and Tobago, as part \nof the CARICOM region and the global community, \nwelcomes the outcomes of the various milestones in \nthe process we have achieved to date. As a member of \nCARICOM, we have been an active participant in the \nOpen Working Group on the Sustainable Development \nGoals. We have therefore been witness to the sweeping \nand unprecedented global participation and interest in \nthat process and its outcome. As a collective effort, \nthe crafting of the sustainable development goals \nundoubtedly captured a spirit of openness, inclusiveness \nand partnership, all of which underpin this new phase \nof policy design and implementation. Along with the \nreport of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts \non Sustainable Development Financing (A/69/315), the \n17 goals adopted in July form a solid foundation.\n\nIt is my respectful view that in delivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda we must and should prioritize key issues for this \nsession of the General Assembly. I have identified four \nsuch priorities. The first, I believe, is for us to renew \nour commitment to achieving the MDGs. Even in the \none year we have left, with more dedicated effort we \ncan make further advances on our original objectives. \nAs the MDG Gap Task Force Report, 2014: The State \nof the Global Partnership for Development highlights, \nalthough progress has been made in some areas, the \ngains must be accelerated and in some areas a renewed \neffort is needed to close the glaring gaps that still exist. \nSome of those gaps are in important areas such as \naccess to affordable essential medicines, and in long-\nterm debt sustainability, particularly for small States, \nwhich is an essential element of the global partnership \nfor sustainable development. Implementation will be a \nkey measure of our commitment to the aspirations for \nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nThe second priority is operationalizing \u201cThe \nfuture we want\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex). In the \nRio+20 Conference in 2012, we agreed on many of \nthe foundation elements for the post-2015 development \nagenda. Coming out of that, we now have several \nkey documents to further inform and guide us on \nthe way forward. We have, for example, the report of \n\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Global \nSustainability (A/66/700); the sustainable development \ngoals; the report of the Intergovernmental Committee \nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing; the \noutcomes of the structured dialogues on a technology \nfacilitation mechanism (see resolution 68/310), and \nthe 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable \nconsumption and production.\n\n\u201cThe future we want\u201d also outlines some key \nemerging challenges that we need to urgently address in \nthe context of the post-2015 development agenda. Some \nof those issues, as the Assembly will recall, include \nnon-communicable diseases, the increasing urgency \nto address climate change, and the imperative of \naddressing the needs of marginalized groups, including \nwomen, youth, children and persons living with \ndisabilities. Those are the building blocks of the future \nwe want to form the basis of the post-2015 development \nagenda. Together with the institutional support of the \nhigh-level political forum on sustainable development, \nthe reformed Economic and Social Council and the \nUnited Nations Environmental Assembly, we have a \nsolid foundation for fashioning a global partnership \nin support of poverty eradication through sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General\u2019s \nsynthesized report, which should place all of those \nelements in the context of a fully integrated post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda and give due consideration to the \nneeds of countries in special situations, including small \nisland developing States, least developed countries, \nlandlocked developing countries and Africa. As a \nspecialized conference mandated in \u201cThe future \nwe want\u201d, the outcome document (A/CONF.223/3, \nannex) of the recently concluded Third International \nConference on Small Island Developing States \u2014 the \nSmall Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities \nof Action \u2014 should also be appropriately addressed in \nthe upcoming Secretary-General\u2019s report.\n\nThe third priority is for us to revitalize the global \npartnership in support of sustainable development. The \n8 August 2014 draft report of the Intergovernmental \nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \nFinancing has highlighted that current financing \nand investment patterns will not deliver sustainable \ndevelopment. In fact, it goes on to say that\n\n\u201c[w]hile design and implementation of policies \nwill be on the national level, achieving sustainable \ndevelopment will require international support and \ncooperation\u201d.\nThose are the core prerequisites for a global partnership \nin support of sustainable development. However, in \norder make such a partnership meaningful, it is my \nrespectful view that it must also include the following \nfour particular elements.\nFirst, it must include reform in the international \nfinancial institutions, targeting on systemic failures \nand focusing on building resilience that can sustain \ngrowth in open and vulnerable economies.\n\nSecondly, it must include the successful completion \nof the Doha Round of trade negotiations, which will \nensure that the rules of trade and commerce do not \ncontinue to operate so as to slow, impede or negate \ndevelopment gains and aspirations in our very small \nand vulnerable economies. I note that the third \nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \nis scheduled to take place in July 2015. That will be \ncritically important to ensuring that a meaningful \nand effective global partnership for development will \nbecome a reality for the implementation of the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nThirdly, on the point of a revitalized global \npartnership in support of sustainable development, I \nwish to strongly reiterate the support of Trinidad and \nTobago for an end to the economic embargo against \nCuba. The perpetuation of those measures against \na developing country undermines our collective \naspirations for a post-2015 development agenda in \nwhich no one should be left behind.\n\nFourthly, our priority should be for us to address \nthe mitigation gap for achieving the target of below \n2 or 1.5\u02daC target for limiting the increase in global \ngreenhouse gas emissions and achieving an ambitious, \nlegally binding agreement on climate change in 2015 \nto be applied from 2020. That agreement should set \nthe world on track to achieving carbon neutrality by \n2070, and by so doing ensure that the global climate \nwill support the sustainable development of present as \nwell as future generations.\n\nOur collective action on climate change should \ntake into account the survival of the most vulnerable \nStates in particular, such as our small island developing \nStates, as the front line of increasingly severe impacts \nof climate change. It should also be firmly rooted in the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities, \n\n\nrecognizing that developing countries\u2019 finance needs \nfor mitigation and adaptation to climate change cannot \nbe met exclusively from domestic resources, given the \ncompeting demands on public finance. I believe that \nevery Head of Government and every Head of State \nwould recognize those competing interests in their own \nnation States.\n\nIt is therefore essential to put the Green Climate \nFund into force early. It is my hope that the partnerships \nand announcements made at the United Nations Climate \nSummit 2014 on Tuesday, 23 September, will serve to \ncatalyse more ambitious action on climate change in the \nnear as well as in the long-term and build the momentum \nnecessary for a successful Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in Lima in December and in Paris \nin 2015.\n\nThose are the elements of the global framework, \nwhich should occupy our full attention and commitment \nover the course of the sixty-ninth session of the General \nAssembly. Those elements will be supported by critical \nenabling actions at the regional and national levels. \nFor us in the context of the Caribbean Community, we \nhave been doing our part as a subregion of small island \nand low-lying developing States to foster regional \nintegration in support of the sustainable development \nof all of our peoples. CARICOM Heads of State and \nGovernment have agreed on the vision of\n\n\u201ca Caribbean community that is integrated, inclusive \nand resilient; driven by knowledge, excellence, \ninnovation and productivity; a community where \nevery citizen is secure and has the opportunity \nto realize his or her potential with guaranteed \nhuman rights and social justice; and contributes \nto and shares in, its economic, social and cultural \nprosperity. A community which can be a unified \nand competitive force in the global arena\u201d.\nThat vision is the collective ambition of the States \nmembers of CARICOM, agreed in the context of a \nstrategic framework plan for period 2015-2019. That \nplan will come through the implementation of six \nintegrated strategic priorities, which include building \neconomic, social, environmental and technological \nresilience through a coordinated foreign policy and \nresearch and development innovation.\n\nIn support of the implementation of those six \npriorities, CARICOM Heads of State and Government \nhave called for a post-2015 development agenda that \nwill work in tandem with what we are discussing at \nthe sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly and \nneeds to focus on the eradication of poverty as a central \npillar, the adoption of a people-centred approach \nthrough an intergovernmentally agreed agenda, and \nan agenda that incorporates broader measures and \nappropriate approaches and criteria to complement \nthe gross domestic product per capita as a measure \nof development. Importantly, those broader measures \nmust foster an enabling global policy environment that \nis more conducive to the achievement of development \nobjectives and affords greater policy coherence across \ninstitutions, including those in the areas of trade, \nfinance, environment and development.\n\nThose regional initiatives in support of advancing \nthe sustainable development of the people of CARICOM \nare being designed and implemented in the context \nof a broader strategy for mitigating the vulnerability \ninherent in countries as small and open as ours, In \nthe context of a limited and narrow resource base, \nthe focus is on nurturing and developing our human \nresources through an emphasis on innovation and \nentrepreneurship. It is an approach that focuses on the \nfull realization of the human rights to development and \na life of dignity.\n\nConsistent with this approach, I turn to another \nmatter close to our hearts in the region as we continue \nto advance the global cause of truth, justice and \nreconciliation, within the context of reparatory justice \nfor the victims and the descendants of the trans-Atlantic \nslave trade. As a region we are determined to engage \nin reparatory dialogue with the former slave-owning \nEuropean nations in order to address the living legacies \nof these crimes. This is a critically vital element of the \nsocioeconomic development aspirations of the region as \nthe victims of these crimes and their descendants were \nleft in a state of social, psychological, economic and \ncultural deprivation. In addition, they have been left \nin a state of disenfranchisement that has ensured their \nsuffering and debilitation to this day, and from which \nonly reparatory action can alleviate their suffering.\n\nI hold that sustainable development cannot be \nachieved in an environment where people are denied \ntheir basic rights to live free from fear, with daily \ndeprivation of the necessities of life due to the ravages \nof war and other types of instability. It is for these \nreasons that Trinidad and Tobago is concerned by the \ndevelopments in Ukraine and other parts of the globe, \nwhich have caused pain and suffering to hundreds of \n\ninnocent victims. They too must be allowed to live \nfreely.\n\nAt the same time, we note with grave concern \nthe continued failure to find a lasting solution to the \ndecades-old Arab-Israeli conflict, which has caused \ntremendous loss of life and destruction of property in \nthe Gaza Strip, and has left emotional and psychological \nscars on those almost 2,000 families who lost loved \nones. Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to the \nnegotiation of the two-State solution as the preferred \nmeans to bring lasting peace to the region so that the \npeople of Palestine, so long denied their rightful place in \nthe international community, can live in larger freedom \nwith their Israeli brothers and sisters. To that end, we \ncall for the implementation of all relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions geared towards the resolution of the \nconflict and the lifting of the illegal embargo imposed \non the Palestinian people since 2005.\n\nLikewise, as co-sponsors of Security Council \nresolution 2178 (2014), on threats to international \npeace and security caused by terrorists acts, adopted \nat Wednesday\u2019s summit, we remain optimistic that \nthe resolution may serve as a catalyst for greater \ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\n\nWe in Trinidad and Tobago have been the victim of \nterrorists in 1990, when there was an attempted coup \nagainst the newly elected Government by terrorists and \nextremists. Members will agree that this new terrorist \nphenomenon could be dubbed a terrorism \u201cvirus\u201d as it is \nspreading throughout the global family. The Assembly \nwill agree that terrorism has been undermining, and \ncontinues to undermine, the sovereignty, territorial \nintegrity and peace and security of the peoples of the \nMiddle East and further afield.\n\nMembers of the Assembly will also recall that, in \nmy inaugural address to this body in September 2010 \n(see A/65/PV.20), I indicated that the time was right \nfor the adoption of a treaty to regulate the international \ntrade in conventional arms. That has now come to be \nhistory with the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty \n(ATT); after yesterday\u2019s High-level Treaty Event, it \nnow has the requisite number of States parties for its \nentry into force, which is likely to be on 25 December \nof this year. We are very happy about that.\n\nThe entry into force of the ATT will require States \nparties to make important decisions to implement \nthe provisions of the Treaty at the First Conference \nof States Parties, which is likely to be convened by \nmid-2015. One of these decisions is on the location \nof the ATT secretariat. Over a year ago, my country \nannounced its candidature to have the ATT secretariat \nlocated in Port of Spain. That bid has been endorsed \nby all 14 CARICOM States and has so far received the \nsupport from a number of States from diverse regions. \nThe hosting of this important body in a region which \nis disproportionately affected by the illicit trade in \nsmall arms and light weapons and its association with \nother trans-boundary crimes, such as drug trafficking, \nwould be a significant development. It will assist in the \nfull and effective implementation of the Treaty, and \ncontribute to the reduction, if not the elimination, of \nillegal weapons in the hands of criminals whose actions \ncontinue to threaten the sustainable development of our \nregion.\n\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is \ncommitted to providing the necessary resources to \nhost the secretariat, and this has been transmitted to \nall Members of the United Nations. I call once more \non all those States which have not yet announced their \nsupport for our candidature to do so and to ensure that \nthe principle of equitable geographic distribution in the \nlocation of major global bodies is observed. No country \nor region, in my respectful view, must continue to have \na monopoly in hosting important institutions which are \nestablished for the benefit of all.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago is satisfied that, among the \n17 sustainable development goals adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly on 10 September, goal 3 ensures \nhealthy lives and promotes well-being for all ages. \nThe health and well-being of our people are critical \nto ensuring productive lifestyles which are critical \nto sustainable economic development, growth and \nachieving a transformative past-2015 development \nagenda. Health and well-being are one of the 10 thematic \nareas of development identified by the Government of \nTrinidad and Tobago.\n\nIt will be recalled that CARICOM, of which we \nare a member, was largely responsible for calling \nthe attention of the General Assembly to the need \nto adopt a resolution to focus attention of the effects \nof non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as a major \ncontributor to human mortality. Nevertheless, while \nwe continue to make strides in tackling the incidence \nof NCDs, we are cognizant of the need to combat the \nspread of infectious diseases within our region and in \ndifferent regions, which threaten the survival of people \nin many nations.\n\n\nSecurity Council resolution 2177 (2014), which \nwas co-sponsored by Trinidad and Tobago, garnered \nunanimous support, including that of the Secretary-\nGeneral, for dealing with the Ebola virus. We \ncongratulate the Secretary-General. Members pledged \nto take action at the global and regional levels to combat \nthe spread of Ebola to supplement the United Nations \nMission for Ebola Emergency Response. Trinidad \nand Tobago remains committed to playing our part in \neradicating infectious diseases undermining the health \nand well-being of our people.\n\nIt is for this reason that, prior to the adoption of \nresolution 2177 (2014), on Ebola, as Prime Minister of \nTrinidad and Tobago I wrote to the Secretary-General \nof CARICOM requesting that a meeting of States \nmembers of the Community be convened to discuss and \nagree on sustainable policy responses at the national \nand regional levels alike concerning public health \nissues, including Chikungunya and the Ebola virus.\n\nFinally, the Assembly can rest assured of the support \nof the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in assisting \nthe United Nations family in shaping a transformative \npost-2015 development agenda. Our support will come \nnot only through our representation in the various organs \nof this global institution but also by continuing to adopt \npolicies at the national level geared towards putting \npeople at the centre of all developmental objectives. \nI say once again: any development agenda which \nalienates people or places them at the periphery and not \nthe centre will not bring sustainable development and \nwill be doomed to failure. Such failure stands against \nthe commitment we have all made and the purposes we \nare serving at the Assembly. Our work is cut out \u2014 for \nall of us, together in global partnership, to achieve the \ngoals that we have set ourselves."

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nallow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa of \nthe Republic of Uganda on his election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I have \nfull confidence that, under his guidance, the sixty-ninth \nsession will proceed to a successful conclusion. I would \nalso like to take the opportunity to extend my great \nappreciation to Mr. John William Ashe of Antigua and \nBarbuda for his wise leadership and relentless efforts \nas President of the sixty-eighth session in guiding us to \nmany outstanding achievements.\n\nIn many ways, the world in which we are living \nis at a critical juncture, and the current picture is \nrather bleak. The international community remains \nseriously concerned over recent geopolitical security \ndevelopments in many parts of the world. The self-\ndeclared Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and its \nhorrendous crimes are menacing peace, security and \nstability in those countries, which have already been \nseriously hit by armed conflicts and acts of violence. \nIn Syria, the continued armed hostilities have not only \ncaused the deaths of thousands of innocent people and \nchildren, but have also led to millions of refugees. \nIn Africa, some countries have also suffered armed \nconflicts and violence, which have placed peace and \nstability at risk in that part of the world. All those armed \nconflicts and crimes are threatening peace, stability \nand human security, not only in those regions, but also \nin the world at large.\n\nTo contribute to the peace process in the Middle \nEast and Africa, Cambodia has participated actively \nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. We have \ndispatched more than 2,000 peacekeepers to Lebanon, \nMali and South Sudan. In November, Cambodia will \ndeploy another detachment of 216 peacekeepers to \nthe United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.\n\nWhile extremism is threatening the world\u2019s peace \nand security, the spread of the Ebola epidemic in Africa \nhas also become one of the worst threats to the world \ntoday. It is of critical importance that the international \ncommunity make concerted efforts to address that \nglobal challenge in an effective and timely manner.\n\nWith regard to the hostilities between Palestine and \nIsrael, despite the fragile ceasefire recently concluded, \nthe situation remains a serious concern. We call on all \nparties to make efforts to resume meaningful peace \ntalks in order to reach a viable political solution of \ntwo States living peacefully side by side. Cambodia \nbelieves that that is the only way to definitively put an \nend to that long-lasting conflict. \n\nThe situation in the eastern part of Europe, in spite \nof the delicate ceasefire, remains worrisome and its \nimplications could presage a return to the Cold War. \n\nIn Asia, the launching of missiles by the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea has aroused international \nconcern and aggravated the situation in the region. The \nSix-Party Talks should be resumed in order to explore \na possible avenue for peaceful dialogue to bring about \na peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nClimate change is currently an obvious global \nchallenge, as well as a human security issue. The rapid \npace of climate change is having devastating effects \nfor both developed and developing countries. The \ndeveloping countries, dependent mostly on agriculture, \n\nsuffer more from the various negative effects of climate \nchange, such as frequent typhoons, storms, floods \nand droughts. For instance, in 2013, heavy monsoon \nrains caused extensive flooding across Cambodia, \nclaimed 168 lives, caused $1 billion in damages and \naffected 1.8 million people. Even this year, 12 out of \nthe 25 provinces and various cities of Cambodia have \nsuffered on account of floods, killing 45 people and \nafflicting almost 100,000 families.\n\nAccording to a report by the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, the global warming caused \nby the increase in greenhouse gases is generated by \nhumankind\u2019s use of fossil fuels. There is no doubt \nthat the industrialized countries, which consume most \nof the world\u2019s fossil fuels, emit the largest amount of \ngreenhouse gas, while the developing countries, which \nproduce only small amounts of such gases, are the main \nvictims of climate change. It is therefore imperative \nthat the international community provide further \nimpetus to revitalize and prioritize actions to address \nclimate change based on the United Nations principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. \n\nWith that concept in mind and while applauding the \nfruitful outcome of the recent United Nations Climate \nSummit, held on 23 September in New York, Cambodia \nhopes that the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in Paris in December 2015, will \nbring about concrete measures to reach a new global \nagreement with legal force applicable to all parties \nunder the Framework Convention.\n\nIn line with the United Nations principles for \nsustainable development and in order to mitigate \nthe threat of climate change, Cambodia has adopted \nits national strategic plan on green development for \n2013-2030, which aims at achieving economic and \nsocial development in a sustainable manner, while at \nthe same time protecting the environment, through the \nefficient use of raw materials and natural resources, \nclean development and green preservation. Cambodia \nhas also adopted several legal instruments for green \ngrowth development, including the memorandum of \nunderstanding on green growth cooperation between \nCambodia and South Korea\u2019s Global Green Growth \nInstitute and the National Council on Green Growth.\n\nSouth-East Asia, which is highly vulnerable to \nthe adverse impacts of climate change, established \nthe Climate Change Initiative of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2009 as a \nconsultative body to further increase the region\u2019s \ncapacity in both mitigation and adaptation efforts. As \na member of ASEAN, Cambodia is fully engaged in \nthe implementation of that ASEAN initiative through \nthe ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change and \nthe ASEAN Action Plan on Joint Response to Climate \nChange, with the goal of enhancing closer and deeper \nregional and international cooperation on climate \nchange.\n\nNext year marks the deadline of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While some MDG targets \nhave been achieved, we have to acknowledge that much \nmore effort is need to reach the set goals of the MDGs, \nas progress has been uneven and insufficient. Many \ndeveloping countries have not attained their MDG \ntargets, primarily owing to unfulfilled commitments, \nlack of resources, insufficient dedication, and food \ninsecurity. The situation was further aggravated by the \nfinancial uncertainty in the developed countries, which \nhas had an impact on their commitment to official \ndevelopment assistance. Therefore, bolder and more \nfocused global efforts are needed as we approach the \nfinal year to realize the MDGs.\n\nWith the aim of realizing the MDGs, Cambodia \nhas adopted its own development targets, known as \nthe Cambodia MDGs, which have been incorporated \ncomprehensively into our National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2014-2018. As a result, substantial \nprogress has been achieved, positioning Cambodia \nto meet some goals of the MDGs by the end of 2015. \nCambodia\u2019s target in reducing the poverty rate to \n19.5 per cent by 2015 has already been achieved ahead \nof schedule, as the nation\u2019s poverty rate had already \nfallen to 19 per cent in 2013. As a result, Cambodia \nreceived a United Nations Award for cutting hunger in \nhalf before the deadline.\n\nIn combating HIV/AIDS, Cambodia has made great \nstrides by progressively reducing HIV prevalence to \n0.6 per cent in 2013. In order to achieve that indicator, the \nCambodian Government has further adopted a getting-\nto-zero policy, aiming to realize zero new infections, \nzero AIDS-related deaths and zero discrimination by \n2020.\n\nIn addition to tracking the Cambodia MDGs \nachievements, the Royal Government of Cambodia has \nput forth a Cambodia MDGs acceleration framework \nwith an approach aimed at accelerating progress in \nachieving the MDGs and other human development \ngoals. The framework could provide the essential \n\n\ninput for the implementation of our National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2014-2018 aimed at completing the \nremaining MDGs, as well as at setting the stage for the \npreparation of the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nCambodia shares the view expressed in the \nreport of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on \nthe Post-2015 Development Agenda, entitled A New \nGlobal Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform \nEconomies through Sustainable Development, to be \nadopted during the sixty-ninth session of the General \nAssembly, that\n\n\u201ca new development agenda should carry forward \nthe spirit of the Millennium Declaration and the \nbest of the MDGs, with a practical focus on things \nlike poverty, hunger, water, sanitation, education \nand health care\u201d.\nCambodia is of the view that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should be realistic and built \nupon the lessons learned from the difficulties in \nthe realization of the MDGs; in particular, it should \nensure that any process towards a broader development \nobjective is truly balanced and comprehensive.\n\nNext year, 2015, is a crucial year as the United \nNations celebrates the seventieth anniversary of its \ncreation and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World \nSummit, where world leaders agreed to reform the \nUnited Nations to meet the needs of today\u2019s geopolitical \nand global challenges (resolution 60/1). To that end, \nthe General Assembly should be further empowered \nso that it can play a leading role in strengthening the \nwider United Nations system. The Security Council, as \na body mandated with the primary responsibility for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \nshould represent the world\u2019s realities today. In sum, we \nthink that more equitable representation in the United \nNations organs would assist the Organization in coping \nwith the urgent global challenges.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to extend warm \ngreetings to the President of the General Assembly \nupon the assumption of his duties at the sixty-ninth \nsession. I also recognize the exemplary stewardship of \nMr. John Ashe, the outgoing President, and record our \nappreciation of the Secretary-General\u2019s stewardship of \nthe Organization during these difficult times.\n\nWhat defines the great communities of our times \nis their ability to overcome the unexpected and to \npersevere and adapt to changing realities \u2014 from the \ndaunting effects of climate change and the ever-pressing \nchallenges of poverty and want to the uncontrollable \nspread of disease. Communities everywhere are striving \nto overcome such obstacles. When communities are \nsubject to challenges that are impossible to bear, they \nthink beyond the realm of possibilities and begin \nseeking different answers to the same questions. That \nis when they nurture their ability to bounce back \nfrom adversity, shock and threats. The ultimate goal \nof fostering resilience is to overcome the unexpected. \nSustainability is about managing, but resilience is \nabout thriving.\n\nFor the past eight decades, the Maldives has been \non a journey to consolidate democracy. Last year, \nour democracy faced unprecedented challenges. Yet \nwe were able to overcome those hurdles entirely by \npeaceful means. Even though it sometimes felt as if \nwe were quite alone in this fight, we are proud of what \nwe have achieved. We take pride in the fact that our \ndemocracy is home-grown. Our systems are organic. \nOur young institutions, as in the older democracies \nof the world, are gradually settling into patterns and \ntraditions that are unique to our string of islands and in \nharmony with our Islamic heritage and our traditions.\n\nOur experience clearly shows that holding elections \nor introducing a multiparty political system does not \ninstil democratic values in a society. Democracy \ncannot be traced in the pages of laws. The only way \nfor a new home-grown democracy to achieve resilience \nis to shift the way its people think. A transformation \nin their normative framework is necessary. Democratic \nvalues need to find a place in the hearts and minds \nof the people. The Government of President Abdulla \nYameen Abdul Gayoom and the people of the Maldives \nare determined to achieve a modern and authentic \nMaldivian democratic State.\n\nPromoting and protecting human rights is central \nto Maldivian democracy. Our Constitution is very \nclear on what those rights entail. Yet with every right \ncome responsibilities. It has been a daunting challenge \nto make human rights a way of life. That is why the \nMaldives advocates cultivating a culture of respect for \nhuman rights. Policies need to be rights-based. People \nneed to be rights-minded.\n\nPeople must lie at the heart of every decision we \nmake and every policy we adopt. The ultimate goal of \nevery action must be to improve the lives of our people. \nThe Government of President Yameen has embarked \non an ambitious programme aimed at realizing the \nfull potential of our young people. The goal of the \nGovernment is to create opportunities that would help \nto unleash their creativity. Young people are the future \n\n\nof any country, and, without the full realization of their \nproductive capabilities, countries cannot prosper.\n\nA few days ago, the United Nations marked an \nimportant milestone: the twentieth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Programme of Action of the International \nConference on Population and Development. Today, we \ncelebrate the achievement of many of the goals of that \nProgramme \u2014 most notably, low maternal and infant \nmortality rates, gender parity in school enrolment and \nequal pay for equal work.\n\nNext year, we will celebrate the twentieth \nanniversary of the adoption of another important \ndocument, the Beijing Platform for Action. It is a fact, \nnot mere speculation, that for building resilience and \nbuilding sustainable societies, women\u2019s contributions \nare a necessity. Women have achieved remarkable \nprogress since the Beijing Platform. Maldivian women \nare among the most emancipated in South Asia, with \nno structural barriers to education, employment or \nmobility. Still, much remains to be achieved. Just as \nan example, I ask the Assembly to think back over \nthe past week of general debate. How many women \nspoke at this rostrum? How many countries can claim \nto have achieved parity between men and women \nat decision-making levels? In the Maldives, we are \ncommitted to empowering women and have adopted a \nzero-tolerance policy towards violence against women.\n\nThe resilience of our people in overcoming adversity \nin their lives is rooted in their ability to rise up from \nthe fear of want and the fear of need. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were framed to do just \nthat. The MDGs committed to a new partnership to \nreduce extreme poverty, halt the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand provide primary education for all. The MDGs set \nbenchmarks and gave targets to Governments. Those \ntargets enabled them to plan effectively. The MDGs, \nthough remarkable for their time, were limited and are \nnow reaching their expiry date. We ardently believe that \nthe post-2015 development agenda must be inclusive, \ntransparent and people-centred. The new development \nagenda should succeed where the MDGs failed.\n\nAt times, the violence, bloodshed, conflict and \nupheaval that we witness on a daily basis seem \nunbearable. In July 2014, we watched with grief the \nhorrendous attack on the Gaza Strip \u2014 another in a \ncountless cycle of aggression and brutality. Our hearts \nbleed for the countless children who lost their lives, the \nmothers who lost their children, the nation and the State \nof Palestine, which lost countless citizens. After the \nglobal outcry and the outpouring of condemnation, the \nguns have stopped firing and the bombs have stopped \ndropping. The world seems to have moved on to the next \ncrisis. The news cycles have found their next headline.\n\nYet, we recall here again, the siege is not over. The \nblockade has not ended. Gaza has been destroyed and \nits development set back several years. Palestinians are \nstill being denied their right to a sovereign nation of \ntheir own, to their own lands and to the fruits of their \nlabour. Palestinian children are being denied a right to \ndetermine their own destiny. Are we willing to let that \ncontinue? We must do more to help realize the dream \nof peace in the Middle East and a two-State solution. \nWe must resume peace talks with a clear goal and an \nendpoint in mind.\n\nThe biggest challenge to our development and our \nway of life is ignorance, violence, subjugation and \nperpetual poverty. Misinformed yet talented young \npeople can easily be lured into fanaticism, radicalism \nand extremism. Islam\u2019s identity as a religion that \nsupports innovation, knowledge and scholarship is \nslowly eroding away. The golden era of our religion is \nalmost forgotten.\n\nToday, the world has a choice to make. Should we \nallow extremists to shape our future? Or should we take \ndecisive actions to defeat the extremist ideologies? Our \nanswer to those questions will define the way in which \nwe deal with the so-called Islamic State and other \nterrorist groups. Not only are those groups un-Islamic, \nthey are anti-Islamic. They are terrorist organizations, \nnot religious groups. Islam, our great religion of \npeace, compassion and tolerance, is being hijacked by \nradical and extremist elements to perpetuate hatred \nand violence. We, the Government and the people of \nMaldives, condemn in the strongest terms those groups, \ntheir ideologies and their activities. We join our fellow \nMuslims around the world in saying \u201cnot in my name\u201d.\n\nThe unique challenges faced by small island \ndeveloping States are well known. Climate change \nexacerbates those challenges. We remain hopeful that \na legally binding treaty will be agreed to next year in \nParis. The Maldives stands ready to do all it can to \nmake this hope a reality, for the sake of our children \nand our nation.\n\nEarlier this month, we agreed to a new highway \nfor development, the Small Island Developing States \nAccelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. We commend \nSamoa for its leadership in setting the vision for a new \n\n\ngateway for small States. To make the partnership \nenduring, we need the small island developing States to \nmake their voices heard and to be united in the quest. \nThe Maldives has therefore been inspired to take the \nlead in forming the Alliance of Small Island States for \nthe purpose of facing the challenges of post-2015 and \nbeyond. We call on others to join us in that journey.\n\nNine days ago, on 21 September, we celebrated \n49 years of membership in the United Nations. The \nMaldives joined the United Nations a mere 58 days \nafter independence \u2014 we were the smallest Member \nState at the time. As we look forward to celebrating \n50 years of membership in 2015, the Maldives is happy \nto note that the United Nations has served us well. We \njoined the United Nations in 1965, amid questions over \nthe viability of small States. In the past 49 years, the \nMaldives has taken the lead in showing the world that \nsmall States are not only viable, but in fact valuable in \nfinding common solutions to common problems. Today, \nat the United Nations, we continue to prove that small \nStates can also lead and that it is not size but smart \nideas that make a nation\u2019s destiny.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure to address \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. As the \ncurrent Chairman of the East African Community, I am \nparticularly pleased to see The Honourable Sam Kutesa \npreside over the General Assembly. I assure you, \nMr. President, of the full support of my Government \nduring your presidency.\n\nI would like to begin by lending my voice to all of \nthose who have called for urgent and sustained attention \n\n\nto the devastating Ebola crisis in Liberia, Sierra Leone \nand Guinea. Beyond the tragedy of the thousands who \nhave lost lives and loved ones and the many more \nliving with that threat, livelihoods and businesses have \ncollapsed and aspirations for shared prosperity continue \nto shrink day by day. Kenya stands in solidarity with \nthe countries affected by this devastating virus.\n\nEarlier this month the Kenyan people gave \n$1 million to the effort to bring the crisis under control, \nand we stand ready to do more. Last week, ministers \nof health from the East Africa region converged in \nNairobi and agreed on measures to safeguard our \npopulations and ensure that the virus does not spread \nin our region. The suspension of international flights \ninto Monrovia and other affected capitals, including \nby Kenya Airways, followed a stark warning from the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO). Those measures, \namong others, have isolated the affected countries and \nfurther hurt the people and economies of the region.\n\nWith regard to Kenya, our intention was not to \ndo harm, but the warning from the WHO left us, as \na regional hub, with few options. We stand ready \nto resume Kenya Airways flights once appropriate \nmeasures are put in place. Kenya believes that nothing \nin the immediate future requires more attention and \ndetermined response from the international community \nthan the effort to stop and contain that devastating \nvirus. I therefore welcome the establishment by the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations Mission for \nEbola Emergency Response, which I am sure will guide \na collective global response.\n\nThe Ebola crisis underlines the imperative to build \nstrong States that can withstand crisis and respond to \nemergencies. State weakness in many African countries \ncomes from a history of development paradigms and \npractices that weakened the State. We must commit \nto building strong, resilient and accountable States \nthat can effectively respond to shocks, adversities and \nemergencies in the future.\n\nYou, Sir, are presiding over a session of the General \nAssembly of historic significance to humankind. The \nsixty-ninth session will oversee the development and \nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda. This \neffort will build on the work of the Open Working Group \non Sustainable Development Goals, which developed \nthose goals. Kenya is indeed proud to have been at the \nforefront of driving the Open Working Group process.\n\nThe new world development agenda must address \nitself to the entire cross-section of social, economic \nand environmental challenges that face the world in \nthe twenty-first century. Issues of sustained economic \ndevelopment, equality among nations, climate change, \nindustrialization, biodiversity loss and environmental \nprotection must now go hand in glove with the traditional \nchallenges of poverty, disease, hunger and inequality \nwithin nations. The new agenda must therefore be \nuniversal and comprehensive and responsive to all \nnations equally in order to be transformative in its \nimpact.\n\nWe in Kenya recognize, however, that a number \nof obstacles stand in the way of achieving the new \ndevelopment agenda. The most immediate of these are \nterrorism and violent extremism. In Kenya, we stand \nat a critical moment. As we deepen our democracy, we \nfind our nation thrust onto the front line of a regional \nand global war against terror. We have become acutely \naware that the interplay between democratization, on \nthe one hand, and effective counter-terrorism, on the \nother, presents severe challenges to our security and \nour governance institutions. Increasingly, terrorist \nactors are exploiting the expanded democratic space, \nsometimes feeding into and even influencing local \npolitics. Unless we can provide an effective buffer to \nfight back against that tendency, Kenya and indeed other \ncountries will find it difficult to entrench democracy \nand the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nBesides the immediate threat of terrorism, the state \nof economic and social well-being is also affected by \nthe lack of sustainable peace and security in many \nof our countries. From the Central African Republic \nto Mali, Libya and even as far afield as the Middle \nEast and Europe, we see new conflicts and crises that \ncould derail or delay development. In Kenya, we are \nparticularly concerned by the perennial fragility that \nhas come to characterize the greater Horn of Africa.\n\nIn Somalia, Kenya continues to sacrifice lives \nand resources in an effort to bring peace to our \nneighbour. We do this trusting that the international \ncommunity will stay the course in Somalia. This \ninvolves consolidating peace and investing in stable, \nresponsive national institutions that guarantee public \nsafety, promote democracy and civil liberties, as well \nas development and peace in the country and region.\n\nAs we meet here, South Sudan also remains \nin turmoil. Kenya and other countries of the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \nhave invested considerable effort in ending that tragedy \nand sparing the people of South Sudan further suffering. \n\n\nRegrettably, however, progress has been slow. We \ncannot let that young nation and its people down. At \nthis session of the Assembly, I make a special plea for \nSouth Sudan, for no nation has, over the years, suffered \nas much neglect from the international community.\n\nSimilarly, no country today remains as desperately \nin need of rapid and transformative economic and \nsocial development as South Sudan. We cannot allow \na return to political chaos, economic collapse or social \ndesperation. I implore the leaders of that young nation \nto demonstrate determined and enlightened leadership \nand to make peace without further delay. Such action \nwill save the people of the nation enormous suffering \nand offer hope of a better future. I thank the Security \nCouncil for its continued cooperation with IGAD in the \nsearch for peace in South Sudan. It is this concert of \naction that will help to bring about lasting peace, which \nin turn will form the basis for a transformative post-\n2015 development agenda for South Sudan and all of its \nneighbours.\n\nOn the continent of Africa the development \nmodel of the past 50 years has run its course. That \noutmoded model was defined by negative trade \nrelations, paternalistic global governance regimes \nand overreliance on official development assistance. \nMoreover, it was driven by external prescriptions for \ndevelopment that were heavy on political instruction, \nbut light on economic and social transformation.\n\nWe now know better. We know that our social \nand economic transformation shall come first from \nwithin our nations, our region and our continent, and \nonly secondly from the complement of external ideas \nand resources. Equally important, those external \ncontributions must recognize the primacy of our \naspirations and ideas. They must value and safeguard, \nrather than simply exploit and consume, our domestic \nresources and the product of our people\u2019s labour. For \nthe post-2015 development agenda to be transformative, \ntherefore, it must first embrace the primacy of \ndeveloping countries whose people seek sustained \ndevelopment most. Anything less will be a recipe for \nfailure.\n\nWe cannot speak of development or of \ntransformation when millions of the world\u2019s people \nare mired in and are broken by unrelenting poverty, \ndisease and hunger. The business of ridding the world \nof those plagues, touched upon but not fully embraced \nby the Millennium Development Goals, must be the \nfirst of the aspirations of the post-2015 development \nagenda. Equally important, it must be fully financed \nand accelerated, if we are to lay the groundwork for a \ntransformative agenda for the next generation. I cannot \nemphasize that point enough. The scourge and shame of \ndebilitating poverty, preventable diseases and chronic \nhunger must be erased from our global civilization. In \nreaching the sustainable development goals we have set \nourselves, within a time frame of 15 years, we must not \nfail.\n\nThis year, at the United Nations, Kenya is proud \nto have presided over the Conference of States Parties \nto the Convention on the Rights for Persons with \nDisabilities. Kenya also presided over the United \nNations Forum on Forests and co-chaired the Open \nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals. \nKenya is currently presiding over the UNICEF Board, \nas it seeks to provide global leadership for issues of \nconcern to the world\u2019s children and their well-being.\n\nKenya is a member in good standing of the \ninternational community and it intends to continue to \nshoulder its global and regional responsibilities. Kenya \nis especially proud of the scores of Kenyans who work \nfor the United Nations here in New York, but also further \nafield in peacemaking, peacekeeping, peacebuilding \nand in many United Nations organizations in various \nUnited Nations stations around the world, including \nNairobi. I salute all those Kenyans \u2014 every single one \nof them \u2014 for their dedication and commitment. We in \nKenya believe that no nation is too poor or too rich, too \nbig or too small to play its rightful role in making the \nworld a better place for all.\n\nAt the national level, Kenya grounds her \ntransformative agenda on a strategic vision \u2014 our Vision \n2030. Importantly, in 2010 we adopted a new democratic \nConstitution, which expanded and guaranteed a \nwider range of rights for our people and defined \nnew institutions for the advancement of those rights. \nDrawing on that, we have re-engineered our system \nof governance, making it more democratic, inclusive, \ndevolved and responsive. We have also significantly \nexpanded participation in political and development \ndecision-making.\n\nIn four short years, we have begun to witness the \nfruits of those foundational changes. Aware of the \nimperative to carry along all our people in development, \nmy Government launched targeted interventions for the \nmost vulnerable in society. Those include a number \nof financial initiatives and training programmes \nfor women and youth. We have also prioritized the \n\n\nadvancement of children\u2019s rights and welfare through \ninitiatives that reduce mortality and morbidity. Chief \namong them are universal immunization coverage, the \npromotion of breast-feeding for the first six months \nof a child\u2019s life, the provision of fortified foods and \ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, as well as free care \nfor mothers and children in all government hospitals.\n\nIn that respect, I wish to commend the first Lady \nof Kenya, Ms. Margaret Kenyatta, for successfully \nlaunching the Beyond Zero Campaign that is tapping \ninto private sector financing to bolster the management \nof chronic preventable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, \nand to improve maternal and child health throughout \nthe country.\n\nKenya is today on track to achieve universal \nprimary education. Based on that, we have expanded \nour vision to include universal secondary education. We \nare seeking to build a more inclusive society, and strive \nto leave no one behind. It is for that reason that my \nGovernment has implemented a social protection cash \ntransfer programme to orphans and vulnerable children, \npersons with severe disabilities and our elderly citizens. \nThe programme targets 450,000 households throughout \nKenya. Impact evaluations indicate that the programme \nhas reduced poverty, improved family health and raised \nschool enrolment.\n\nAs the Assembly is aware, Kenya is a leading \ntourist destination. We are also endowed with a number \nof rare species, some endangered, which we hold in \ntrust for humankind. My Government attaches great \nvalue to conservation. We continue to raise awareness \nof the need to step up the fight against poaching and \nillicit wildlife trafficking. We have enacted laws to \nhelp fight the scourge, and continue to work with other \ncountries and organizations to enhance the protection \nof our fauna and flora. Similarly, Kenya remains at the \nheart of international efforts to mitigate and adapt to \nchallenges relating to climate change. We continue to \nwork towards achieving 10-per cent forest cover; we are \nwell above global targets for renewable energy use, and \nfully support all measures agreed upon at the recent \nUnited Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi.\n\nRecognizing that our prosperity is linked to that \nof our neighbours, Kenya is engaged in a range of \nprogrammes and activities to hasten eastern African \nintegration. We have eased the movement of goods \nand services across our borders. More importantly, our \npeople can travel, work and settle across east Africa. \nWe have also grown our trade volumes and are looking \nto closer integration across a range of other sectors.\n\nThose are a few highlights of my Government\u2019s \ntransformative agenda. We are committed to \nsafeguarding and expanding those initiatives by creating \nan enabling and secure environment. In light of that, \nmy Government continues to invest heavily to combat \nextremists and terrorists. The global effort needs to be \nreinforced because, as we know, the intent of terrorists \nis to destroy free, secure and democratic nations and \npeople. As long as international terrorism exploits our \nopen, multicultural and multi-religious society and \ngravely harms our social fabric, our progress towards \nachieving the goals of a transformative agenda will no \ndoubt be slowed.\n\nKenya believes in a better, happier and more \nprosperous future for all. It is my hope that the confluence \nof forces that have come together to continually make \nour development efforts unnecessarily difficult will \nbe persuaded with urgency, to reassess their motives \nand hopefully re-engage within the global community \nand with our country and region in a more positive, \nconstructive and humane manner; recognizing that, in \nthe end, no one people, nor one country, not even any \none continent, can inhabit the world peaceably alone \nin isolation from the rest of the globe. We are in this \nworld together to succeed together, to win together and \nto build a better future for all everywhere, together."

        "file_text": "Like the \nother Heads of State and Government who preceded \nme at this rostrum, I, too, would like, on behalf of the \ndelegation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and on my own behalf, to \nextend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on \nyour well-deserved election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session and to assure you of \nour full support throughout your mandate. Your election \nto this post does honour to your country, Uganda, and, \nbeyond its borders, to the entire African continent.\n\nMy congratulations also go to His Excellency John \nAshe, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session, for his outstanding guidance of the work \nof the Assembly throughout the past year. I should \nlike in particular to commend the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his dedication to the objectives \nand ideals of the Charter of our Organization.\n\nNow that the stage has been set and the ground \nprepared, as we were urged to do at the sixty-eighth \nsession, the time is now ripe to translate into reality our \ncommitment and our vision of a world free from the \nravages of the poverty and vulnerability that still affect \nmillions of individuals.\n\nI welcome, therefore, the relevance and the scope \nof the theme of this session, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d, which is taking place in the framework of \nthe continuation of the previous session and reflects \nour commitment to meet together the challenge of \ndevelopment.\n\nSince the adoption of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), in September 2000, and one year before \nthe deadline for their implementation, it should be \nnoted, as rightly stressed by the Secretary-General in \nhis recent report, that the main objectives have been, or \nare in the process of being, achieved on a global scale \nand that considerable efforts will be needed in order \nfor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa to in their turn \nsucceed in doing so.\n\nAt the national level, thanks to the efforts of my \nGovernment, the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is tirelessly being pursued within \nthe framework of the implementation of the national \ndevelopment programme and the strengthening of \ncooperation with our partners. We will use the time \nbetween now and the deadline of the end of 2015 to \naccelerate efforts to reduce poverty, improve maternal \nand child health, consolidate the remarkable progress \nmade in the fight against HIV/AIDS and concerning \naccess to primary education, and, finally, ensure access \nto clean drinking water for all of our compatriots.\n\nIn the past three years, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has \nmade a significant qualitative leap forward in the \nimplementation of the MDGs and intends to continue \nwith that same dynamic process. We entered the \ntwenty-first century determined to conquer poverty \nand inequality, and to build a world of opportunity. The \nMDGs have been the vehicle for this great ambition and \nthe impetus for a solidarity of the kind rarely expressed \nin this forum. At a time when the world that we wish to \nsee post-2015 is taking shape, the MDGs are becoming \nclearer. We must finally give the most vulnerable \npeoples a decent life; we must also give our planet a \nreprieve and the opportunity to exist for centuries to \ncome.\n\nThe post-2015 agenda should pay particular \nattention to the priorities of the developing countries, \nparticularly those of African countries, as set out in the \nAfrican Common Position, which my country supports. \nThe intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should therefore be inclusive and \nbalanced and achieve specific, measurable objectives \nso as to facilitate their ownership by States and regions.\n\nThe adoption of the post-2015 development \nprogramme next year will take place in a favourable \neconomic context for Africa. Indeed, Africa has become \none of the most attractive regions for international \ninvestors and one of the most dynamic in the world, \nwith the annual growth rate of its gross national product \nat 4.5 per cent on average over the past 15 years. \nAfrica offers unique opportunities in the areas of \ninfrastructure, energy, agriculture, employment and the \ncapability of ensuring food security for the continent. \nThe health sector and that of combating climate change \nare also active.\n\nAfrica is entering an era of progress and development \nthat will depend on its security environment. Indeed, \nthe unprecedented spread of terrorism from the Horn \nof Africa to the Sahelo-Saharan area, the explosion of \nmaritime piracy, various types of criminal trafficking, \nand, more recently, the resurgence of pandemics such \nas Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which has been ravaging \ncertain countries in West Africa, are threatening the \nAfrican continent and risk making it lose a decade of \nhuman progress and economic growth. Unlike the wars \nof yesteryear, these trans-border threats will in the long \n\n\nterm spare no State and no region. That is why we must \nface them collectively.\n\nThe current international mobilization against \nterrorism and extremism is very positive. However, it \nwould benefit from being extended to Africa in order \nto sustainably destroy the terrorist movements that are \nnow active at the doors of Europe. Africa must not be \nthe forgotten continent in the fight against terrorism.\n\nI know that Africa is not alone in facing these \nthreats. I would like to reiterate here my sincere \ngratitude to our bilateral and multilateral partners, \nincluding France, the United States of America, the \nUnited Nations, the European Union and the African \nUnion, which all are by our side. I should like in \nparticular to thank President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande for the \ndecisive role played by France in the resolution of the \ncrises in Mali, Guinea-Bissau and the Central African \nRepublic, as well as for the convening of the Elys\u00e9e \nSummit for Peace and Security in Africa and the recent \nconference of heads of State on the question of Boko \nHaram in Nigeria.\n\nI wish to thank President Barack Obama for the \nimportant measures he announced in August at the \nUnited States-Africa Summit, which will help to \nstrengthen African capacities to combat terrorism. I \nalso wish to thank him, and, through him, the American \npeople for the bold, outstanding measures taken by the \nGovernment of the United States of America to help \nWest Africa to overcome the Ebola epidemic. Those \nmeasures, in addition to those taken by the World \nHealth Organization, non-governmental organizations, \nFrance, the United Kingdom, the World Bank, Japan, \nthe European Union and other countries, must serve as \nan impetus for an international mobilization.\n\nIn the same spirit, I would like to acknowledge \nthe support provided by the international community \nto the brotherly country of Nigeria in its fight against \nthe terrorist group Boko Haram, and commend the \nAfrican Union for its decisive involvement in Somalia. \nThe fact remains that, with respect to the Sahel and the \nfight against Boko Haram, the major Powers and the \nUnited Nations need to go further in their support for \nthe continent and show the same determination as that \nhas been demonstrated by France against the terrorists \nin northern Mali.\n\nFor Africa, security is the primary sustainable \ndevelopment goal that must be achieved. In the quest \nfor stability and security, the consolidation of the \ncontinent\u2019s various partnerships is a true lifeline to \nthe future. Those partnerships also provide solidarity, \nopenness and development. They must ultimately enable \nus to pursue together the fight for the eradication of \npoverty, while taking into account the three dimensions \nof sustainable development: the economic, social and \nenvironmental dimensions.\n\nSustainable development is inclusive, and that is \nwhat we want for our people. In that respect, I recall \nthe need to focus on developing methods for cleaner \nproduction and for reversing the current trend of global \nwarming. In the light of the pronouncements we made \nat the Climate Summit, held on 23 September here in \nNew York, a final effort will certainly be needed to \nreach an ambitious climate agreement in 2015 at the \nParis summit.\n\nI would like now to turn to the situation in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire. My country is at peace and at work. It has \nregained its partners\u2019 trust, as shown in particular by \nthe definitive return of the African Development Bank \nto Abidjan. Thanks to the unity of Ivorians, the strength \nof our national institutions and the reforms undertaken \nby the Government, economic growth continues to be \nstrong and is close to reaching double digits.\n\nAt this stage in my country\u2019s path towards \neconomic transformation and inclusive development, \nthe major work that remains is that of strengthening \nnational reconciliation and caring for and protecting the \nmost vulnerable of my countrymen. That will involve, \nfundamentally, restoring meaning to the concept of \nsolidarity and the national pact underpinning the Ivorian \nnation. Today, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is an ambitious nation that \nhas set a course towards democratic institutions and \nexemplary governance.\n\nLet me conclude by highlighting that a better world \nfor all is possible. We all need to believe in it and \nwork with determination to achieve it. The sustainable \ndevelopment goals will be achieved if national efforts are \nsupported by the expected level of official development \nassistance, the level to which the developed countries \nhave committed. The post-2015 development agenda \nwill be an asset that will enable our countries to meet \nthe challenges our people and especially our youth will \nface in a changing world.\n"

        "file_text": "I am greatly honoured \nto address this forum and to share with the General \nAssembly the views of the Republic of Macedonia on \nissues of global concern. In the current dynamic, hyper-\nconnected and changing world, one thing remains \nconstant \u2014 the need for greater predictability, a quality \non which peace, security and stability depend, as well \nas global welfare and progress.\n\nHumankind today faces many challenges, of which \ntwo demand our full attention. The first one relates \nto the natural world, and the second relates to the \ninternational order. The root of the first challenge is the \nhuman neglect of natural laws. The second challenge \narises from the violation of international law.\n\nGuided by the idea that man is the measure of \nall things, humankind has made a wrong calculation. \nWe are competing in a race for progress and new \ndiscoveries that goes hand in hand with a race for the \n\nunequal exploitation of resources \u2014 a race whose only \nrule is that there are no rules. Everything is possible \nand everything is allowed, including the pollution of \nthe air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that \nproduces our food.\n\nAs humankind, we were selfishly focused on \nimmediate needs and desires. We forget that natural \nresources have been given to us in trust to preserve for \nour children. In opposing nature, we are undermining \nthe foundations of our future. Our citizens, States and \neconomies have already begun to pay the price. We will \nface a period of extreme weather conditions, when it \nwill become ever more likely that cities will be flooded, \nrivers will dry up, crops will fail and the price of food \nwill increase.\n\nNatural disasters at the global level serve as loud \nalarms telling us that climate change is a new reality that \nis changing our lives and the lives of future generations. \nRecently our region, South-Eastern Europe, was hit by \nsuch a disaster and reminded of that reality.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia is the first country in \nour region to have completed its third national report \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. We have already defined the next \nsteps in all key sectors of the economy and society at \nthe national and local levels for disaster risk reduction \nand climate change adaptation by promoting strategies \nand efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nincrease energy efficiency.\n\nWe welcome the initiative of the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, His \nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, to take decisive and \nconcrete measures to remedy two of the world\u2019s great \nmiseries: increased global poverty and diminished \naccess to basic resources, including clean water, \neducation, health care and a clean environment.\n\nHere at the United Nations, we are all one family; \nas a family, we should help each other to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. But we must focus \non two things, that is, reducing global poverty and \nensuring sustainable development.\n\nNext year will be one of great expectations \nworldwide, including the expectation that a genuine \nsynergy involving all the major challenges will finally \nbe achieved, inter alia, climate change adaptation, \ndisaster risk reduction and sustainable development. \nWe expect the post-2015 development agenda to include \nglobal, holistic, scientifically grounded, feasible and \nlegally binding goals aimed at ensuring a safer world \nfor our descendants. However, we should be aware that \nthe natural balance is disturbed and that many things \nwill therefore not be as before. We will need to learn to \nlive in a changed world.\n\nJust as the challenge posed by nature is a result \nof the human neglect of natural laws, the challenge \nto the international order arises from the violation of \ninternational law by some countries. I said before that \nwe are all one United Nations family. And in every \nfamily there are rules of conduct and mutual respect. \nFamilies without such rules are known as dysfunctional \nfamilies.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia is strongly committed \nto respecting the Charter of the United Nations, which \nis one of the primary foundations of the purposes \nand principles of international law. The rule of law is \nincomplete and impossible without respect for human \nrights. As a member of the Human Rights Council, the \nRepublic of Macedonia is committed, in spirit and with \ndetermination, to protecting and promoting human \nrights and the right to human dignity throughout the \nworld. The Republic of Macedonia has achieved the \nhighest standards of respect for human rights and the \nrights of communities worldwide. That is possible \nthanks to the Macedonian model of coexistence as a \nmodel of integration without assimilation, which is \nnot based on tolerance alone, but rather on respect for \ndiversity.\n\nIn fact, the human rights and human dignity of \nMacedonian citizens are being continually denied \nby one Member of the United Nations family and a \nmember of NATO and the European Union. Identity \nand language are inseparable parts of our personality, \nof freedom of expression, of human rights. Those are \nuniversally accepted principles that should never be \ncompromised. Respect for human rights, including \nthe rights to self-identification and human dignity, \nrepresent the highest values of the United Nations and \nare among the political criteria for the Republic of \nMacedonia\u2019s accession to the European Union.\n\nThe country that is blocking my country is \ndemanding the impossible, namely, that we give up the \nMacedonian identity, thereby violating the fundamental \nprinciples of the European Union in order to meet \nconditions for membership in it. That would force my \ncountry to violate a rule and betray the global family.\n\nIn 2008 at the NATO Summit in Bucharest, \nbasing its position on international law, my country \n\nrefused to change the identity of the Macedonian \npeople as a precondition for its already well-deserved \nmembership in NATO. On 17 November 2008, we \nlaunched proceedings against our southern neighbour \nunder the auspices of the International Court of Justice, \nagain acting on the basis of international law. On \n5 December 2011, on the basis of international law, the \nInternational Court of Justice ruled that the obstruction \nof the Republic of Macedonia\u2019s integration in NATO \nwas illegal and that international commitments had \nbeen violated. For years my country has tolerated \nunprincipled and illegal blockades, and we have done \nso because of international law \u2014 because we believe \nthat only international law can provide predictability \nand certainty on behalf of world order.\n\nBy our example we have demonstrated in principle \nhow other countries should respect international law. \nEven the International Court of Justice, in an almost \nunanimous decision, concluded that we had acted \ncorrectly. Despite that, the Republic of Macedonia \nis ready for a mutually acceptable solution under the \nframework provided by United Nations resolutions, the \nInterim Accord and the judgment of the International \nCourt of Justice. The issue of identity has never been \npart of that framework, because identity can neither be \ndiscussed nor negotiated. I therefore urge the United \nNations and the competent authorities to become \nengaged and to devote maximum attention to finding \nmutually acceptable solutions within the framework of \ninternational law.\n\nTwo years ago, I was at the General Assembly (see \nA/67/PV.12) and remember well that the session was \npreceded by the High-level Meeting on the Rule of \nLaw at the National and International Levels (see A/67/\nPV.3). The General Assembly debated the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report (A/66/749) entitled \u201cDelivering justice: \nprogramme of action to strengthen the rule of law at \nthe national and international levels\u201d. Two years have \npassed, and we are still debating. We are still waiting \nfor rulings of the International Court of Justice to be \nrespected.\n\nOur southern neighbour continues daily to violate \ninternational law. It continues to violate the various \n1993 United Nations resolutions on the subject, as \nwell as the 1995 Interim Accord. It also still ignores \nthe ruling of the highest legal authority in the world. \nBut that ruling does not apply only to the State that \nblocks us, the ruling applies, erga omnes, to all member \nStates of the international organizations that still block \nour membership. Every blockade in our European \nand Euro-Atlantic integration process undermines the \ninternational legal order. By tolerating the blockades, \na dangerous precedent is created, one of mutual \nblocking and blackmailing that is motivated by narrow \nnational interests at the expense of the collective \ninterests of the European Union and NATO. Hence, \ndysfunctional families are created that do not respect \nthe rules of conduct. Disrespect for the highest legal \nauthorities implies an erosion of the culture of respect \nfor international law in the world. Such an erosion \nsuspends the rule of law and leaves room for anarchy.\n\nFor years, we have pertinently pointed out that, \nif someone pollutes the spring, then its flow and the \nentire watershed will also be contaminated. If someone \nquestions basic human rights \u2014 the right to human \ndignity and the right to self-identification \u2014 then \nthe rest of international law will also be challenged. \nWe have warned of the violation of international law \nin the case of the Republic of Macedonia, but others \nhave rarely listened. Today, the price we pay is higher. \nEveryone calls upon international law when others are \nexpected to respect it, but they ignore it when they \nthemselves must respect it. We do not want to follow \nthe example of those who break the law, because we are \naware of the consequences.\n\nIf we remove one link, one factor or one participant \nfrom an ecosystem, that can cause instability and \nunpredictability in its functioning. We live in a \nworld and an age of global interdependence, a \nglobal ecosystem. When a State fails to comply with \ninternational commitments, it encourages others to do \nthe same. Today we are witnessing the consequences \nof such behaviour. Under the conditions of an impaired \ninternational legal system, the world has been rapidly \nsinking into the dark areas of anarchic international \nrelations.\n\nThe world order is in a latent crisis. The processes of \nglobal interdependence and subnational fragmentation \nhave transformed our previous perceptions of the \nworld. In less than a decade, we have experienced two \nmajor changes. The terrorist attacks of 11 September \n2001 shook the global political and security order, and \nthe collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 \nstruck the global economic order. The only remaining \norder of the world we used to know is the international \nlegal order. However, the legal system has been \nchallenged as well.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia sees its future in \nNATO and the European Union. With its expansion \npolicy, the European Union has long served as a beacon \nlighting the path for the States of East and South-East \nEurope towards the more advanced European family. \nWe were recently informed that this beacon will go out \nof service in the next five years. If it does, there will be \nthe danger of shipwreck. The region of South-Eastern \nEurope remains vulnerable. I want to send a message \nto partners in the European Union that by postponing \nits enlargement, the EU has been creating a vacuum in \nwhat has been historically the most porous geopolitical \nspace. Sooner or later, that vacuum will be filled. \nThat is why we need as soon as possible to integrate \nall the Balkan countries within the European Union. \nWhile the membership card is not that important for us, \nthe necessary membership criteria and standards are \nimportant. In our case, the European Union\u2019s beacon has \ngrown dim because of its toleration of a devaluation of \ninternational law, human rights and the right to human \ndignity, which provide the essential fuel that powers the \nbeacon. In losing its light, the European Union is losing \nwhat has been most valuable \u2014 its power to motivate \nStates to strive for even higher values, standards and \ncriteria.\n\nI also want to send a clear message to my region \nthat in these circumstances, now is the time for Balkan \ncountries to demonstrate maximum solidarity and \nunity in achieving shared goals \u2014 cooperation on such \nissues as integration, our economies, infrastructure, \nenergy, environmental protection, terrorism and the \nsuppression of organized crime. We must resist and \njointly address those shared challenges. In a world that \nis rapidly changing, the need for greater predictability \nin international relations remains. Only international \nlaw can offer the reliability and predictability on which \nworld peace and the progress of our countries depend. \nInternational law is the only barrier that protects us \nfrom a disaster within the international order, and \ninternational law has been constantly breached.\n\nWe are in this Hall today as the highest \nrepresentatives of our countries in the world family. I am \nconfident that most members of the General Assembly \nagree with those conclusions. But the question is, how \nmany of us are willing to take action to change things. \nI wish that we were not in a situation where we could \nsimply debate and draw conclusions over and over again. \nIt is high time that we start with actions. This is the last \ncall. We should ask ourselves whether the natural order \nhas an alternative and what that might be. Our failure to \ncomply with natural laws has led to accelerated climate \nchange \u2014 to more floods, earthquakes and fires. The \nfailure to comply with international law has contributed \nto increased anarchy in international relations and \ninterventions against those who have flooded, burned \nand destroyed the natural order today.\n\nNot long ago, in August, the sixth United Nations \nAlliance of Civilizations Forum, held in Bali, focused \non unity in diversity. While the world has been talking \nabout unity in diversity, radical extremists have become \nunited in their intentions to destroy those who differ. As \nwe speak, millions of faithful believers around the world \nfeel the pain caused by narrow-minded individuals and \ngroups imbued with religious fundamentalism. As we \nspeak, the systematic destruction of individuals and \ncommunities is occurring. As we speak, hundreds of \nthousands are being persecuted. Their homes have \nbeen devastated, their temples destroyed and their past \nerased, and their future is in question.\n\nRecognizing that terrorism cannot and should not \nbe identified with any religion, nation or civilization, \nwe strongly condemn mass atrocities committed by \nanyone anywhere. We commend yesterday\u2019s debate in \nthe Security Council (see S/PV.7272). What we need \nare urgent measures. The Republic of Macedonia has \nalready taken the first steps. Recently, we adopted \namendments to the criminal code regarding foreign \nfighters, who are a real threat to the entire region. \nEverything that is happening in the crisis hotspots \nreflects on Europe, which has its own crisis hotspot \nnow in Ukraine.\n\nIt is sad that in the twenty-first century we have \nwitnessed tragedies in the Middle East and North \nAfrica. It is sad that this is happening in Europe, in \na year that has been declared an international year of \npeace. It is obvious that, on the centenary of the First \nWorld War, the lessons of the past have not yet been \nlearned.\n\nThe majority of victims of the Ukraine crisis are \ninnocent civilians. There have also been material losses. \nThe Republic of Macedonia supports all efforts aimed \nat restoring peace and stability in that country. I am \nconvinced that political dialogue and diplomacy will \nenable Ukraine to address the challenges and regain its \npath towards a prosperous future for its citizens.\n\nThe world is facing serious challenges, including \nnatural disasters and political issues \u2014 both of which \n\nmask double standards. Double standards generate \nissues that introduce equations with many unknowns, \nleading to a world where the only thing we are certain \nof is that the future of our children is uncertain. \nOnly respect for international law will ensure greater \ncertainty, thereby helping to avoid storms in our \ndynamic world.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia supports the reform \nof the Security Council as a significant part of the \noverall reform of the United Nations. It is a complex \nand sensitive process. We agree with the proposal to \nnegotiate the actual text. At the same time, we stress \nthat the text must receive maximum support from the \nmembership and ensure respect for international law \nand international commitments and rules. Such reform \nmust provide greater predictability in the world. As \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the opening \nof the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, \n\u201cWe shall have neither peace nor development without \nrespect for human rights and the rule of law\u201d (A/67/PV.6, \np. 3). Only international law provides the opportunity \nto solve the equation and thus to plan the future, based \non security, stability and peace.\n\nYoung people continue to be the main victims of \ndouble standards and violations of the norms of national \nand international law by prior and current generations, \nas well as of natural disasters. They breathe the polluted \nair, drink the polluted water and eat food grown in \ncontaminated soil. They will become the victims of \nsystems of injustice unless we do something to change \nthat.\n\nIn 2003, we initiated the first Forum of the Dialogue \namong Civilizations, which was held in Ohrid under \nthe leadership of former President Trajkovski. The \nDialogue among Civilizations, both chronologically \nand in essence, predated the United Nations Alliance \nof Civilizations, which was formed in 2005 at the \ninitiative of the Governments of Spain and Turkey. \nIndeed, only through dialogue will we join together in \nan alliance of civilizations. The Brdo-Brijuni Process \nMeeting was recently held with the participation of \nthe German Chancellor, Her Excellency Mrs. Merkel. \nAn entire chapter of the joint declaration is devoted \nto youth. As President of the Republic of Macedonia, \nit will be my honour to organize, together with the \nDirector-General of UNESCO, Ms. Irina Bokova, the \nupcoming Dialogue among Civilizations in 2015, which \nwill be entirely dedicated to youth.\n\nIn the year when we are marking the centenary of \nthe First World War, we recall the positive experiences \nof Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in \nestablishing the Franco-German Youth Office in 1963. \nThat experience of cooperation among young people \nshould be applied in establishing an office for young \nEuropeans from all the countries of South-Eastern \nEurope, transforming our region into a Europeanized \nBalkans. We call on the leaders to devote greater time \nand attention and invest in youth. We cannot change \nour past, but we can, by changing the present, change \nthe past of the generations to come. That is why it is \nnecessary to educate young people about the importance \nof dialogue, which involves respect and the acceptance \nof diversity.\n"

        "file_text": "I am Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez. I was born in \na humble village called Rio Grande, in the department \nof Lempira, a region with very high rates of inequality \nand poverty, although that is now changing, as is my \nwhole country. I am here in my capacity as President \nof Honduras, a country located in the heart of the \nAmericas. It is a country small in size, but with a great \ndesire to achieve development based on its own identity, \nand with a people who struggle daily to advance and \nprogress, and who aspire to better living conditions.\n\nIn 2009, our country suffered one of the worst \npolitical crises in its history. It led to several hundred \nmillion dollars in losses, and most unfortunately, to \nthousands of divided families and more poverty. That \ncrisis caused more damage than any hurricane or \nnatural disaster. However, today we can say that we \nhave overcome the political crisis.\n\nHonduras is a country where full democracy is \npractised and there is complete freedom to choose its \nleaders. In addition to representative democracy, we \npractice participatory democracy. Proof of that is the \ndialogue that will lead to a compact for Honduras that \nwill be the result of listening to the views of different \nsectors of society on central issues for our people. Our \nEveryone for a Better Life Plan includes four basic \npillars: restoring peace, generating investment and \nlarge-scale employment opportunities, supporting \nfamilies living in extreme poverty, and combatting \ncorruption and promoting greater transparency in the \nculture of the Honduran people.\n\nSince taking office eight months ago, I have been \ncompletely devoted to recovering and maintaining \npeace and tranquillity, creating opportunities with fairer \nconditions for everybody. We need more investment to \ncome to our country in order to create jobs that will \ntranslate into greater income for our families. To that \nend, Honduras has amended its Constitution to create \none of the best platforms in the world for investment and \nemployment. It is a very innovative. I am referring to \n\n\nthe Zone for Employment and Economic Development, \nwhich is better known by its acronym ZEDE.\n\nThe Honduras ZEDE model is not just another free \ntrade zone, similar to the 3,500 that already exist in the \nworld. Ours is different because it is comprehensive. It \nis a jurisdiction with four dimensions: legal, economic, \nadministrative and political. The Honduran ZEDE \nis a L.E.A.P. zone, which in English means \u201cto jump \nforward\u201d. In Honduras, the ZEDE will help us take a \ncompetitive leap forward towards greater well-being. \nRather than joining the race to the bottom, Honduras \nhas decided to compete upwards, welcoming global \ninvestment through a special jurisdiction of the highest \nlevel to employ the most productive and profitable \nworkforce in a highly favourable location at the centre \nof the Americas, bringing the Pacific and the Atlantic \ntogether.\n\nIn the legal dimension, ZEDE offers a common law \nsystem, with compulsory arbitration and international \njudges. Economically speaking, we are competitive in \nan open market, with a series of agile simple regulations, \nwith highly attractive and sustainable incentives for the \ncreation of good jobs under decent conditions. In the \nadministrative dimension, ZEDE provides a technical, \nnon-political structure without bureaucratic obstacles \nthat is effective for companies that must operate at the \nspeed of the markets and technology in the twenty-\nfirst century, and with full guarantees of transparency \nand security within the rule of law. Finally, to attract \nlong-term investment and ensure good jobs, we \nguarantee political stability and transparency based \non international treaties and agreements, with the \nsupport of an international commission of 21 trustees to \nensure compliance with best practices for workers and \nthe investors. I invite everyone to discover the great \nopportunity Honduras offers the world.\n\nWe have also created a participatory model \nof Government enterprises and the private sector, \nwith mixed capital \u2014 in other words public-private \npartnerships. We are building an interoceanic logistical \ncorridor linking the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, \nallowing us to move cargo between both Oceans in less \nthan six hours \u2014 I repeat, less than six hours. Our hope \nis to capture at least 5 per cent of the demand to move \ngoods from one ocean to another.\n\nWe have made progress, but we also recognize that \nmuch remains to be done. For example, there has been a \nrise in the number of Hondurans going abroad, including \nan unusual migration of children and vulnerable youth \nto North America, many unaccompanied by an adult. \nThis migration is the result of the violence created by \nthe movement of drugs through our territory, poverty \nand the lack of opportunities. Special attention must be \ndedicated to this phenomenon, especially in countries \nthat are responsible for the problem either because \nthey produce the drugs or because they are the market \nwhere the drug is consumed. We believe that this is a \nshared responsibility. Faced with the scant interest in \nsolving the problem shown but those who created it, we \nHondurans must stress this issue in every forum that \nwe possibly can, because we must speak clearly and \nforcefully about that issue.\n\nHonduran territory is today one of the main \nbattlefields of a war that is not our own. We did not start \nthis war. Its strategies are decided outside Honduras, \nand it involves drug-consuming countries in the North \nand drug producing countries in the South. It is a real \nmonster \u2014 a multinational, criminal octopus without \nnationalities, borders or scruples, which is dedicated \nto the trafficking, trade and consumption of drugs and \nto encouraging demand, especially in the wealthiest \nsocieties.\n\nThe drugs transiting through Honduras and \nCentral America destroy the lives and peace of our \npeople, our youth, our children and our women. From \nthose who orchestrate and organize the transnational \nactivity within our territory to ordinary citizens and the \nchildren involved as pawns in drug dealing and addicts, \nall are affected. They are all embarking on the path of \nno return, which will tear apart our society, destroy \nfamilies, corrupt officials and destroy institutions. I \ninvite members to ask themselves: Who are the real \nculprits in this cycle of death, misfortune, mourning, \nstruggle, blood and pain? It is not Hondurans, I can \nassure the Assembly of that.\n\nIn forums such as this, we need to agree on the \nbasic contours of the issue and the facts. We cannot, \nin the midst of crisis and without coming to useful or \nconcrete conclusions, put forward proposals based on \nlegalizing production and consumption, on the one \nhand, and on waging a merciless war on trafficking and \nillegal drug use, on all fronts and regardless of cost, \non the other. I ask myself, and I invite members to ask \nthemselves: Who are the true victims of this tragedy? \nAll those who cannot live in peace in modern society \nare victims, as are those who cannot live in society \nwithout using drugs. Society itself is a victim, as it is \nunable to organize its efforts and manage its resources \nin a rational manner so as to create new opportunities.\n\n\nHonduras produces and consumes practically no \ndrugs. We are a transit country. Unfortunately, we \nprovide only the battlefield and the dead. We provide \nthe resources to combat drugs\u2019 transit through our \nterritory, and those are resources that we are prevented \nfrom investing in meeting our development problems \nand challenges. I repeat: we are not responsible for the \nwar.\n\nI think it is time to do what we have to do: respect \nhuman rights; follow what experts and our common \nsense are telling us; attack the problem at its root, \nonce and for all; and do it together and throughout the \naffected region. We must create a multinational force \ncapable of dealing successfully with a phenomenon \nthat is transnational in terms of its organization, its \nmarket, its projections and its financing. This morning, \nPresident Obama called for such unity in fighting radical \nfundamentalists. I would ask: What is the difference \nbetween the effects of terrorist acts perpetrated by \nradical fundamentalists and the effects of the terrorist \nacts perpetrated by those who traffic in drugs? What is \nthe difference?\n\nToday the international community is discussing \nwhat happens in other regions of the world when \nchildren, young people and families are displaced by \nwar, violence and radical extremists. Those are all \nsituations that we as a nation also condemn. Of course \nwe do. However, little is being said and about the \nthousands of families living in the northern triangle \nof Central America. I do not want to believe that this \nissue will simply be forgotten. As human beings, we \ncannot allow that to happen. I would once again ask \nthe Assembly: What is the difference between those \ndisplaced by violence in other regions and those \ndisplaced by the violence committed by drug traffickers \nand transnational criminals? What is the difference?\n\nOne difference is that those displaced \u2014 those \nthousands of families and individual children \u2014 come \nknocking on the doors of the United States of America. \nAs a region, we cannot continue to ignore this human \ndrama, which affects thousands of Central Americans, \nespecially unaccompanied migrant minors who, on \ntheir way to the United States, have been the victims of \nviolence, transnational crime, rape, human trafficking \nand the organ trade. Many have died or disappeared \nin the desert. We cannot forget that. Those children \ndeserve to be treated with dignity and respect. They \nare innocent victims. We are talking about innocent \nchildren just like our children and grandchildren. They \nare vulnerable human beings.\n\nI would like to inform the Assembly that yesterday, \nthe Secretary-General kindly agreed to have me, along \nwith the ministers of Guatemala and El Salvador, \npresent to him the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in \nthe Northern Triangle, which maps out an initiative to \nsupport and create opportunities so that our countrymen \nare able to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity \nwith everyone in our region \u2014 and I repeat, everyone, \nbecause this cause is our common responsibility.\n\nAn important part of the solution to the child \nmigration problem is to create job opportunities for \ntheir parents there, in Central America, and to improve \nsecurity for young people there, in Central America. \nBoth issues are closely linked to the trade policies \nof the United States. We are not asking for financial \nassistance or charity. What we are asking for is just and \nequitable trade treatment, as is already given to other \ncountries in the world. What we want is to jobs, to create \nthose opportunities. Honduras supports efforts to unite \nthe world in peace and prosperity through just trade \nand better access to major world markets. Within that \nvision, and in the context of the current negotiations, \nwe demand that Honduras and Central America receive \nthe same commercial treatment as Asian countries do, \nin order to enable us to compete.\n\nTo be frank, the United States giving preferential \ntariffs and rules of origin to other countries and leaving \nHonduras and Central America out of that would lead \nto thousands of jobs being lost in our region and would \nlead more children to illegally cross the border. I say to \nPresident Obama, Congress, the North American people \nand the people of the world: Honduras is committed to \nsolving the child migration issue and to fighting drug \ntrafficking. Many of them know this, clearly, given our \ndetermination. But if there is not a reasonable degree of \ncoherence in our countries\u2019 trade policies, as partners, \nwhat is the real message to our people in Central \nAmerica? What should Honduran children and their \nparents expect, in Central America?\n\nGiven the many problems we face as Hondurans, \nwe have learned to see every crisis as an opportunity, \nand my Government follows the Christian principles of \nsolidarity and the common good. We are promoting a \nvery ambitious programme called A Better Life, through \nwhich we are making small changes and solving big \nproblems. I am pleased to note that, now, some of those \nwith the biggest fortunes are also promoting solidarity. \nI invite us all to ask: How much money is enough for a \nhuman being to feel fulfilled?\n\n\n(spoke in English)\nHow much money is good enough?\n\n(spoke in Spanish)\nA few days ago we read about the humanitarian \naction being undertaken by one of the world\u2019s richest \nmen, Mr. Bill Gates, who, through his foundation, is \nseeking A Better Life in terms of health for thousands of \npoor families by promoting scientific research into new \ndesigns for basic sanitation systems. I think Mr. Bill \nGates found the answer to the question.\n\n(spoke in English)\nHow much money is good enough?\n\n(spoke in Spanish)\nAs we are working on the same issue, I take this \nopportunity, with the Assembly\u2019s permission, to invite \nMr. Bill Gates, a citizen of the world, to my country to \nwork on this common endeavour.\n\nIt is very encouraging that some of the wealthiest \npeople in the world are not seeking the secret of eternal \nyouth, or trying to send expeditions to other planets \nwhile our brothers are dying on this one. On the \ncontrary, they are aware of the problems of their poorer \nbrethren. This is going on in many countries, including \nHonduras, where many good businesspeople have \nsigned on to work with our A Better Life programme \nand are demonstrating social responsibility by creating \njobs. And that is what this is all about \u2014 solidarity \nand social responsibility, but not romantic social \nresponsibility. In that regard, I would like to quote Pope \nFrancis, a citizen of the world, whose words I hope will \nring in our ears.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a moving van following a funeral \nprocession, but there is a treasure we can take with \nus, a treasure that no one can take away \u2014 not \nthose things we have kept for ourselves, but what \nwe have given to others\u201d.\nWe should think about that and consider those \nwords. Honduras is a country where 43 per cent of the \npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day, which is not \nenough to pay for a person\u2019s basic nutritional needs. \nThat is why we are making a major effort to respond to \nthese people\u2019s needs through the Better Life programme, \nthus enabling them to live with dignity. The Better \nLife programme is designed to respond to the needs of \n835,000 families, who are getting help in improving \ntheir homes, including providing access to drinking \nwater and basic sanitation, decent roofs overhead and \nfloors underfoot, family gardens and monetary support \nto ensure that children attend school, have improved \nhealth care and change their living conditions so as to \nachieve a better life.\n\nOur housing improvements include the use of \nclean stoves, reducing wood consumption and smoke, \nwhich is harmful to women and children\u2019s health and \nwhich, according to the World Health Organization, \nkills 500,000 women around the world every year. In \nCentral America alone, about 35,000 people die from \nthe wood smoke emitted from dirty cooking stoves \nevery year. With every eco or clean stove installed, we \nmake a contribution to the rest of humankind by saving \n15 medium-sized trees every year, thus helping to \nprotect the environment. In that regard, I would like to \nhighlight the work of former United States Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton for her Global Alliance for Clean \nCookstoves initiative, whose goal is to put clean stoves \nin 100 million households by 2020. On this subject we \nshare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vision and are working hard to \nachieve it.\n\nWhen presidents come to the General Assembly of \nthe United Nations, they often prepare speeches they \ndeem most appropriate and specific to the lofty heights \nof this great forum, but beyond the words themselves, \nthe message I want to convey is that the most important \nthing is for all of us to be accepted as citizens of the \nworld, with the same duty to fight and defend our \nterritory, our families and our planet, with the same \nright to aspire to a better life, and that what is vital is \nthe support of those who have the most to those who \nhave the least. If my message today can reach and move \na few to act, I think it will have been worth coming. I \nwould like to remind the Assembly that if we are part of \nthe largest forum in the world, it is because we consider \nourselves to be citizens of the world, human beings \nwith the same dignity, and therefore all of us, everyone \nof us, equal. Honduras is making progress; Honduras is \nchanging; Honduras sends its greetings to all.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to convey our congratulations to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-ninth session. We wish him success in the coming \nyear.\n\nWe are not living in the worst of times, but they \nare not the best of times either. Standards of living are \nfar higher for more of the human race than ever before. \nBut we face global crises of several types: internal \nand cross-border conflicts, epidemics, disasters both \nnatural and man-made, climate change and international \ncrime. We are facing grave threats from terrorism and \nextremism. The latest manifestation is the Islamic \nState in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). It is brutal and \ncruel and a travesty of all that religion stands for. Its \nunspeakable acts of cruelty, including abductions and \nbrutal murders of civilians, constitute crimes against \nhumanity. Singapore condemns those terrorist actions \nin the strongest possible terms. ISIS will continue to \ntarget those who do not conform to its extremist agenda.\n\nThe threat of such terrorism and radical ideology \nis not confined to the Middle East. It affects the whole \nworld. An estimated 15,000 foreigners from at least \n80 countries, including from South-East Asia, have \ntravelled to Syria and Iraq to fight. That fact that ISIS \ncan attract so many foreign fighters highlights the \nneed for a comprehensive strategy to counter them. In \naddition to military and intelligence efforts, we must \nalso combat the radical ideology used to recruit foreign \nfighters, which fuels their extremist agenda.\n\nSingapore firmly supports all international and \nregional cooperation efforts. We welcome the strong \nleadership of the United States, in particular in the \nformation of the international coalition to combat the \nISIS threat. We also welcome the Jeddah Declaration \nby Arab countries to stand united against ISIS. Security \nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist \nfighters, which Singapore co-sponsored, is an important \nstep to combat global terrorism and will be critical to \ncutting off financial and material support for ISIS and \npreventing the movement of foreign terrorist fighters. \nNo country can insulate itself from those problems. \nWe need to combat them at all levels. Fair economic \ndevelopment, good governance and political and social \nstability will be critical in increasing a country\u2019s \nresilience against those threats.\n\nThe President\u2019s choice of the theme \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d for this year\u2019s session and his \nemphasis on a comprehensive, action-oriented post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda are particularly timely. Singapore \ncommends the work of the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals and looks forward to \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s report of its recommendations.\n\nWe also welcome the contributions of major \nforums, such as the Third International Conference on \nSmall Island Developing States (SIDS), recently held \nin Samoa. Singapore had the privilege of co-chairing \nthe preparatory committee for that forum with New \nZealand. It is important that the views and concerns \nof small States be properly factored into the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) were successful due to the pragmatic, \noutcome-based and quantifiable approach to the \nTargets. We hope that same approach will be taken in \nrespect of the post-2015 development agenda. Those \nMDGs that were not fully achieved should be included \nas an intrinsic part of the post-2015 agenda. \n\nRegarding the principles for sustainable development, \nSingapore is participating actively in the discussions \nfor the post-2015 period, focusing on those areas where \nwe can contribute \u2014 key principles that were critical \nto our development path and might be relevant to other \ndeveloping countries. \n\nFirst is the principle of honest and competent \ngovernment. Corruption is a drag on development and \nan intrinsic source of social instability. Fighting it \nneeds political will, strong leadership and unceasing \nvigilance from the whole society. \n\nSecondly, rule of law is integral to sustainable \ndevelopment. Governments need sound and effective \ninstitutions. Those institutions, including the civil \nservice, the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, \nmust be built on core principles of equal justice and \nmeritocracy, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender. \nSocial capital \u2014 the trust that people have in one \nanother, their leaders and the system \u2014 is as necessary \nto sustainable development as financial capital. \n\nThe third principle is that economic and social \npolicy must be pragmatic, not dogmatic. Singapore \ndoes not advocate any standard model of government \n\n\n\f\nor economic structure. The only model is to work with \nwhat you have within the context of a country\u2019s culture \nand resources, prudently and for the benefit of the \npeople. Policies have to be judged by their outcomes, \nnot according to ideological content. Both consistent \nattention and responsive implementation are necessary \nto achieve long-term goals. We will put those ideas \nforward during the discussion.\n\nSince the urban centres of small States tend to have \ndisproportionately large social, political and economic \nweight in the country, a dysfunctional urban centre can \nhave a much greater negative effect on a small country \nthan on a big one. Today, slightly more than half of the \nworld\u2019s population live in cities. By 2050, that will go \nup to 70 per cent. Most of that growth will take place \nin Africa, Asia and Latin America. As noted on page \n17 of the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, cities \nare where the battle for sustainable development \nwill be won or lost. Mismanaged urbanization can \nintensify inequalities. Asia is already home to 61 per \ncent of the world\u2019s slum dwellers, and Africa is home \nto about 26 per cent. The Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development has predicted that by \n2030, 2 billion people could live in urban poverty. They \nwill be at risk from overcrowding, epidemics, crime \nand pollution.\n\nYet, urbanization has in fact been significant \nin the progress towards achievement of the MDGs, \nespecially in reducing poverty. Successful cities bring \nup their rural hinterlands. Today, cities account for \nover 80 per cent of global gross domestic product. The \noutcome document of the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex) \nitself recognizes that well-planned cities promote \neconomically, socially and environmentally sustainable \nsocieties. They are engines for growth and are more \nresource-efficient than rural societies.\n\n\nThe challenge is therefore really to manage \nurbanization well. Singapore has been contributing to the \ndiscussions on sustainable urbanization as co-chair of \nthe Group of Friends on Sustainable Cities. Singapore\u2019s \nCentre for Liveable Cities was established in 2008 to \ndistil, create and share knowledge on sustainable cities. \nIt has developed a Liveability Framework as a tool to \nanalyse what a sustainable city would actually entail \nand help countries define the policies they need to \nachieve that goal. To us, a sustainable city means having \na competitive economy, environmental sustainability \nand a high quality of life for all inhabitants, rich and \npoor alike. We hope that the Liveability Framework can \nbe incorporated as part of discussions for the United \nNations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban \nDevelopment \u2014 Habitat III \u2014 in 2016.\n\nIn the area of water and sanitation, last year \nSingapore submitted resolution 67/291 to the General \nAssembly to designate 19 November as World Toilet \nDay in the context of Sanitation for All. This year, we \nwill observe that Day together with relevant United \nNations agencies and civil society organizations by \nfocusing on the serious problems faced by women and \ngirls who lack basic sanitation access. That issue needs \ngreater attention than it has received so far.\n\nWhat is the way forward? Once the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda has been agreed, countries will \nneed to consider implementation. South-South, North-\nSouth and triangular cooperation in capacity-building \nand sharing experiences are important parts of the way \nforward. In our early years, Singapore benefited from \nthe expert advice of specialized agencies, international \norganizations and developed countries. In 1992, we set \nup the Singapore Cooperation Programme to share our \ndevelopment experience, the successes and the failures \nalike, with other developing countries. The Programme \nis designed to build capacity in fields that could \nbe of interest to countries, in the hope that that will \nsmooth their developmental path. Recently, at the third \nSmall Island Developing States Conference in Samoa, \nSingapore launched a dedicated package for SIDS.\n\nSingapore supports the universal and inclusive \napproach to the post-2015 development agenda. Each \nsociety must draw its own lessons from its own \nexperiences and find solutions according to its national \ncircumstances. Naturally, there will be differences of \nopinion, but we must not lose sight of the ultimate goal \nof ending extreme poverty in our lifetimes. With the \nMDGs, we managed to halve the number of people \nliving below the poverty line, and there is real hope \nthat we can do even better.\n\nLet us all work together to ensure that by the \nseventieth anniversary of the inception of the United \nNations, in 2015, we can unite around a clear vision \nof how to provide our future generations the future we \nwant.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me start \nby congratulating you, Mr. Kutesa, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. I am confident that the Assembly will \nmake meaningful progress during this session under \nyour able leadership. I would also like to express my \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntireless efforts to tackle the numerous crises breaking \nout around the globe.\n\nNext year marks the seventieth anniversary of the \nfounding of the United Nations. I am prompted by the \nstate of our world today to reflect once again upon the \nnoble dreams and ideals that inspired the founders of \nthe United Nations 70 years ago. The founders aspired \nto build a new world that places people at the centre, as \nthe opening words of the Charter of the United Nations, \n\u201cWe the peoples\u201d, remind us. Throughout the ensuing \ndecades of the Cold War and the post-Cold-War era, the \nUnited Nations tackled countless crises, striving, as it \ndid so, to fulfil its purpose of maintaining international \npeace, promoting development and upholding human \nrights.\n\nYet our world continues to be beset by widespread \ndisputes and conflicts, both large and small, despite \nthe efforts of the United Nations. The civil conflicts \nraging on in Syria, Libya and South Sudan are causing \nthe deaths of untold numbers of innocent women and \nchildren. In Iraq and surrounding areas, the activities \nof foreign terrorist fighters are posing new threats to \npeace internationally, not to mention in the Middle \nEast. The fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine call \nfor more fundamental and lasting solutions. The recent \nEbola outbreak in Africa, widespread poverty and \nnatural disasters underscore the scope of the threat \nfrom multiple challenges.\n\nIn order to push back against those challenges \nto peace and development, we need to return to the \nfounding spirit of the United Nations by putting people \nfirst and promotinge cooperation among the Members \nof the family of nations. To meet the aspirations of \nthe international community for justice and common \nprosperity, the United Nations needs to continue to \nplay a central role in arranging more rapid and efficient \nresponses.\n\nThe Republic of Korea was founded in 1948 with the \nblessing of the United Nations. It was able to safeguard \nfreedom and democracy during the Korean war that \nbroke out two years later, again with the help of the \nUnited Nations. Once a country that barely managed to \nsurvive with United Nations assistance, the Republic \nof Korea is today a nation that has achieved both an \nadvanced market economy and democracy. In the course \nof that journey, the Republic of Korea came to espouse \nthe values upheld by the United Nations \u2014 peace, \ndevelopment and human rights \u2014 as its own vision.\n\nGiven its history, the Republic of Korea is no \nstranger to the agonies of the civil wars, aggression, \npoverty and humanitarian disasters that are unfolding \naround the world. That is why the Republic of Korea \nis actively working to serve international peace and \npromote human rights and sustainable development \nas a member of the three major Councils of the United \nNations: the Security Council, the Human Rights \nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.\n\n\nThe developments unfolding in the Middle East, \nEurasia, and North-East Asia are a far cry from the \npeaceful and just world that was envisioned by the \nUnited Nations founders. Overcoming the instability \nand chaos we see today must start with our adherence \nto the fundamental order and norms of the international \ncommunity, namely, respect for sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity; refraining from the threat or use of \nforce in violation of the Charter; and respect for human \nrights and humanitarian values.\n\nWe need to prevent the development and \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as \nnuclear weapons, which pose a fundamental threat to \ninternational peace and security. In that regard, we \nwelcome the elimination of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons \nthrough the joint efforts of the United Nations and the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \nand the progress being made in addressing the Iranian \nnuclear issue.\n\nBy the same token, I would underline the urgency \nof resolving the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nnuclear issue, which presents the single greatest threat \nto peace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East \nAsia. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is \nthe only country to have conducted a nuclear test in \nthe twenty-first century. Its nuclear programme not \nonly is a serious threat to international peace, but \nalso amounts to a total rejection of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is the \nbackbone of the global nuclear non-proliferation \nregime. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nmust make the decision to give up its nuclear weapons. \nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea should \nfollow in the footsteps of other countries that have \nabandoned their nuclear weapons in favour of reform \nand opening-up, and it must choose a different path that \nsupports its economic development and improves the \nlives of its people. Should it do this, the Republic of \nKorea, together with the international community, will \nprovide our strong support for developing the economy \nof the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nIn addition to that serious challenge on the Korean \nPeninsula, North-East Asia is undergoing a difficult \ntransition. There are growing tensions in the region \nsurrounding issues of history, territory and maritime \nsecurity. Yet, unlike other regions, North-East Asia \nlacks a mechanism for dealing with those problems \nthrough multilateral consultations. It is against that \nbackdrop that I am seeking to advance a North-East \nAsia peace and cooperation initiative that is aimed \nat building an order of trust and cooperation in the \nregion. In my view, building up habits of cooperation in \npractical areas, such as climate action, disaster relief, \nnuclear safety and tackling transnational crime, can \nmaterialize into a multilateral process of cooperation \nalong the lines of what we see in Europe.\n\nIn that context, I have also proposed creating a \nNorth-East Asia nuclear safety consultative body to \ndiscuss nuclear safety issues, a topic of shared interest \nfor the countries in the region. At the same time, we \nare reaching beyond North-East Asia and seeking to \nbuild transportation and energy networks across an \neconomically interdependent Eurasia, which would \nhelp strengthen political trust and security across the \ncontinent.\n\nThis year marks 20 years since the Rwandan \ngenocide, the world\u2019s greatest humanitarian tragedy of \nthe late twentieth century. The international community \nhad pledged \u201cnever again\u201d in the aftermath of the \ngenocides in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the \n1990s. Yet, we are witnessing today a different type of \nhumanitarian disaster unfolding in Syria and Iraq. The \nRepublic of Korea is actively participating in the efforts \nof the United Nations to prevent such humanitarian \ntragedies. The Republic of Korea strongly supports \nUnited Nations policies to protect human rights, such \nas the Rights Up Front initiative and the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s \u201copen gate\u201d policy. Even as we speak, Korean \ntroops are taking part in United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions in South Sudan and Lebanon, helping with \npeacebuilding, reconstruction and the protection of \ncivilians and human rights.\n\nThe Republic of Korea also attaches great \nimportance to preventing human suffering, particularly \nof women and children, who are most vulnerable, \nin conflict situations. In that context, during its \npresidency of the Security Council in February 2013, \nKorea presided over an open debate (see S/PV.6917) on \nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict and helped \nraise global awareness. Korea is also participating in and \nchampioning the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. \nSexual violence against women during armed conflicts \nis a clear violation of human rights and humanitarian \nnorms, regardless of how long ago or where it occurred.\n\nThe human rights situation in the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea is also the subject of \nprofound interest and concern for the international \n\n\ncommunity. In March, the Human Rights Council \nadopted recommendations proposed by the Commission \nof Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea and the international community should \ntake the necessary measures to implement those \nrecommendations. In that regard, the United Nations \noffice that will soon be set up in the Republic of Korea \nto investigate human rights abuses in the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea is expected to reinforce such \nefforts. The international community should also pay \ngreater attention to the human rights situation of North \nKorean defectors. The relevant United Nations agencies \nand countries should provide the necessary support \nso that defectors can freely choose their resettlement \ndestination.\n\nThe challenges facing humankind today, such as \nabsolute poverty and climate change, can be addressed \nonly through a concerted international response, given \ntheir complexity and intertwined character. Less than \n500 days remain until the target date of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which was launched with the \naim of eradicating absolute poverty and increasing \nsocial and economic opportunities. The Republic of \nKorea is ready, by harnessing our unique historical \nexperience, to play a bridging role between developed \nand developing countries as the post-2015 development \ngoals are set. In that regard, the decision was made as \na result of the Busan Partnership agreement, adopted \nat the Ministerial Meeting in April in Mexico, to turn \nthe Global Partnership for Effective Development \nCooperation into an international development \ncooperative mechanism.\n\nThe Republic of Korea will seek to enhance the \nquality of its overseas assistance. We will continue \nto share our development experience, by globally \npromoting the Saemaul movement model, which was \nconducive to eradicating rural poverty in Korea through \nthe spirit of diligence, self-reliance and cooperation. \nHaving seen the power of education in propelling its \nown development, the Republic of Korea strongly \nsupports and is championing the Secretary-General\u2019s \nGlobal Education First Initiative. Korea will share its \nlessons learned and provide substantive support to the \nUnited Nations initiatives on education, which is one of \nthe main themes of the post-2015 development goals. To \nthat end, Korea will host the World Education Forum \nin 2015 and make efforts to reach an agreement on the \nnew education objectives for the next 15 years.\n\nClimate change is no less an existential threat \nto humanity than the question of war and peace. At \nthe Climate Summit 2014 held at United Nations \nHeadquarters yesterday, 23 September, leaders \nproclaimed their collective resolve to reach a consensus \non the post-2020 new climate regime. Going forward, \nan agreement must be reached on a new climate regime \nby the 2015 Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \nParis. As the host country of the Green Climate Fund \n(GCF) and the Green Growth Global Institute (GGGI), \nKorea is committed to supporting international efforts \nto strengthen developing countries\u2019 mitigation and \nadaptation capacities. Above all, we will continue to \nwork for the full and early operationalization of the GCF \nand for the expansion of GGGI assistance to developing \ncountries. Korea views the climate challenge not as a \nburden but as an opportunity to unleash new value, \nmarkets and jobs through technological innovation. \nWe are nurturing new energy industries. And we hope \nto share the fruits of our efforts with other developing \ncountries.\n\nThe Korean people gained independence 69 years \nago, but the subsequent division of the Korean peninsula \nprecluded its membership in the United Nations as a \nsingle sovereign State. The two Koreas were admitted \nseparately as Member States to the United Nations \nin 1991. Having two separate seats despite a single \nlanguage, culture and history is clearly not normal. \nThis year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall \nof the Berlin Wall, but the Korean peninsula remains \nstifled by a wall of division. Countless separated \nfamilies have been spending decades in agony, longing \nto see their loved ones. Every year, many leave for a \nplace where they will never be able to meet their loved \nones in person. I call on the international community to \nstand with us in tearing down the world\u2019s last remaining \nwall of division.\n\nNot long ago, I proposed to the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea that we build corridors that \ncan connect our environment, our livelihoods and our \nculture. In my view, a genuine community that can heal \nthe wounds of division and move both sides forward \ntogether will come about only when people from the \nSouth and the North are able to live in natural harmony \nwithin a single ecosystem, when separated families are \nable to come together and ease their agony, and when \nculture is shared.\n\nToday, the Korean peninsula is divided by a \n4-kilometre wide, 250-kilometre long demilitarized \n\n\nzone (DMZ). The DMZ, built around the military \ndemarcation line to prevent renewed conflict, has \nin reality ended up preventing the back-and-forth \nmovement of people for some 60 years. But from the \nstretches of the DMZ would emerge, in those decades, a \ntreasure trove of nature\u2019s wildlife. The DMZ ecosystem \nis a testament to the fact that the South and North are \npart of a single whole, one which both sides should \nwork together to restore. And so I hope to build inside \nthe very symbol of our division a world ecopeace park \nthat would begin to reconnect the Peninsula\u2019s divided \nnature and divided people. If we can sweep away the \nbarbed-wire fences from small areas inside the DMZ \nand thereby allow people from both sides to live in \nnatural harmony, such a park could emerge as a corridor \nof life and peace.\n\nI call on the United Nations to spearhead these \nefforts. Building a park that embodies respect for \ninternational standards and values, and doing so under \nUnited Nations auspices, with all the parties to the \nwar on board \u2014 the two Koreas, the United States and \nChina \u2014 would serve to ease tensions and promote the \npeaceful reunification of the two Koreas. A unified \nKorea would be a starting point for a world without \nnuclear weapons, offer a fundamental solution to the \nNorth Korean human rights issue and help unlock a \nstable and cooperative North-East Asia. Just as the \nunification of Germany laid the ground for a new Europe \nby integrating that continent, a unified Korea could set \nin motion a new North-East Asia. I am confident that a \npeacefully reunified Korean peninsula will contribute \nto realizing the founding purposes and values espoused \nby the United Nations.\n\n\nThe founders of the United Nations were not \ndeterred by the heat of war from looking to the future and \nplanning for a peaceful post-war world. The Republic \nof Korea is committed to a vision of diplomacy that \nseeks lasting peace and unification on the peninsula \nand peace and development in North-East Asia and \ncontributes to building a happier world. The Republic \nof Korea will do its part in that noble undertaking to \nensure that the United Nations continues to safeguard \nour common values and cements its place at the centre \nof global governance.\n"

I have come \nto expose the brazen lies spoken from this very rostrum \nabout my country and the brave soldiers who defend it.\n\nThe people of Israel pray for peace, but our hopes \nfor peace, and those of the world, are in danger, because \neverywhere we look militant Islam is on the march. It \nis not militants; it is not Islam; it is militant Islam, and \ntypically, its first victims are other Muslims. But it \nspares no one. Christians, Jews, Yazidis, Kurds \u2014 no \ncreed, no faith, no ethnic group is beyond its sights, \nand it is rapidly spreading in every part of the world. \nWe know the famous American saying \u201cAll politics is \nlocal\u201d. For the militant Islamists, all politics is global, \nbecause their ultimate goal is to dominate the world.\n\nNow that threat might seem exaggerated to some, \nsince it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a \nparticular part of the body. But left unchecked, the \ncancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider \nareas. To protect the peace and security of the world, \nwe must remove that cancer before it is too late. Last \nweek, many of the countries represented here rightly \napplauded President Obama for leading the effort \nto confront the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \n(ISIS); and yet weeks before, some of those same \ncountries \u2014 the same countries that now support \nconfronting ISIS \u2014 opposed Israel for confronting \nHamas. Evidently, they do not understand that ISIS and \nHamas are branches of the same poisonous tree.\n\nISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed that they \nboth seek to impose well beyond the territory under their \n\n\ncontrol. Let us listen to what ISIS\u2019s self-declared Caliph, \nAbu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, said two months ago. He said \nthat the day would soon come when the Muslim would \nwalk everywhere as a master, and that Muslims would \ncause the world to hear and understand the meaning of \nterrorism, and destroy the idol of democracy. Now let \nus listen to Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas. He \nproclaims a similar vision of the future. \u201cWe say this to \nthe West\u201d, he says. \u201cBy Allah it will be defeated, and \ntomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world\u201d.\n\nAs its Charter makes clear, Hamas\u2019s immediate \ngoal is to destroy Israel; but it has a broader objective. \nIt also wants a caliphate. Hamas shares the global \nambitions of its fellow militant Islamists, and that is \nwhy its supporters cheered wildly in the streets of Gaza \nwhen thousands of Americans were murdered on 9/11. \nThat is why its leaders condemned the United States \nfor killing Osama Bin Laden, whom they praised as a \nholy warrior. When it comes to their ultimate goals, \ntherefore, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.\n\nAnd what they share in common, all militant \nIslamists share in common \u2014 Boko Haram in Nigeria, \nAl-Shabaab in Somalia, Hizbullah in Lebanon, Al-Nusra \nin Syria, the Al-Mahdi Army in Iraq and the Al-Qaida \nbranches in Yemen, Libya, the Philippines, India and \nelsewhere. Some are radical Sunnis, some are radical \nShiites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate \nfrom the seventh century. Others want to trigger the \napocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century.\n\nThey operate in different lands. They target \ndifferent victims. They even kill each other in their \nbattle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic \nideology. They all seek to create ever expanding \nenclaves of militant Islam, where there is no freedom \nand no tolerance, where women are treated as chattel, \nChristians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, \nand sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die. \nFor them, anyone can be consider an infidel, including \nfellow Muslims.\n\nMilitant Islam\u2019s ambition to dominate the world \nseems mad, but so too did the global ambitions of \nanother fanatic ideology that swept into power eight \ndecades ago. The Nazis believed in a master race. The \nmilitant Islamists believe in a master faith. They just \ndisagree as to who among them will be the master of \nthe master faith. That is what they truly disagree about. \nTherefore, the question before us is whether militant \nIslam will have the power to realize its unbridled \nambitions.\n\nThere is one place where that could soon \nhappen \u2014 the Islamic State of Iran. For 35 years, Iran \nhas relentlessly pursued the global mission that was set \nforth by its founding ruler, Ayatollah Khomeini, with \nthe following words:\n\n\u201cWe will export our revolution to the entire world, \nuntil the cry \u2018There is no God but Allah\u2019 will echo \nthroughout the world over\u201d.\nEver since, the regime\u2019s brutal enforcers, Iran\u2019s \nRevolutionary Guards, have done exactly that. Let us \nlisten to its current commander, General Mohammad \nAli Jafari, who clearly stated that goal:\n\u201cOur Imam did not limit the Islamic Revolution to \nthis country. Our duty is to prepare the way for an \nIslamic world Government.\u201d\nIran\u2019s president, Mr. Rouhani, stood here last \nweek and shed crocodile tears over what he called the \nglobalization of terrorism. Maybe he should spare us \nthose phony tears and have a word instead with the \ncommanders of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. He could \nask them to call off Iran\u2019s global terror campaign, \nwhich has included attacks in two dozen countries \non five continents since 2011 alone. To say that Iran \ndoes not practice terrorism is like saying Derek Jeter \nnever played shortstop for the New York Yankees. The \nbemoaning by the Iranian President of the spread of \nterrorism has got to be one of history\u2019s greatest displays \nof double talk.\n\nSome argue that Iran\u2019s global terror campaign \u2014 its \nsubversion of countries throughout the Middle East \nand well beyond the Middle East \u2014 is the work of the \nextremists. They say that things are changing. They \npoint to last year\u2019s election in Iran. They claim that \nIran\u2019s smooth-talking President and Foreign Minister \nhave changed not only the tone of Iran\u2019s foreign policy \nbut also its substance. They believe that Rouhani and \nZarif generally want to reconcile with the West, that \nthey have abandoned the global mission of the Islamic \nRevolution. Really?\n\nLet us look at what Foreign Minister Zarif wrote in \nhis book just a few years ago:\n\n\u201cWe have a fundamental problem with the West, \nand especially with America. This is because we \nare heirs to a global mission which is tied to our \nraison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d. \nA global mission which is tied to our very \nreason for being? Then Zarif asks a question \u2014 an \ninteresting question, in my view. He says, \u201cHow come \nMalaysia\u201d \u2014 referring to an overwhelmingly Muslim \ncountry \u2014 \u201cdoes not have similar problems?\u201d Then he \nanswers: \u201cBecause Malaysia is not trying to change the \ninternational order\u201d. That is our moderate.\nLet us not be fooled by Iran\u2019s manipulative charm \noffensive. It is designed for one purpose and one purpose \nonly \u2014 to have the sanctions lifted and the obstacles to \nIran\u2019s path to the bomb removed. The Islamic Republic \nis now trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement \nthat will remove the sanctions it still faces and leave it \nwith the capacity of thousands of centrifuges to enrich \nuranium. That would effectively cement Iran\u2019s place as \na threshold military nuclear Power. In the future, at the \ntime of its choosing, Iran, the world\u2019s most dangerous \nregime, in the world\u2019s most dangerous region, would \nobtain the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons. Allowing \nthat to happen would pose the gravest threat to us all.\n\nIt is one thing to confront militant Islamists on \npickup trucks armed with Kalashnikov rifles. It is \nanother thing to confront militant Islamists armed with \nweapons of mass destruction. I remember that last year \neveryone here was rightly concerned about the chemical \nweapons in Syria, including the possibility that they \nwould fall into the hands of terrorists. Well, that did \nnot happen, and President Obama deserves great \ncredit for leading the diplomatic effort to dismantle \nvirtually all of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons capability. \nWe can only imagine how much more dangerous \nthe Islamic State \u2014 ISIS \u2014 would be if it possessed \nchemical weapons. Now, let us imagine how much \nmore dangerous the Islamic State of Iran would be if it \npossessed nuclear weapons.\n\nWould you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let \nISIS build a heavy-water reactor? Would you let ISIS \ndevelop intercontinental ballistic missiles? Of course \nyou would not. Then you must not let the Islamic \nState of Iran do those things either, because if you do, \nhere is what will happen. Once Iran produces atomic \nbombs, all the charm and all the smiles will suddenly \ndisappear \u2014 they will just vanish. It is then that the \nayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their \naggressive fanaticism on the entire world.\n\nThere is only one responsible course of action to \naddress this threat. Iran\u2019s nuclear military capabilities \nmust be fully dismantled. Make no mistake \u2014 ISIS \nmust be defeated, but to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as \na threshold nuclear Power is to win the battle and lose \nthe war.\n\nThe fight against militant Islam is indivisible. When \nmilitant Islam succeeds anywhere, it is emboldened \neverywhere. When it suffers a blow in one place, it is set \nback in every place. That is why Israel\u2019s fight against \nHamas is not just our fight; it is everyone\u2019s fight. Israel is \nfighting a fanaticism today that other countries may be \nforced to fight tomorrow. For 50 days this past summer, \nHamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, many of \nthem supplied by Iran. I want members to think about \nwhat their countries would do if thousands of rockets \nwere fired at their cities. Let them imagine millions \nof their citizens having seconds at most to scramble to \nbomb shelters, day after day. Members would not let \nterrorists fire rockets at their cities with impunity, nor \nwould they let terrorists dig dozens of terror tunnels \nunder their borders to infiltrate their towns in order to \nmurder and kidnap their citizens. Israel justly defended \nitself against both rocket attacks and terror tunnels.\n\nYet Israel faced another challenge. We faced a \npropaganda war because, in an attempt to win the world\u2019s \nsympathy, Hamas cynically used Palestinian civilians \nas human shields. It used schools \u2014 not just schools, \nUnited Nations schools \u2014 private homes, mosques \nand even hospitals to store and fire rockets at Israel. \nAs Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers and \nat the tunnels, Palestinian civilians were tragically but \nunintentionally killed. There are heartrending images \nthat resulted, and these fuelled libellous charges that \nIsrael was deliberately targeting civilians. We were not. \nWe deeply regret every single civilian casualty.\n\nAnd the truth is, Israel was doing everything to \nminimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas was \ndoing everything to maximize Israeli civilian casualties \nand Palestinian civilian casualties. Israel dropped \nflyers, made phone calls, sent text messages, broadcast \nwarnings in Arabic on Palestinian television \u2014 all \nthis to enable Palestinian civilians to evaluate targeted \nareas. No other country and no other army in history \nhave gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among \nthe civilian population of their enemies.\n\nSuch concern for Palestinian life was all the more \nremarkable given that Israeli civilians were being \n\nbombarded by rockets, day after day, night after \nnight. And as their families were being rocketed by \nHamas, Israel\u2019s citizen army, the brave soldiers of \nthe Israel Defense Forces, our young boys and girls, \nupheld the highest moral values of any army in the \nworld. Israel\u2019s soldiers deserve not condemnation \nbut admiration \u2014 admiration from decent people \neverywhere.\n\nHere is what Hamas did. Hamas embedded \nits missile batteries in residential areas and told \nPalestinians to ignore Israel\u2019s warnings to leave. \nAnd just in case people did not get the message, they \nexecuted Palestinian civilians in Gaza who dared to \nprotest. And, no less reprehensible, Hamas deliberately \nplaced its rockets where Palestinian children live and \nplay.\n\nLet me show the Assembly a photograph. It was \ntaken by a France 24 crew during the recent conflict. \nIt shows two Hamas rocket launchers, which were used \nto attack us. Three children can be seen playing next to \nthem. Hamas deliberately put its rockets in hundreds \nof residential areas like this \u2014 hundreds of them. That \nis a war crime. I say to President Abbas, these are the \ncrimes \u2014 the war crimes \u2014 committed by his Hamas \npartners in the national unity Government which he \nheads and for which he is responsible. These are the \nreal war crimes he should have investigated or spoken \nout against from this rostrum last week.\n\nAs Israel\u2019s children huddle in bomb shelters and \nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome missile defence knocked Hamas \nrockets out of the sky, the profound moral difference \nbetween Israel and Hamas could not have been clearer. \nIsrael was using its missiles to protect its children; \nHamas was using its children to protect its missiles.\n\nBy investigating Israel rather than Hamas for war \ncrimes, the United Nations Human Rights Council has \nbetrayed its noble mission to protect the innocent. In \nfact, what it is doing is to turn the laws of war upside \ndown. Israel, which took unprecedented steps to \nminimize civilian casualties, is condemned; Hamas, \nwhich both targeted and hid behind civilians \u2014 that is a \ndouble war crime \u2014 is given a pass. The Human Rights \nCouncil is thus sending a clear message to terrorists \neverywhere: \u201cUse civilians as a human shield. Use \nthem again and again and again.\u201d And you know why? \nBecause, sadly, it works. By granting international \nlegitimacy to the use of human shields, the Human \nRights Council has become a terrorist rights council, \nand it will have repercussions \u2014 it probably already \nhas \u2014 in terms of the use of civilians as human shields. \nIt is not just our interests and values that are under \nattack: it is the interests and values of all of us.\n\nWe live in a world steeped in tyranny and terror, \nwhere gays are hanged from cranes in Tehran, political \nprisoners are executed in Gaza, young girls are abducted \nen masse in Nigeria and hundreds of thousands are \nbutchered in Syria, Libya and Iraq, yet nearly half of \nthe Human Rights Council\u2019s resolutions focusing on a \nsingle country have been directed against Israel \u2014 the \none true democracy in the Middle East; Israel, where \nissues are openly debated in a boisterous Parliament, \nwhere human rights are protected by independent \ncourts, and where women, gays and minorities live in a \ngenuinely free society.\n\nThe biased treatment of Israel by the Human Rights \nCouncil \u2014 that is a misnomer, but I will use it just the \nsame \u2014 is only one manifestation of the return of one \nof the world\u2019s oldest prejudices. We hear mobs today in \nEurope calling for the gassing of Jews. We hear some \nnational leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is \nnot a function of Israel\u2019s policies; it is a function of \ndiseased minds, and that disease has a name. It is called \nanti-Semitism. It is now spreading in polite society \nwhere it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel. \nFor centuries, the Jewish people have been demonized \nwith blood libels and charges of deicide. Today, the \nJewish State is demonized with the apartheid libel and \ncharges of genocide.\n\nIn what moral universe does genocide include \nwarning the enemy civilian population to get out \nof harm\u2019s way or ensuring that they receive tons of \nhumanitarian aid each day, even as thousands of rockets \nare being fired at us, or setting up a field hospital \nto aid their wounded? I suppose it is the same moral \nuniverse in which a man who wrote a dissertation of \nlies about the Holocaust and who insists on a Palestine \nfree of Jews \u2014 Judenrein \u2014 can stand at this rostrum \nand shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic \ncleansing. In the past, outrageous lies against the Jews \nwere the precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our \npeople. But no more; today, we the Jewish people have \nthe power to defend ourselves. We will defend ourselves \nagainst our enemies on the battlefield and we will expose \ntheir lies against us in the court of public opinion. Israel \nwill continue to stand proud and unbowed.\n\nDespite the enormous challenges facing Israel, I \nbelieve we have a historic opportunity. After decades of \nseeing Israel as their enemy, leading States in the Arab \nworld increasingly recognize that together we and they \nface many of the same dangers. Principally, that means \na nuclear-armed Iran and militant Islamist movements \ngaining ground in the Sunni world. Our challenge is to \ntransform those common interests in order to create a \nproductive partnership that would build a more secure, \npeaceful and prosperous Middle East. Together we can \nstrengthen regional security. We can advance projects \nin water, agriculture, transportation, health care, energy \nand so many other fields.\n\nI believe that the partnership between us can also \nhelp facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \nMany have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian \npeace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement \nbetween Israel and the Arab world. But I believe that, \nthese days, it may work the other way around, namely, \nthat a broader rapprochement between Israel and the \nArab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian \npeace. Therefore, to achieve that peace, we must look \nnot only to Jerusalem and Ramallah but also to Cairo, \nAmman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere. I believe \nthat peace could be realized with the active involvement \nof Arab countries that are willing to provide political, \nmaterial and other indispensable support.\n\nI am ready to make a historic compromise, and not \nbecause Israel occupies a foreign land. The people of \nIsrael are not occupiers in the land of Israel. History, \narchaeology and common sense all make clear that we \nhave had a singular attachment to this land for over \n3,000 years. I want peace because I want to create a \nbetter future for my people. But it must be a genuine \npeace, one that is anchored in mutual recognition and \nenduring security arrangements \u2014 rock-solid security \narrangements \u2014 on the ground. Israel\u2019s withdrawal \nfrom Lebanon and Gaza created two militant Islamic \nenclaves on our borders from which tens of thousands \nof rockets have been fired at Israel. Those sobering \nexperiences heighten Israel\u2019s security concerns \nregarding potential territorial concessions in the future.\n\nThose security concerns are even greater today. Let \nus just look around. The Middle East is in chaos. States \nare disintegrating, and militant Islamists are filling \nthe void. Israel cannot have territories from which it \nwithdraws taken over by Islamic militants yet again, \nas happened in Gaza and Lebanon. That would place \nthe likes of ISIS within mortar range, a few miles of \n80 per cent of our population. Think about that. The \ndistance between the 1967 lines and the suburbs of \nTel Aviv is similar to the distance between United \nNations Headquarters and Times Square. Israel is a tiny \ncountry. That is why in any peace agreement, which \nwill obviously necessitate a territorial compromise, I \nwill always insist that Israel be able to defend itself, by \nitself, against any threat.\n\nYet despite everything that has happened, some still \ndo not take Israel\u2019s security concerns seriously, but I do \nand I always will. That is because as Prime Minister of \nIsrael I am entrusted with the awesome responsibility \nof ensuring the future of the Jewish people and the \nfuture of the Jewish State. No matter what pressure is \nbrought to bear, I will never waver in fulfilling that \nresponsibility.\n\nI believe that with a fresh approach on the part \nof our neighbours, we can advance peace despite the \ndifficulties we face. In Israel, we have a record of making \nthe impossible possible. We have made a desolate land \nflourish, and with very few natural resources we have \nused the fertile minds of our people to turn Israel into \na global centre of technology and innovation. Peace \nwould enable Israel to realize its full potential and to \nbring a promising future not only to our people and not \nonly to the Palestinian people, but to many, many others \nin our region. But the old template for peace must be \nupdated. It must take into account new realities and \nnew roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbours.\n\nThere is a new Middle East. It presents new dangers \nbut also new opportunities. Israel is prepared to work \nwith Arab partners and the international community to \nconfront those dangers and to seize those opportunities. \nTogether, we must recognize the global threat of \nmilitant Islam, the primacy of dismantling Iran\u2019s \nnuclear weapons capability, and the indispensable role \nof Arab States in advancing peace with the Palestinians. \nAll that may fly in the face of conventional wisdom, but \nit is the truth. And the truth must always be spoken, \nespecially in the United Nations. Isaiah, a great prophet \nof peace, taught us nearly 3,000 years ago in Jerusalem \nto speak truth to power. He said:\n\n\u201cFor the sake of Zion, I will not be silent. For the \nsake of Jerusalem, I will not be still until her justice \nshines bright and her salvation glows like a flaming \ntorch\u201d.\nLet us light a torch of truth and justice to safeguard \nour common future.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Vanuatu is honoured to \njoin other speakers in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa \non assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-ninth session. I believe that his able leadership \nwill successfully guide the session to its conclusion. \nLet me also extend my gratitude to his predecessor, \nAmbassador John Ashe, for his exemplary leadership \nand the important achievements during his tenure in \nthe past year.\n\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, \nmany major global events have taken place which, on \nthe one hand, have contributed to strengthening the \ninternational system and, on the other, have threatened \ninternational peace and security and directly derailed the \nprocess of development, resulting in the marginalization \nof the vulnerable populations of our societies. Given \npast efforts to address the global financial crisis, we \nhave witnessed some recovery of the global economy. \nThat is good news; but it is well known that the recovery \n\nis fragile and further international efforts are needed to \nensure that global growth prospects in the long run will \nremain solid and sustainable.\n\nWe are concerned about prolonged periods of \nconflict that have led to the displacement of the most \ndisadvantaged members of our societies, including \nwomen, children and the disabled. It bothers us to see \nthe increased radicalization of groups and individuals \nthat have been targeted to create terror and impose \nthreats against countries, Governments and citizens. \nThose are all problems that could be avoided, if all \ncountries adhered strictly to the peaceful principles of \ndialogue enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \nAs members of the international community, we have a \nmoral duty to ensure that the principles of dialogue and \nreasoning prevail in order to address conflict. I have \nno doubt that the multilateral system is best placed to \naddress the challenges.\n\nThe outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that \nhas claimed over 2,000 lives in West Africa has \nalso concerned us greatly. In this regard, we highly \ncommend the efforts of the United Nations agencies, \nin particular the World Health Organization, and the \ninternational community in addressing the security \nrisks of the epidemic. Likewise, the efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his determination in addressing \nthe challenges are most commendable. I would like \nto reiterate my Government\u2019s support for the ongoing \nefforts.\n\nConcerning the political developments in the Pacific \nregion, I wish to congratulate the people of the Republic \nof Fiji on successfully and peacefully electing a new \ndemocratic Government. My Government commends \nthe people of Fiji for their resilience and steadfastness, \nand I congratulate the newly elected Prime Minister on \nfulfilling his promise to the international community to \nsuccessfully lead his country to a democratic election.\n\nVanuatu, a small island developing State, has a \nsmall economy which is open and vulnerable to internal \nand external shocks. Those characteristics have \ndetermined and shaped our development outcomes. For \ndecades now, our economy has been growing and is now \ngenerating increasing per capita incomes. Vanuatu was \none of the countries that called on the United Nations to \nallow vulnerability to become one of the three criteria \nused in assessing or identifying graduation cases. \nVanuatu\u2019s vulnerability was recognized as a result of \nthe revised criteria, and our country ceased to qualify \nfor graduation. It was not until the end of the twentieth \ncentury that Vanuatu\u2019s eligibility for graduation from \nleast developed country (LDC) status was raised again, \nafter a decade of unquestionable economic progress in \nour island nation.\n\nAfter the Committee for Development Policy \nand the Economic and Social Council reviewed our \nprogress in 2012, the General Assembly, in December \n2013, decided that Vanuatu would graduate (see \nA/68/PV.59). At the same time, a grace period of four \nyears was granted to enable a smooth transition to \npost-LDC life. Vanuatu\u2019s graduation from LDC status \nis now scheduled to take place in December 2017. \nMy Government accepts that as a positive signpost. \nHowever, the issue of vulnerability must be carefully \naddressed by the United Nations.\n\nWe are examining the LDC benefits we may \neventually lose, with a view to negotiating the \npossibility of retaining certain concessions we deem \nimportant \u2014 if not vital \u2014 in sustaining economic \ndevelopment. Our impression of the graduation process \nis that our attention is being drawn to the question of \nsmooth transition, while the real issue \u2014 the question \nof vulnerability, even during the post-graduation \nstage \u2014 is being circumvented. Our situation could best \nbe described using the analogy of an aircraft. Vanuatu is \nin the descent phase, but the focus should not be on the \nsmooth landing; rather, we must look to what happens \nafter the smooth landing, as that is the real issue. Our \nvulnerabilities as a small island developing State (SIDS) \nremain undiminished, with lasting disadvantages and \ngrowing challenges regardless of our graduation from \nLDC status.\n\nWhat is it, then, that the United Nations, which has \nbeen so generous in recognizing our vulnerabilities, \ncan now offer us, as a SIDS, in support of our efforts \nto build resilience and productive capacity, and in \nsupport of our climate adaptation expenditure? Surely \nSIDS dealing with such issues deserve as much special \nattention as do LDCs. Is it unreasonable to expect \nthat attention be translated into some form of special \ntreatment for SIDS? We appreciate the focus of the \nUnited Nations on the importance of a smooth transition \nfor graduating countries, but we also urge it not to be \ndistracted from the real question, which is the way we \nSIDS will be treated after graduation.\n\nLike other, similar economies, while Vanuatu has \nmade some headway towards meeting the Millennium \n\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), it is still finding it difficult \nto achieve all of the goals by 2015. The reasons for that \nare numerous, but one of the significant difficulties is \nour narrow revenue base, coupled with a geographically \ndispersed population scattered over our 83 islands, \nwhich makes it a challenge for the Government to deliver \nbasic services to all of its people. We are grateful that \nour development partners are always there to support \nus. Given the challenges that SIDS and LDCs face \nin financing development, I appeal to the developed \ncountries to honour their commitment to increasing \ntheir aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national product, as \nagreed on in the Monterrey Consensus.\n\nThe current problem of terrorism threatens the \nsecurity of States and the safety and well-being of \ninnocent and vulnerable women and children. The \nkidnapping of innocent people, including some of \nour peacekeepers, is a threat to international security \nand peace. As a participant in various United Nations \npeacekeeping missions, I would like to express our \ngratitude to the United Nations and other countries for \ntheir assistance in negotiating the release of Fiji\u2019s United \nNations peacekeepers. The cooperation in this respect \nof members of the international community is a positive \nsign for the concept of our collective responsibility for \ninternational peace and security.\n\nWe salute the Secretary-General for his leadership \nas a vigorous campaigner for climate action and for \nconvening this year\u2019s Climate Summit. Leaders made \nmany pledges and commitments during the Summit, \nand we look forward to seeing the rhetoric translated \ninto urgent action. My delegation calls on the United \nNations family to stand together to find ways to \naddress climate-change issues. We are staring at a \nclimate-change bubble, and the longer we delay action, \nthe costlier it will be for our future generations. We \nmust act now and fast to ensure that we steer clear of \nthe current dangerous carbon-pollution trajectory.\n\nThe theme for the sixty-ninth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, is \ntimely and relevant, particularly considering the ongoing \nefforts to arrive at a new post-2015 development agenda \nfor all countries. I commend the excellent progress that \nhas been made in this area, and I recognize that it is \nnot easy to negotiate such goals, with so many member \ncountries and the different groups they represent, all of \nwhich want their development agendas incorporated. I \nbelieve that our draft agenda does represent a consensus \non the part of every United Nations Member and that it \nis capable of bringing development to a new level in all \nof our countries.\n\nAs a Pacific small island developing State, we \nare dealing with numerous development challenges \nthat the United Nations system and the international \ncommunity should address. I reiterate that climate \nchange is a major global challenge for all of us. Some \nPacific States are facing an existential threat, and we \ncannot deal with the issue of sustainable development \nalone if climate-change challenges are not addressed \nseriously by the international community. To that end, \nit is vital that climate change remain one of the major \nelements on the agenda of sustainable development \ngoals (SDGs).\n\nWe note that this is a matter for considerable debate, \nowing to its cross-cutting nature. However, it is not a \nnew issue, for the climate-change agenda is prominently \nfeatured in \u201cThe future we want\u201d outcome document \nof the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (resolution 66/288, annex). Our current \nefforts to address climate change are consistent with \nthat, and it is another reason why our climate-change \ntargets should be more ambitious. We strongly urge \nthat the target of holding the increase in global average \ntemperature below 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels be \nincluded in the SDGs.\n\nIn addition to climate change, our support for the \nSDGs extends but is not limited to the inclusion of \npeace and effective institutions; ocean management; \nhealth and education; energy security and gender \nequality. We also concur with the emphasis on the \nmeans of implementation in the report of the Open \nWorking Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (A/68/970) and urge the United \nNations and the developed countries to continue to \nsupport developing countries, especially the SIDS \nand LDCs, in the areas of sustainable development \nfinancing and improving institutional capacity in their \nefforts to promote development.\n\nCoincidentally, my country is at an important \nstage in its development planning process. Our current \ndevelopment planning framework will come to an \nend in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we are already \nconsulting for the post-2015 era. The agenda and issues \nbeing discussed in the global arena will be translated \ninto and merged with our development aspirations. \nI would like to take this opportunity to call on our \n\ndevelopment partners to support us by working in \nharmony and in a true spirit of partnership to help us to \nfulfil the dreams of our people, particularly our young \nand more vulnerable generation.\n\nMy Government acknowledges the synergy of the \nefforts being made by the United Nations and the British \nCommonwealth to uphold the international principles \nof peace and good governance, as well as in promoting \nstronger partnerships for inclusive development. I \nwould like to ask the United Nations to allow the views \nexpressed by the Commonwealth Heads of Government \non the post-development agenda to be seen as additional \ncontributions to that process.\n\nMy country has a history that evolved as the \nresult of a long political struggle to achieve political \nindependence, which finally came in 1980. But when \nmost of us were young, it was governed by Britain \nand France, and we were stateless in our own country, \nneither French nor British citizens. For more than seven \ndecades, we were exposed to foreign rule. We thus had \nto struggle to reconstruct our identity as a nation that \ncould govern itself rather than be subjected to foreign \nrule. In 1981, after independence was achieved in 1980, \nI finally arrived here at the United Nations with our late \nformer Prime Minister, Walter Lini. I clearly remember \nthat cold autumn morning, when a small group, along \nwith the United Nations protocol staff, gathered outside \nthe entrance of this magnificent building to raise our \nflag for the first time at the United Nations. A new \nnation was born and was accepted by the United Nations \nfamily of nations.\n\nAs a freedom fighter and as the Prime Minister of \nthe Republic of Vanuatu who took office less than six \nmonths ago, I proudly stand here today to thank the \nUnited Nations for the recognition and endorsement of \nour membership. But more importantly, here on this \nrostrum I want to underscore the unfinished business \nof the United Nations with regard to bringing closure \nto its work on decolonization. Part of my country\u2019s \nsovereign territory is still being disputed by one of our \nformer colonial Powers, which is also our dear friend \nand development partner.\n\nI am delighted that the United Nations once again, \nthrough the work of the former United Nations Special \nRapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, \nMr. James Anaya, brought the matter to the twenty-\nfirst session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. \nMy country is delighted that in 2012 France responded \nto that action and expressed its openness to dialogue. \nWe believe such openness is a necessary element for \nprogress so that our indigenous peoples will be able to \nresume their rights to fully exercise their cultural and \nspiritual obligations on the two islands of Umaenupne/\nMatthew and Leka/Hunter, and to revive the traditional \nroutes of our ancestors in Tafea province.\n\nMy country\u2019s political struggles have led to a strong \nposition on decolonization. We share the dreams of \nthose who are still longing for freedom so that they can \nachieve self-government and independence. As we near \nthe midpoint of the United Nations Third International \nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism, I want to \necho those voices, from within our region and beyond, \nwho should one day be able to stand on this podium as \nfree and democratic nations.\n\nMy country acknowledges the message of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, reminding the \n2014 Pacific regional seminar of the United Nations \nDecolonization Committee held in May this year \nthat \u201cgood intentions will have to be translated into \ncredible action to make the Third International Decade \na success\u201d. In that connection, my country supports \nthe conclusions and recommendations contained in the \nreport of the United Nations visiting mission to New \nCaledonia this year (A/AC.109/2014/20/Rev.1) and calls \non the United Nations and the international community \nto pursue their efforts to provide support to the people of \nNew Caledonia and the Government of France in their \nendeavour to implement a successful decolonization \nprocess under the Noum\u00e9a Accord.\n\nAt the nineteenth Melanesian Spearhead Group \nLeaders Summit in June 2013 in New Caledonia, the \nGroup\u2019s leaders renewed their commitment through \na declaration to support the Front de lib\u00e9ration \nnationale kanak socialiste (FLNKS) in their pursuit \nfor full emancipation under the Noum\u00e9a Accord, \nthrough the provision of technical assistance and \ntraining programmes for the Kanak peoples to assist \nthem in their struggle to fully exercise their right to \nself-determination and independence. While the New \nCaledonian people look forward to a political transition, \nI call upon the United Nations, through its regional \nagencies, to provide assistance to New Caledonia, in \nparticular the FLNKS and the Kanak people, in specific \nareas of training to enable them to fully participate in \nthe implementation of the Noum\u00e9a Accord. I appreciate \nthe cooperative efforts of the Government of France for \nfacilitating the implementation of the Noum\u00e9a Accord \n\nin a very mature and responsible manner. Those efforts \nmust not be derailed.\n\nI cannot close this section of my speech without \npaying tribute to the late Mr. John Ondawame, a \nfreedom fighter from West Papua, who passed away \nlast month while in exile in my country. He was laid \nto rest in my country as a hero who had fought for \nthe rights to self-determination for the people of West \nPapua. He and other martyrs had a dream that one \nday the United Nations and all nations advocating and \npromoting democratic principles would hear their cries \nand deliver on the promise of a self-determined future. \nAt his funeral service, I stated that his struggle for \nfreedom and justice would continue to be our struggle \nuntil colonialism is eradicated.\n\nThere are many other heroes in many countries \nthat are still voiceless and are suffering in silence, \neither owing to unilateral policy choices, or because \nof ignorance on the part of the multilateral system. \nMy country is encouraged by the onset of flexibility \nexercised by the United States of America towards the \nCuban people. I believe that the willingness for dialogue \nand consideration is a responsible gesture that will \nslowly open the door for a better future for all Cubans. \nWe must, as individual countries, be ready to be a voice \nfor the voiceless. Bigger and richer countries must be \nthe burden-bearers for smaller nations. In doing so, we \ndemonstrate our willingness to live as a village, a world \ncommunity of friends and not aggressors. I want to \nstress that the only way to address that issue is through \ndialogue and unity. It is our moral responsibility not to \nfail those who have been victims of past ignorance.\n\nMy country and many others have repeatedly raised \nthese concerns on this same podium for many years, \nbecause we subscribe to them as inalienable human \nrights. The concerns of vulnerability, sustainable \ndevelopment, fisheries, job creation, human rights \nand many others are reflected in the Small Island \nDeveloping States Accelerated Modalities of Action \n(Samoa Pathway) outcome document (A/CONF.223/3, \nannex). My country fully endorses the Samoa Pathway \ndocument as a guide that is to be used to navigate \nthrough our development challenges.\n\nThe Samoa Pathway, built on the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy \nfor Implementation, has charted a decisive course \ngoing forward. The United Nations system and the \ninternational community are urged to ensure that it is \nintegrated into a transformative post-2015 development \nframework and that we close the implementation gaps \nof the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \nStrategy.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to thank the \nGovernment and the people of Samoa for ably hosting \nthe third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States held in Apia.\n\nI deeply appreciate the opportunity to present my \nviews to this important forum. I hope that the statements \nand the deliberations that we make today will translate \ninto concrete actions leading to a better future for all \nour peoples. Long live our aspirations to create lasting \npeace and a better world for our people! May God bless \nthe United Nations!\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed \nan honour for me to address this body for the first time \nsince assuming the portfolio of Minister for Foreign \nAffairs a little over one year ago. I take pleasure in \nsharing the perspectives of the Government of Saint \nKitts and Nevis on matters before the General Assembly \nduring its sixty-ninth session.\n\nAllow me to start by congratulating Mr. Kutesa on \nhis election to the office of President of the General \nAssembly, to steer the course of the Assembly during \nthis session. Indeed, his sterling contribution in \nhis native Uganda, where he serves as Minister for \nForeign Affairs, and his efforts at strengthening the \nAfrican Union have prepared him for the challenging \ntask of finalizing the development of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nMy delegation wishes to commend his predecessor, \nMr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, for his \nleadership in presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. His focus on the development of the \nsustainable development goals and other issues of \nimportance to small island developing States (SIDS) \nand developing countries in particular is worthy of high \ncommendation.\n\nThe theme of the sixty-ninth session, \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d, is quite timely as we enter a new \ndispensation that reflects global priorities that were not \ncontemplated at the time the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) were conceptualized leading up to \nthe year 2000. As we work on implementing the \npost-2015 development agenda, we must ensure \nthat the 17 sustainable development goals recently \nformulated are effective in building on the foundation \nlaid by the Millennium Development Goals. It is my \ndelegation\u2019s hope that the agenda as developed will be \ntransformative in nature, with a high degree of success \nin its overarching objectives \u2014 the eradication of \npoverty and hunger, and the promotion of sustained and \ninclusive economic growth.\n\nWe are mindful that MDG 8, which calls for the \nstrengthening of global partnerships, remains part of \nthe unfinished business of the Millennium Development \nGoals established at the Millennium Summit in 2000. It \nis therefore highly important that we take great care in \nensuring that the first 16 sustainable development goals \nare buttressed by a robust suite of implementation tools \nthat will effectively serve as the catalyst for achieving \nsuccess in the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nMy delegation can never overemphasize the \nimportance of rendering effective and operational Goal \n17, which calls for the strengthening of the means of \nimplementation and the revitalization of the global \npartnership for sustainable development. We are \ntherefore heartened by the President\u2019s expressed plan to \nconvene three high-level thematic debates and one high-\nlevel event geared towards, inter alia, strengthening the \nmeans of implementation in order to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment in its three dimensions.\n\nWe pay keen attention to the first event, the \ndebate on the means of implementation. We are of \nthe view that achieving sustainable development will \nrequire mobilization and the effective use of financial \nresources and technology development and transfer, \nin addition to capacity-building at all levels. It will \nalso entail increased investment in the social sectors, \ninfrastructure, community development, climate \nfinancing and the protection of global common goods.\n\nThe key question before us in relation to the means \nof implementation is how we mobilize the significant \nresources that will be needed to turn the aspirations \nof the post-2015 development agenda into tangible \n\n\noutcomes. I wish to pledge my Government\u2019s support \nin advancing the basic thrust of the President\u2019s tenure. \nA strengthened global partnership should foster close \ncollaboration between and among Governments, \nprovide for an increased role of the private sector, \nensure a fair international trading regime, and foster \nnational and foreign direct investments.\n\nMy Government wishes to reiterate its firm \ncommitment to doing its part to ensure that we \nachieve the goals developed to sustain economic and \nsocial development in a manner that will preserve \nthe environment and ensure stable, safe and peaceful \nsocieties. Since our last address to this body, Saint \nKitts and Nevis has solidified its position as a leader in \nthe Caribbean in attracting foreign direct investment, \nspecifically in its tourism infrastructure, and \nbuilding its industrial base in the light manufacturing \nsector \u2014 electronics and electrical components. We have \nalso successfully forged public-private partnerships in \nrenewable-energy ventures providing sustained growth \nfor our economy.\n\nOne of the peculiar vulnerabilities of small island \ndeveloping States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis is \nour susceptibility to economic and external shocks, \nwhich results in a state of high indebtedness. It is \nno secret that high public debt affects the ability of \nGovernments to achieve sustainable development in all \nits dimensions. In the area of economic sustainability, \nwe developed in 2011 and successfully implemented \na comprehensive approach to the management of our \nnational debt. Our plan included debt restructuring \nwith international financial institutions, an exchange \noffer for government bonds, the curtailment of public \nborrowing to sustainable levels and a creative land-for-\ndebt swap initiative.\n\nI am pleased to report that by the end of June, we \nhad successfully reduced the ratio of our debt to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) by 50 percentage points, from \nover 145 per cent pre-restructuring to 95 per cent now. \nI am even more pleased to report that our debt-to-GDP \nratio is projected to decline further, to 85 per cent by the \nend of 2014. In spite of our fiscal discipline, however, \nit is important for us to be mindful of the fact that one \nsevere climate event can erase the gains achieved, \neffectively sending us into a vicious cycle that makes \nit difficult if not impossible to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment on the economic front.\n\nAt this juncture, I would be remiss if I failed to \necho the call for a new paradigm for the assessment \nused in the policy of graduation, which currently uses \nthe narrow policy of per capita gross national income \nto confer middle-income and high-income status on \ndeveloping countries. Saint Kitts and Nevis is of the \nview that that measure is grossly inadequate and needs \nto take into account the peculiar vulnerabilities of \nSIDS. We commend the Commonwealth secretariat \nfor the innovative work it has been spearheading to \nencourage leading international financial institutions \nto accept a broader matrix, including the vulnerability \nindex, to correctly assess the true economic situation of \nSIDS such as Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nI must emphasize that graduation to a higher \nincome category makes it difficult to access resources \nto sustain our economic, social and environmental \npolicy objectives. Borrowing funds at a high rate on \nthe international market serves only to perpetuate the \nvicious cycle of debt and threatens our sustainable \ndevelopment. That runs contrary to the goals and \nobjectives of the post-2015 development agenda. In \nthat connection, I call on the international community, \nincluding the leading international financial \ninstitutions, to broaden the scope of the assessment of \nSIDS in order to avoid creating scenarios where debt \nsustainability measures undertaken at the national \nlevel are undermined by the policies of international \ninstitutions. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready to work \nwith the international community by contributing its \nideas to the debate in order to ensure a most favourable \noutcome.\n\nMy delegation is convinced that a nation\u2019s wealth \nlies in the health of its people \u2014 its productive sector. \nWe continue to wrestle with the high incidence of \nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) in our country \nand region. We wish to reiterate our call for a strong \nglobal response to combating the high incidence of \nnon-communicable diseases, in particular in developing \ncountries. In our last statement to this very body (see \nA/68/PV.15), our Prime Minister stressed the need for \nthis international body to keep on the front burner a \npractical strategy to address the high incidence of \nNCDs within our region and throughout the world. \nIn that connection, I wish to commend the outgoing \nPresident of the General Assembly, Ambassador John \nAshe, for convening a number of events focusing on \nthat matter of great importance to my delegation.\n\nIt is our hope that the final report on the \ninformal interactive hearings with non-governmental \norganizations, civil-society organizations, the private \n\n\nsector and academia on the prevention and control of \nNCDs, which was held in June 2014, will serve to build \non the outcome of the initiatives resulting from the \nHigh-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases, \nheld in September 2011 during the Assembly\u2019s sixty-\nsixth session, and the work conducted during the \nfollowing session.\n\nMy delegation is indeed pleased to see the inclusion \nof non-communicable diseases in the goals and targets \nfor sustainable development as part of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. We support the goal to ensure \nhealthy lives and promote well-being for all at all \nages. We also support the target to reduce by one third \npremature mortality from non-communicable diseases \nthrough prevention and treatment, and to promote \nmental health and well-being by 2030. We look to \nthe various specialized bodies of this international \nOrganization for guidance and support as we seek to \nmeet the targets and indicators under that and all goals \ndeveloped as part of the post-2015 development agenda. \nWe reiterate the call for the strengthening of the means \nof implementation of the goals and targets and for the \nrevitalization of the global partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nClimate change remains more than an environmental \nconcern for small island developing States such as Saint \nKitts and Nevis. We regard it more as a threat to our \nexistence. The adverse effects of climate change are well \nknown: persistent adverse weather conditions, floods, \nextended droughts and rising sea levels. My delegation \nis convinced of the need to preserve our planet Earth \nfor ourselves and generations yet unborn. We have an \nobligation to combat climate change through mitigation \nand adaptation measures.\n\nClimate change financing and technology transfer \nwill be pivotal to the success of that objective. We \nurge widespread acceptance by the international \ncommunity of creative initiatives such as debt swap \nfor climate adaptation and mitigation. My Government \nis convinced that such proposals, developed with \nassistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat, provide \nSIDS with a greater degree of flexibility as we try to \nachieve sustainable development. We welcome the \ncommitment of the President of the General Assembly \nto provide appropriate impetus and momentum to the \nongoing process under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reach a \nglobal agreement on climate change by 2015.\n\nMaintaining peace and security remains one of \nthe main priorities of the United Nations. That ideal \nis captured in the post-2015 development agenda as \nsustainable development goal 16, to achieve peaceful \nand inclusive societies and the rule of law and to build \neffective and capable institutions. I am pleased to \nreport that at the national level we have implemented \nstrategies that have brought a reduction in violent crime \nand strengthened institutions that sustain peaceful and \ninclusive societies. We are grateful to our development \npartners \u2014 the Governments of the United States of \nAmerica, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada, \nthe European Union, and the Republic of China on \nTaiwan \u2014 for their invaluable assistance in that regard.\n\nThirty-one years ago, our new nation forged a \nstrategic and mutually beneficial relationship with \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan. That relationship \nhas grown by leaps and bounds, and it touches all \nthree dimensions of sustainable development. As \nthe dialogue continues on the implementation of the \npost-2015 development agenda, Saint Kitts and Nevis \nregards itself suitably qualified to speak on the valuable \ncontribution which the Republic of China on Taiwan \ncan make to the international community.\n\nAt the recent SIDS Conference in Samoa, our \nPrime Minister had the privilege to speak of the value \nof the partnership established with the Government \nand private sector of Taiwan in implementing a number \nof projects in renewable energy, specifically the \nestablishment of a solar panel manufacturing plant and \nthe outfitting of Government buildings and street lights \nwith solar panels. The latter project will assist us in \nSaint Kitts and Nevis to achieve the goal of ensuring \naccess to affordable, reliable and modern energy \nservices for all.\n\nFor many years, our Government has called for \nthe international community to allow the Republic \nof China on Taiwan to participate in the work of the \norgans of the United Nations system. That call is by \nno means arbitrary in nature. It has resulted from \nour partnership in numerous development initiatives \nacross the sustainable development spectrum. Saint \nKitts and Nevis is therefore pleased to note that Taiwan \nwas recently invited to attend the Assembly of the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization for the first \ntime since 1971. We are equally pleased to note the \nparticipation of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly \nand to offer our commendation to the Government and \n\n\npeople of Taiwan for sharing their expertise in the fields \nof medicine and civil aviation safety.\n\nAt this juncture, we are convinced that the time \nis right for that spirit of understanding and inclusion \nto extend to the area of the ongoing negotiations \nin the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and the United Nations Environment \nAssembly. My Government is equally convinced that \nthe experiences gained by Taiwan in its strategy for \nbuilding environmental and economic resilience can be \nshared with the international community through the \nUNFCCC.\n\nWhile the international community is focused \non maintaining peace and security, we are pleased to \nunderscore the active role played by the Government \nof the Republic of China on Taiwan in promoting peace \nand security across the Taiwan Strait and for proposing \nthe East China Sea Peace Initiative, thus demonstrating \nits commitment to international peace and security.\n\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis remains \nconcerned by the decades-old unilateral trade embargo \nimposed on Cuba. That relic of the Cold War runs \ncounter to the principles of international law, principles \nwhich undergird the United Nations system. We stand \nby our sister nations in the Caribbean Community and \nthe Group of 77 and China and reiterate our call for \ncreative ways to resolve that perennial issue, which \nadversely affects the tenor of hemispheric relations.\n\nMy delegation recognizes the challenging weeks \nand months ahead as we prepare in earnest to implement \nthe post-2015 development agenda. We offer our fullest \nsupport in that regard. Such support is critical to the \nsuccessful implementation of the development agenda. \nMay we, as an international community, redouble our \nefforts in a manner that will redound to the benefit of \ndeveloped and developing countries alike.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\u201cA world in which people know how to solve \ntheir problems in peace without violence; a world \nof freedom and mutual respect; a world where all \nyoung people can look forward to finding work that \nallows them to live a happy life.\u201d\nThat, in his own words, is the world that a young man \nfrom my country would like to see. His name is Damian \nVogt. He is in this Hall and represents Switzerland\u2019s \nyouth at the United Nations. This week we work here \ntogether to make that world a reality.\nA little more than a year ago, another young person \nstood in this very place and addressed the world. She \nsaid:\n\n(spoke in English)\n\u201cI speak not for myself, but for all girls and \nboys ... Those who have fought for their rights: \ntheir right to live in peace; their right to be treated \nwith dignity; their right to equality of opportunity; \ntheir right to be educated.\u201d\n(spoke in French)\nThe entire world still remembers the words of \nMalala Yousafzai. The entire world still remembers \nher courage. What a difference in the lives that Malala \nand Damian have known. What a difference between \ngoing to school only at the risk of your life and going \nto school as a right \u2014 the right to a better life. And yet, \nMalala and Damian, like millions of other young people \naround the globe, want exactly the same thing: peace, \nhuman dignity, freedom and equality, an education, and \nan opportunity to work. The youth of today have a right \nto expect from all of us, we who represent the nations, \nthat we truly will be united in our commitment to do \neverything within our power to place in their hands \ntomorrow a world where humanity is synonymous with \nsecurity, freedom and prosperity.\n\nIt is a century now since the outbreak of the First \nWorld War, and 75 years since the beginning of the \nSecond World War. The memory of those cataclysmic \nevents imposes a duty on humankind to work towards \ngreater security and freedom, to bring about the \nconditions for prosperity, and to become an Organization \nof genuinely united nations that is effective as a true \nassembly of States at the service of the people. Here \nat the heart of the United Nations, Switzerland wishes \nto do its part by making the following twin objectives \na priority: strengthening international security and \nreforming the United Nations.\n\nThe security challenges are immense. At no time \nsince the Second World War has humankind seen so \nmany people displaced. More than 50 million men, \nwomen and children have been torn from their homes. \nThe story of each and every one of them is a human \ntragedy. Caught up in this current of insecurity are \nalso 75 million young people who, without work, face \na future without prospects. We are talking about one \nyoung person in 10 in the world, and in certain regions \none in two. Worse still, in ever more regions throughout \nthe globe there are waves of instability assailing the rule \nof international law and, in particular the principles of \nhumanitarian law, which are being ignored, violated, \nand swept away in the deluge.\n\nThis is extremely worrisome in the Middle East, \nabove all in Syria and Iraq. Switzerland condemns in \nthe strongest terms the brutal acts of the self-proclaimed \nIslamic State and the groups that have allied themselves \nwith it. Islam can, and must, like other religions, be a \nmessenger of peace, humanity and fraternity. As for the \nnations, they can and must be truly united as a constant \nreminder at all times and in all places of the supremacy \nof law over force.\n\nWhere serious violations occur, investigations must \nbe carried out. Here, the independent commissions of \ninquiry play an essential role, especially that of the \nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry \non the Syrian Arab Republic, to allow for genuine \nreconciliation and lasting peace. Switzerland and 60 \nother States have requested the Security Council to \nrefer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal \nCourt. We have also committed ourselves to an increase \nin our humanitarian aid in the region. The crisis in \nSyria must be dealt with as a whole, and we call on the \nparties to return to the negotiating table and to work \ntowards a political solution.\n\nSwitzerland calls on the Iraqi Government to \nensure accountability. It joins the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights in calling on Iraq to \nconsider accession to the Rome Statute.\n\nWith regard to all forms of extremism that can \nlead to acts of terrorism, it is important also to address \ntheir root causes to show young people that violence \nholds out no promise for the future. The establishment \n\n\nin Geneva of the Global Community Engagement and \nResilience Fund was an important step in this direction.\n\nThe world in 2014 has witnessed a conjunction of \nmany crises \u2014 in the Middle East, in the Maghreb, in \nAfrica, and also in Europe, where war returned this \nyear with the crisis in Ukraine. This situation weakens \nthe security of the entire continent.Violations of the \nHelsinki principles and of international law, whether \nin the form of an illegal annexation of territory, such \nas that of Crimea by Russia, or of military incursions \nin eastern Ukraine, demand a firm response from the \ninternational community. But such a response must also \nbe balanced, leaving room for dialogue and cooperation \nso that open discussion remains possible. To simply \nisolate Russia from the rest of Europe will not solve \nany problems and will only create more, in Europe and \nbeyond. Stability can be restored in Ukraine and in \nEurope if we succeed in resolving this crisis by working \nwith Russia, not against it.\n\nThat stability will be all the more sustainable if the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) \u2014 of which Switzerland this year holds the \nchairmanship \u2014 is able to re-establish a firm basis for \nsecurity cooperation between the Euro-Atlantic and \nEurasian regions. Switzerland, in its capacity as current \nchair of the OSCE, fully supports the vital work of the \ncontact group for Ukraine and Russia. We are currently \ntaking steps to increase funding for the special civil \nmonitoring mission, that will also require additional \nsupport from the participating States, and we welcome \nthe excellent cooperation with the United Nations.\n\nIn today\u2019s unstable world, Switzerland has made \nan active commitment to achieving greater security \nby focusing its efforts there where it can make the \ngreatest contribution \u2014 the prevention of conflicts. \nThe prevention of violence means, first and foremost \nmaking certain that a proper education is available to all \nand that there are opportunities for every young person. \nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s Global Education \nFirst Initiative. Switzerland is working to promote \neducation through massive open online courses and \nseeks to encourage the development of dual vocational \ntraining, combining school studies with on-the-job \napprenticeships. This calls for a joint commitment on \nthe part of the State and the social partners.\n\nIn addition, preventing tensions from arising \nrequires knowing how to give everyone a voice. At the \nheart of Switzerland\u2019s history lies a willingness to share \npower, to engage in direct dialogue with minorities, \nand to distribute authority between central and local \ngovernment \u2014 an emphasis on consultation rather than \non confrontation. In order to better prevent and manage \ntensions in the world, we must strengthen the mediation \ncapacities of both the United Nations and regional \nsecurity organizations, particularly those of the largest \namong them, the OSCE.\n\nSwitzerland has decided to augment its \ncontributions to international development and \nhumanitarian cooperation. In the coming year we will \nbe allocating funds for this purpose amounting to the \nequivalent of 0.5 per cent of our gross national income. \nIn other words, to help the neediest inhabitants of our \nplanet, each person in Switzerland will be contributing \na little over one dollar every day.\n\nThe post-2015 process provides us with the chance \nto transform the world\u2019s challenges into opportunities. \nThere must be a single agenda for universal sustainable \ndevelopment, with shared objectives. We must all act \nto ensure that they are truly achieved. If all nations \nare genuinely united, it lies within our power to \nmake certain that no one in the world need face a \nfuture of destitute poverty. It is within our power to \nmake certain that the creation of jobs and wealth, and \nthus also companies doing business contribute to the \ndevelopment of human rights and help to foster respect \nfor the limited resources of this Earth.\n\nToday there are crises that cannot wait for the \noutcome of discussions on an agenda, no matter how \nsustainable it may be. Switzerland has increased its \nhumanitarian commitment to the fight against the \nhorror of Ebola. Swiss-based research centres, among \nthe best in the world, are working to arrange for the \nclinical testing of vaccines. Similarly, we must also do \nall we can every day to protect the world\u2019s youth from \nthe horrors of war. The place of children and young \npeople is in school and with their families and not on \nthe battlefield. Switzerland is intensifying its efforts to \nprovide better health protection for women, especially \nyoung girls, and has also launched an action plan to \ncombat the phenomenon of child soldiers, who are \nbeing deprived ofthe right to be simply children.\n\nIn order to meet these challenges we will need not \nonly the common will of the United Nations but also an \norganization that functions in an effective, transparent, \nand democratic fashion. \u201cWe the peoples of the United \nNations\u201d are the opening words of the United Nations \nCharter. They are a reminder that the United Nations \nmust first listen to and serve the people of this world. \n\n\n\nIn concrete terms, this means that it must strengthen \nbodies that are dedicated to the prevention of conflicts. \nSwitzerland applauds the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to strengthen the commitment of the United \nNations to human rights, particularly in sensitive \nregions. My country has launched an appeal for the \nallocation of additional funds for those important \nactivities.\n\nThere is also a need to strengthen the United Nations \nspecial political missions to prevent conflicts and \nreinforce the activity of the Peacebuilding Commission. \nThe United Nations must devote all its energy to its \nwork in the field to serve the people. It must avoid \ngetting lost in an administrative maze. Together with \neight other countries, Switzerland has commissioned \na group of experts to draft recommendations for the \nreform of planning and budgeting processes.\n\nLastly, the ability of the United Nations to be \neffective in dealing with the challenges it faces depends \non the legitimacy it enjoys as well as its ability to be \ntransparent and inclusive in the Security Council. The \npermanent members ought not to use their veto to block \naction designed to prevent or put an end to genocide, \ncrimes against humanity, or war crimes. Switzerland \nwelcomes the French initiative for a voluntary \nagreement by the five permanent members to restrain \ntheir veto power in cases of mass atrocities.\n\nOne day, many years ago, a young man travelling \nacross the north of Italy was horrified by the suffering \nhe witnessed on the battlefield at Solferino in the 1800s. \nThe young man\u2019s name was Henri Dunant. With the \nhelp of local women, he cared for the wounded soldiers. \nLater, when he returned home to Geneva, he dedicated \nhimself to raising public awareness of the tragedy that \nhad taken place. Through his commitment, the Red Cross \nMovement was born. Through his persistence, the first \nGeneva Convention was signed, 150 years ago in 1864. \nThis document \u2014 which I am holding up here and will \ngive to the President of the General Assembly \u2014 is a \nreproduction of the original, in which States committed \nthemselves to providing assistance to wounded soldiers \nand ensuring respect for humanitarian principles. Thus, \ninternational humanitarian law was born.\n\nYet today, 150 years later, humanitarian law is \ntoo often violated or ignored. Switzerland and the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross were \ngiven a mandate to consult States and to issue \nrecommendations. We will present next year a specific \nproposal to strengthen respect for humanitarian \nlaw and to put in place some joint machinery and an \ninstitutional framework. For the past 150 years, the \nspirit of Geneva, the spirit of international law, has \nshone forth throughout the world like a beacon, a place \nof peace, a home to humanitarianism and a refuge for \nhumankind. Geneva is a gift, both for Switzerland and \nfor the world, and we would like to strengthen its role \nfurther by finding useful solutions for humankind. Like \nMalala and Damian, Henri Dunant dreamed of peace, \nfreedom and prosperity for the world. His story \u2014 the \nstory of the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions \u2014 is \na message of commitment. The action of each one of us \ncan make a difference.\n\nIn a few days, Switzerland will rename one of the \nhighest mountain peaks in the Alps. It will henceforth \nbe known as Dunant Peak, after Henri Dunant, the \nfirst recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Here, where \nthe nations come together, we have the power to \nmove mountains, as long as we stand united, working \ntogether to make the dreams of Damian and Malala and \nall young people in the world a reality. We owe them \na better world. We are capable of building that world \ntogether, if we find the will to work as nations truly \nunited in dialogue and action \u2014 united nations, whose \nGovernments draw their strength from the people, for \nthe people; united nations who draw their inspiration \nfrom the youth for the youth.\n"

        "file_text": "We live in a globalized world that is moving towards \nmultipolarity in an age characterized by the threat to \nthe survival of the human species. The United States \nGovernment and NATO will not be able to reverse that \ntrend with a new world division through the force of \narms. However, there is a serious risk that in trying to \ndo so, they render the world ungovernable.\n\nThe huge nuclear and conventional arsenals \nthat have been built up, the imposed annual military \nexpenditure that amounts to $1.75 trillion and the \nincrease in military budgets to 2 per cent of the gross \ndomestic product required of all States members of \nNATO will not help to address or to resolve issues such \nas poverty, hunger, epidemics or waves of migration or \nto overcome the global economic, environmental. food, \nenergy and water crises.\n\nAs has already been demonstrated, wherever the \nso-called unconventional warfare described in the 2010 \nUnited States Special Forces Army Training Circular \n18-01 and the innovations of the 2010 United States \nQuadrennial Defense Review are practised, chaos \nensues through the destabilization or destruction \nof States, the proliferation of violent and extremist \ngroups and the tearing apart of nations, cultures and \nreligions, thereby seriously jeopardizing regional and \ninternational peace and security. It is necessary to \ncondemn the militarization of cyberspace and the illegal \nand covert interference in the information systems \nof some countries in order to use them in aggressive \nactions against third countries to stir up conflict, as \nwell as global espionage on Governments and entire \nsocieties.\n\nThe extraterritorial application of United States \nlaws to the detriment of other sovereign nations is \nbecoming increasingly aggressive and encourages \nthe use of unilateral sanctions, in particular financial \nsanctions, as a tool of foreign policy. The use of its \ncourts of justice to impose multimillion-dollar fines, \nincluding on its allies, under decisions that violate \ninternational law, has become a means of punishment \nand threat and a way to spuriously obtain financial \nresources. Governments, by failing to defend their own \nsovereignty and to apply their own laws so as to protect \nthe standards of the international financial system and \n\nthe legitimate interests of their nations and those of their \ncompanies and citizens, are creating the conditions \nnecessary for the proliferation of such practices, which \njeopardize the independence of all States and the rule \nof international law.\n\nMedia empires, increasingly linked to the \nhegemonic goals of the Western Powers, continue their \nmisinformation campaigns, shamelessly and cynically \nmanipulate facts and create public opinion matrices \nthat promote aggression. We need another international \norder, where there is no room for the philosophy of war \nand the plundering of natural resources.\n\nThe foreign intervention in Syria must stop. It is \ninconceivable that Western Powers encourage, finance \nand arm terrorist groups to set them against a State, \nwhile trying to combat their crimes in another State, as \nis now happening in Iraq. The United States Government \nviolates international law when it launches, in contempt \nof the United Nations, unilateral bombings without \nrespect for sovereign borders or States under the guise \nof dubious coalitions.\n\nThe attempt to deploy NATO up to Russia\u2019s borders \nwill have serious consequences for international peace \nand security and for the stability of Europe. The \nsanctions against Russia are immoral and unjust. The \nstrategic American deployment in the Asia-Pacific \nregion will create dangers for the sovereignty of all \nnations in the area.\n\nIsrael\u2019s crimes against the Palestinian people, \nmost recently in the Gaza Strip, should not remain \nunpunished under the protection of a veto in the \nSecurity Council. Palestine should already be a State \nMember of the United Nations, established within the \n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nThe General Assembly must exercise the \nprerogatives conferred on it by the Charter of the \nUnited Nations in the current dangerous and unstable \ninternational situation, which is full of threats and \nchallenges. The Security Council should be rebuilt \non the basis of democracy, transparency and the fair \nrepresentation of the countries of the South, which are \ndiscriminated against, as permanent and non-permanent \nmembers. It should be built on credibility and strict \nobservance of the Charter, without double standards, \nobscure procedures or the anachronistic veto. The \nOrganization needs profound reform and the defence \nof its principles. The Secretary-General should be the \ndefender and guarantor of international peace.\n\nThe 1.2 billion people who live in extreme poverty, \nthe 842 million people who suffer chronic hunger, \nthe 774 million illiterate adults and the 57 million \nuneducated children affirm that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals \u2014 which are questionable from \na methodological point of view \u2014 were a mirage. \nThere has been and still is a lack of political will in \nthe Governments of industrialized States, where \nblindness and ineffective selfishness prevail. Insatiable \ntransnational businesses increasingly focus on the \nownership of huge resources. The unequal distribution \nof wealth is increasingly ruthless.\n\nIt is necessary, inevitably, to establish a new \ninternational economic order. In these circumstances, \nthe discussions on the post-2015 development agenda \ngive us little reason to hope. However, we must try \nto reach agreement, as that is the most urgent task. It \nmust be the result of an inclusive intergovernmental \nnegotiation. The resulting document should not be the \ninterpretation of a few parties to the consensus, but \nrather of the consensus itself.\n\nIt is urgent to make sub-Saharan Africa a priority. \nIt is essential to confront jointly and decisively, with \nsufficient and genuine cooperation, the Ebola epidemic \nthat is affecting some countries of the continent. Cuba \nhas decided to maintain its medical cooperation in the \n32 African countries where more than 4,000 specialists \nare working and is willing to extend its cooperation, \nunder the auspices of the World Health Organization \n(WHO), to other, most affected countries, as has been \nreported. Our doctors and paramedics will do so \ncompletely voluntarily.\n\nWe call on the international community, particularly \nindustrialized countries with substantial means, to \nforcefully respond to the call of the United Nations \nand WHO to supply financial, health and scientific \nresources right away in order to eradicate the scourge \nand prevent it from claiming more lives. The necessary \nresources should also be contributed to support the \nAfrican Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, which sets forth the road \nmap for the development of the region.\n\nIn the past five decades, 325,000 Cuban health \nworkers have assisted 158 nations of the South, including \n39 African countries, where 76,000 have worked. Also, \n38,000 physicians were trained free of charge in 121 \ncountries; of those, 3,392 were in 45 African nations. \nIf Cuba, small and subject to a blockade, has been able \nto do that, how much more could have been done for \n\nAfrica with the cooperation of all, especially of the \nrichest States?\n\nAt the second Summit of the Community of \nLatin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), in \nHavana, we agreed on what is needed to achieve the \ngoal of making societies more just and inclusive. It \nis indispensable that there be a better distribution of \nwealth and income, the eradication of illiteracy, quality \neducation for all, real food security, health systems \nwith universal coverage, and the fulfilment of other \nhuman rights.\n\nThe solemn Proclamation of Latin America and \nthe Caribbean as a zone of peace, signed by the Heads \nof State and Government, enshrines respect for the \nprinciples and norms of international law, the promotion \nof a culture of peace, nuclear disarmament and general \nand complete disarmament, and the inalienable right of \nevery State to choose its political, economic and social \nsystem. We also undertook to make Latin America \nand the Caribbean a region free from colonialism and \nexpressed support for the inalienable right of the people \nof Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence.\n\nThe Havana summit recognized that the current \neconomic, financial and environmental crises have \ndelivered particularly harsh blows to small island \ndeveloping States, including the nations of the \nCaribbean. Their efforts to improve the welfare of \ntheir populations should not be punished by calling \nthem middle-income countries through schematic \ncalculations of per capita income, without taking into \naccount their specificities and vulnerabilities.\n\nIn CELAC, the region of Latin America and the \nCaribbean has found a native and legitimate space \nto forge from its rich diversity the essential unity to \nfulfil the dreams of our heroes, achieve the complete \nindependence of \u201cOur America\u201d and make a substantial \ncontribution to creating balance in the world. In that \neffort, there have been significant developments \u2014 the \nmeeting between the Union of South American Nations \nand Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and \nSouth Africa (BRICS); the meeting between the \nleaders of China and the countries of Latin America \nand the Caribbean; and the establishment of the China-\nCELAC Forum in Brasilia in July, as had been agreed \nin Havana. We welcome the Fortaleza Declaration, \nalso adopted in July in Brazil, at the sixth summit of \nthe BRICS countries \u2014 whose economies account for \n25 per cent of world gross domestic product and almost \n40 per cent of the population of the planet \u2014 as well \nas the setting up of a development bank and a foreign \nexchange reserves common fund, which are important \nfor the countries of the South and for the construction \nof a new international financial architecture.\n\nWe express our solidarity with the Bolivarian \nand Chavista revolution, which, under the leadership \nof President Nicolas Maduro, is battling to fend off \ndestabilizing actions and foreign interference. We \nsupport the worthy fight being waged by Argentina \nagainst speculative capital funds, and we oppose the \ninterventionist decisions of the United States courts \nthat are violating international law. In addition, we \nreiterate our strong support for the legitimate rights \nof Argentina with respect to the Malvinas Islands. We \nalso reiterate our unwavering support for the fight that \nEcuador is leading against the ecological pillaging \nand damage caused by the activities of transnational \ncompanies.\n\nOn the eve of the International Decade for People \nof African Descent (2015-2024), we would recall that \nthis year we celebrate the 210th anniversary of the \nindependence of Haiti, whose anti-slavery and pro-\nindependence revolution was the precursor of liberation \nmovements in Latin America and the Caribbean. Haiti \ndeserves special contributions for its reconstruction \nand development, under the sovereign leadership of its \nGovernment, in which we encourage the international \ncommunity to participate. We support the claim of the \nCaribbean to receive reparations from the colonial \nPowers for the horrors of slavery.\n\nThe State Department has again put Cuba on \nits unilateral and arbitrary list of State sponsors of \ninternational terrorism. Its real purpose is to increase \nscrutiny of our international financial transactions \nworldwide and justify the policy of blockade. During \nthe current Administration, there has been a tightening \nof the extraterritorial dimension of the blockade, with \na strong and unprecedented emphasis in the financial \nrealm, through the imposition of huge fines on banking \ninstitutions in third-party countries. An example of this \nis the scandalous and unjust mega-fine imposed on the \nFrench bank BNP Paribas. Furthermore, the current \nAdministration has not stepped back from promoting \ndestabilization in Cuba. It allocates millions of dollars \nto that end in its budget every year and increasingly \nrelies on undercover methods, such as the use of \ninformation and communications technology. The \nZunZuneo project, sponsored by the United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID), which \n\nnot only violates Cuban law but also the law of its own \ncountry, is the latest evidence of that.\n\nRecent disclosures about the use of young people \nfrom our continent in subversive actions in Cuba, \na project funded and executed by USAID, confirm \nthat the Cuban Government is right in its countless \ndenunciations of the ongoing illegal plans of the \nUnited States to subvert Cuba\u2019s internal order, in \nviolation of Cuban sovereignty, the sovereignty of \nthird countries and international law. We cannot fail \nto remember that this month marks the sixteenth year \nof the unjust imprisonment of three Cubans from the \nCuban Five \u2014 Gerardo, Ram\u00f3n and Antonio \u2014 who \nwith the utmost altruism confronted the terrorist plans \norganized within United States territory against our \ncountry. I therefore reiterate, on behalf of the people \nand Government of Cuba, that we will not cease in our \nefforts to call for their return to their homeland.\n\nCuba, for its part, remains calm and prepared for \nmutually respectful and responsible dialogue, based \non reciprocity, with the United States Government. \nAt the same time, Cuba continues to make progress \nin the updating of its socioeconomic model, despite \nadverse international circumstances marked by a global \neconomic crisis and the tightening of the blockade.\n\n\nUpdating Cuban\u2019s economic socialist model is \naimed at ensuring well-being, equity and social justice \nfor all Cubans. The changes that we are introducing \nare also geared to preserving the achievements of the \nRevolution, which so many generations have fought for. \nThe goal is to build an ever more just, prosperous and \nsustainable Cuban socialism."

        "file_text": "At the outset, Mr. President, \nI would like to warmly congratulate you, my brother, \non your assumption of the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session, with its theme of \n\u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative post-\n2015 development agenda\u201d, which is both timely and \nappropriate. I would also like to take this opportunity \nto express my deep appreciation to your predecessor, \nAmbassador John Ashe, for a job well done.\n\nNext year, 2015, marks the seventieth anniversary of \nthe birth of the United Nations. The world has changed \nalmost beyond recognition since 1945. Originally \nfounded by 50 Members, the United Nations has seen \nthree times that many nations join it in the intervening \nyears. The demographic, economic, political and cultural \nrealities of its Member States bear little resemblance to \nthose of the past. The challenges of the time and the \ndemands of the age are vastly different from those of \nthe period following the Second World War, or even \nthe past few decades. Change, rapid transformative \nchange, is the order of the day. And yet the United \nNations, the Organization that ostensibly represents \nthe entire community of nations and the peoples of the \nworld, remains stuck in the past. It is still thoroughly \ndominated by a few countries and has marginalized the \noverwhelming majority. Its institutions and structures \nare an anachronism in the modern world.\n\nMore crucially, the United Nations has fallen \nfar short of playing the primary role in pursuing the \nfundamental objectives for which it was established. \nThe maintenance of global peace and security was and \nremains one of its cardinal goals, and yet conflicts and \nwars \u2014 even simultaneous and multiple wars \u2014 have \nbecome a constant feature of our lives. Many of them \n\n\nare waged in total disregard for the United Nations and \nits mandate. In Africa \u2014 from the East to the West \nand in the North \u2014 in the Middle East and on every \nother continent, extremism, terrorism and all forms of \nbigotry and intolerance are spreading. The record on \nother key principles and aspirations is also far from \nsatisfactory, whether the issue is ending poverty, \nensuring sustainable development, advancing human \nrights, preventing epidemics, respecting sovereignty \nand non-interference in the affairs of others, ensuring \njustice and equality or protecting the environment. \nThe world is unquestionably facing a very grave \nand dangerous situation. To paraphrase the words \nof the Secretary-General, this is a terrible time \u201cfor \nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations\u201d (A/69/PV.6, p. 1).\n\nIn order to restore the relevance and credibility \nof the United Nations \u2014 to turn it into a truly \nrepresentative institution of all nations and peoples, \nwhere all nations, no matter how big or small, have \nrespect for its Charter and for international law, and \nwhere all nations contribute, each according to its \ncapabilities, to peace and security and to the welfare \nof people and the planet \u2014 it is imperative that we \nfundamentally restructure, democratize and rebuild the \nUnited Nations. The crucial and pressing need for that \nhas been clear for several decades now, starting in the \nheight of the Cold War and continuing through the past \n25 years, during which time the world has lived through \nan unsuccessful attempt to impose a unipolar world. \nConsequently, United Nations reform has formally been \non the agenda for close to two decades. No country has \nopenly disputed the importance of restructuring the \nUnited Nations, and many workable proposals have \nbeen presented and thoroughly discussed. Yet we are no \nnearer to change, because of the stubborn and cynical \nopposition of the dominant Powers.\n\nGiven the determination of those Powers to \nmaintain their control of the United Nations and its \nunrepresentative and undemocratic character, the \nchances of genuine change in the next few years are \nindeed slender. It is therefore vital that all nations and \npeoples \u2014 as well as the political and social forces \nthat stand for peace, independence, international law, \njustice, equity and sustainable development \u2014 forge \na common front. They must consolidate partnerships \nand coordinate their efforts on the basis of a broad \ncommon strategy to stem the threats we face and to \nbuild a better and more equitable world, while at the \nsame time containing without let-up the campaign to \nrestructure the United Nations, eradicate poverty, \nprevent conflicts, address global warming and fight all \nforms of terrorism and extremism.\n\nEritrea\u2019s perspective on the need for an overhaul of \nthe United Nations system is informed not only by the \nshared experience of the majority of nations, but also \nby its own history. The international system and the \ndominant Powers have dealt the Eritrean people a raw \ndeal. First, they were denied the right to decolonization \nand independence to satisfy what the then United \nStates Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in 1952 \nstated were in \u201cthe strategic interests of the United \nStates in the Red Sea basin\u201d. When the Eritrean people \nembarked on a 30-year armed struggle for national \nliberation and independence in order to advance their \ngeopolitical interests in the Horn of Africa and the \nRed Sea region, the super-Powers supplied arms and \nadvisers to their client States to crush Eritrea\u2019s right \nto self-determination, and the United Nations ignored \ntheir plight. Even after achieving independence at a \ntremendous human and material cost and joining the \ncommunity of nations, the Eritrean people are still \nvictimized. The United Nations once again has failed to \nuphold an internationally endorsed, final and binding \narbitration of the border decision. In fact, to add insult \nto injury, it has imposed unjust sanctions on their \ncountry.\n\nThat travesty of justice has caused harm not only \nto Eritrea but to the entire Horn of Africa, which is \nnow mired in endemic conflicts and instability. Once \nagain and from this rostrum, Eritrea calls on the \nUnited Nations and the Security Council to redress that \ninjustice by taking concrete measures to end the illegal \noccupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. The unjust \nand unfair sanctions, for which everyone now agrees \nthat there was and continues to be no justification, must \nalso unconditionally and immediately be lifted. Such \nlong-overdue measures would contribute positively to \nthe tireless efforts of the Eritrean people to build their \nnation, maintain peace, stability and harmony, improve \ntheir livelihood, lay the foundations of a strong, \nequitable national economy, create opportunities \nfor youth and women, and advance regional and \ninternational engagement and cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "I am \nproud to represent a small but great nation, El Salvador, \nbefore the Assembly. Our history has been full of \npainful moments, but also times of hope and courage. \nFor years, we struggled to achieve democracy. We \nmarked a historic global milestone when we became \nthe first country in the region to end a painful civil war \nthrough dialogue and reconciliation in order to begin to \nbuild a democratic country.\n\nLike most developing countries, we face the familiar \nchallenges of reducing poverty and social inequalities \nand building the conditions needed for families to \nhave healthier and safer lives. Experience has shown \nus that it is only through solidarity, respect, inclusion \nand equity that we can overcome those challenges. In \nrecent years, we have made significant strides in human \ndevelopment. In rural areas, we have reduced extreme \npoverty to 13.6 per cent; we have allocated 14.8 per cent \nof our gross domestic product to social spending; and \nwe have raised primary education coverage to 93.7 per \ncent and reduced illiteracy by a little over 5 percentage \npoints. We have achieved an important reduction in \nmaternal mortality, and we have improved sanitation \nservices and access to drinking water for the population.\n\nWe have witnessed significant changes, and just \nas we did 14 years ago at the Millennium Summit, we \nare working on the parameters that will lead us to a \nmore just and equitable world. However, our debt to \nhumankind remains. We continue working to create \nfactors that can enhance our human development and \nprovide stronger social protection, which will allow us \nto ensure universal access to basic social services on a \nsustainable basis.\n\nWe are one year away from the most important \nworld summit in our history, where we will evaluate \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in \nparticular the goals that have been achieved, and \nwhere we will define the new post-2015 development \nagenda, based on a new comprehensive, transformative \nand inclusive development paradigm. We believe in \na vision for development that meets the needs of our \npeoples, in which all human beings have a full and \ndignified life, living in democracy and enjoying the \nright to sovereignty and determination and the right to \nchoose our path towards peace and development. The \nnew agenda must integrate universal issues, such as \nmigration, climate change, food security, education, \nhealth, public safety and world peace. We must not keep \nrepeating the errors of the past. Based on the experience \nof the MDGs, we must reduce the inequality gaps and \nthe structural causes of poverty and exclusion.\n\nThe new global agenda requires us to come to an \nagreement on how to face the great threat of climate \nchange, which afflicts us with hardships and limits the \nopportunities for families to live with dignity. The next \nfew months are key for the establishment of a road map \nto implement the parameters of the new development \nparadigm. We must work together, using an approach \nbased on shared but differentiated responsibilities.\n\nIt is urgent to amend the existing financial \narchitecture and international cooperation mechanisms \nso that they meet the needs of our peoples with \neffective institutions and transparent mechanisms. \nWe must renew the terms under which development \nassistance is granted, review its amounts and ensure \nthe implementation of procedures that facilitate \nthe principles of sustainable development. The new \ndevelopment indicators should make exclusion and \ninequality visible. To that end, measurements must focus \non whether needs are met and opportunities provided. \nThe objectives and goals should address personal \nfulfilment and our right to the pursuit of happiness as \nmuch as the economic growth of countries.\n\nI call upon the United Nations to maintain its \nresources and programmes in Latin America, and \nin particular in Central America, regardless of the \nmacroeconomic classification of our countries. To \nreduce the United Nations presence would only \nexacerbate the serious economic and social inequality \nproblems suffered by the region.\n\n\nFinancing for development is vital for the \nimplementation of the sustainable development goals \nand the post-2015 development agenda. I reaffirm the \nresolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the \nCentral American Integration System (SICA), which \nstresses that financing for development should be based \non the priorities of the countries concerned, making use \nof innovative financing mechanisms. We must explore \nnew sources, such as the resources found in offshore \nareas, a global asset to which only a handful of countries \nnow have access. El Salvador expresses its commitment \nto the new global alliance for development, based on \nthe Monterrey Consensus, the Doha Declaration on \nFinancing for Development and the outcome document \nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (resolution 66/288, annex).\n\nMuch work still lies ahead. However, countries will \nnot be able to accomplish that work unilaterally, but \nshould rather take action within the framework of the \nUnited Nations. We must also unite to advance the reform \nprocess of the United Nations, especially since we need \na strengthened and renewed Organization. We need a \nGeneral Assembly, the main forum for global debate, \nwith an agenda focused on the most pressing issues of \nthe international community, and a Security Council \nopen to increased representation and participation \nby all Member States. We call for the strong support \nand political will of all Member States, so that we can \nhave an Organization that can provide timely support \nin the face of the new challenges posed by history. In \nthe context of those global challenges, our Government \nreaffirms its call for a comprehensive and inclusive \ndevelopment agenda for social peace, capacity-building \nand consensus-building across sectors.\n\nIn recent years, my country has launched a \ntransformation process that focuses on sustainable \ndevelopment, the fight against poverty and the \nreduction of inequality, exclusion and social injustice, \nand that promotes an equality agenda with a focus on \ngender and human rights. In our country, the Universal \nSocial Protection System Law is an invaluable tool that \nintegrates for the first time a network of social policies \nand strategies that provides basic services to people, is \nfocused on the most vulnerable population groups and \nis designed to address the main challenges we face.\n\nEl Salvador makes every effort to improve the quality \nof life of the population and to build the conditions that \nwill help us to strengthen family unity, values and create \nopportunities for new generations and raise awareness \nabout the risks of irregular migration, especially to the \nUnited States. I call upon the international community \nto support us in overcoming the situation generated \nby the increased flow of unaccompanied migrant \nchildren travelling to the United States. The United \nNations system, including the General Assembly, \nmust play a greater role in addressing the migration \nissue and recognize that human mobility is a relevant \nfactor in the Organization\u2019s work and include it in the \nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nAs we address that phenomenon, which has many \ncauses, we are convinced that we must act with a \ncomprehensive approach that provides protection \nfor the rights of our children, ensures respect for \nthe due process of law and provides support for the \nreunification of children with their parents. We must \nwork with the communities of origin of the migrant \npopulation to create better conditions and increase the \ninvestment in education, health, safety and jobs \u2014 all \nfrom a perspective of joint responsibility among the \ncountries of origin, transit and destination.\n\nThreats to public safety represent another major \nchallenge faced by our country and others in the region \nand throughout the world. We will not rest until we \nensure the necessary conditions for Salvadorans to live \nsafely and in peace. The various sectors of our society \nare responding to the call of our Government, and we \nhope that the international community will strengthen \nits support for the titanic struggle that El Salvador and \nCentral America are waging against violence in all its \ndifferent forms.\n\nWe observe with concern the many conflicts and \nthreats to international peace and security. We deeply \nregret the loss of lives, particularly of children, as \na result of the indiscriminate attacks in Gaza. We \nwelcome the peace plan presented by Egypt, and we \nurge the parties involved to endeavour to ensure a firm \nand lasting peace that achieves the coexistence of two \nStates, Israel and Palestine, within secure borders.\n\nWe are concerned about the recent attacks and \nhuman rights violations committed by the self-\nproclaimed Islamic State against the defenceless civilian \npopulation. We call on the international community to \nclose ranks in United Nations bodies so as to put an end \nto those brutal acts. Only the coordinated action of our \nmultilateral system can achieve the results to which we \nall aspire.\n\n\nWe will always be committed to peace. All citizens \nof the world must become peacemakers, as Saint \nJohn Paul II himself said during one of his visits to \nEl Salvador. El Salvador, as a beneficiary of United \nNations support during our historic peace process, \ncannot fail to strengthen its commitment to support \npeacekeeping operations around the world. As a \ncountry, we are providing support through our prompt \ncontribution to the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, and we are \nstanding with the Haitian people in their recovery \nprocess, as part of a joint effort of the United Nations \nsystem, which cannot be neglected.\n\nI wish to stress that human rights is one of the \npriority working areas of our foreign policy. In that \ncontext, El Salvador has presented its candidacy to the \nHuman Rights Council, which will hold elections at \nthis session of the General Assembly. Our candidacy \nrepresents an opportunity for us to continue to fulfil \nour international commitments and to demonstrate the \nimportance of living under the rule of law in harmony \nwith our environment.\n\nIn our efforts in pursuit of peace and inclusive and \nequitable development, there is no place for contempt \nfor fundamental principles and freedoms. I refer here \nto the economic, trade and financial blockade against \nthe sister Republic of Cuba, which, in spite of that \nunilateral action against its people, has overcome the \nobstacles and adversity imposed on it with exemplary \nperseverance and determination. Consequently, \nEl Salvador calls for an end to the blockade. We believe \nthat the inclusion of Cuba in the list of States sponsors \nof international terrorism is unfounded. Cuba must be \nremoved from that mechanism, whose sole purpose is \nto justify the blockade.\n\nI want to highlight the contribution to multilateralism \nmade by the countries of Central and Latin America \nand their regional organizations. Let me mention in \nparticular the Central American Integration System, \nwhere we have be able to set out a multidimensional \nregional agenda that guides our regional work through \nfive main pillars: economic integration, social \nintegration and the fight against poverty, comprehensive \ndisaster management and the adaptation to climate \nchange, institutional strengthening and democratic \nsecurity.\n\nThe Central and Latin American region needs \ninternational support for the Central American \nSecurity Strategy, which will allow our Governments \nto complement national efforts and have a greater \nimpact on regional security. I reiterate the call for the \ninternational community to give its full support to the \nStrategy. The activities of regional bodies, such as SICA \nand the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \nStates, are fundamental and are aimed at strengthening \nsolidarity and cooperation among all peoples of the \nworld.\n\nAs I have stated, we are witnessing an \nunprecedented process of change in the world, which \nbrings with it both opportunities and challenges. If we \nare to succeed, we must unite and integrate our peoples \nand Governments in a global community \u2014 committed \nto the values of democracy, peace, equality, progress \nand development. I conclude by stating that, within \nour modest possibilities, we are ready to meet that \nchallenge.\n"

        "file_text": "Thanks be to the almighty \nAllah for giving me another opportunity to address \nthis global body at a time when human civilization is \nteetering on the brink of a major catastrophe. Before \ngoing further, let me convey our warm felicitations \nto you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. While \nwishing you success, I would like to assure you of the \nsupport and cooperation of the Gambia during your \ntenure as President of the Assembly. I would also like \nto commend your predecessor, Mr. John William Ashe, \nfor his able stewardship as President of the General \nAssembly.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that injustice, iniquities, \nexclusion and greed all contribute to the creation of \ninternational tensions that can lead to catastrophic \nconsequences, conflicts, wars, death and destruction. \nToday we witness lamentable inertia on the part of \nthe United Nations, as powerful Member States take \nundue advantage of weaker Members; unjust economic \nand financial sanctions are imposed on other Member \nStates; others are bullied and their natural resources \nlooted; or wars are waged against still others, simply \nin the name of democracy, freedom and regime change. \nAll of those actions are based on false pretences.\n\nThat is not the scenario that the noble and \ndistinguished gentlemen, the founders of the United \nNations and its Charter, envisaged. What those great \nfounding fathers of the United Nations intended over \nhalf a century ago was a world body committed to \npromoting the principles and ideals of peace and security \nand advancing the causes of justice and equality; \nfreedom for all; and respect for the sovereignty and \nthe territorial integrity of States, rich or poor, black or \nwhite, big or small; and respect for the social, spiritual, \nreligious and cultural values of all peoples. Therefore, \nin order to uphold the founding principles of the Charter \nof the United Nations, Member States must avoid the \npromotion of all forms of aggression, confrontation \nand dangerous tension by exercising maximal restraint \nin the pursuit of their individual or collective national \ninterests at the expense of others. In fact, the pursuit of \none\u2019s interest at the expense of the legitimate interests \nand security of others is criminal.\n\nInvariably, when major tensions erupt into conflicts \nor wars, the world economy as a whole suffers, with \nmajor disruptions or reversals in the developing \ncountries. That has been evident in the wake of past \n\n\nregional or international conflicts, when oil prices, for \nexample, surged, with the developing countries bearing \nthe brunt of the debilitating consequences. In short, the \nUnited Nations must be seen not as a prejudicial but \nrather as an all-embracing global body that stands for \nthe interests of not only the few and the powerful but all \nits Member States.\n\nThe Gambia acknowledges with satisfaction the \noutcome document of the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development, entitled \u201cThe future we \nwant\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex), and the resulting \nestablishment of the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and associated consultative \nforums, including the African regional consultations \non the sustainable development goals. While the \nGambia appreciates the proposals of the Open Working \nGroup on the post-2015 development framework, it is \nhoped that the goals and targets outlined thus far will \nreflect an integrated and transformative agenda that \nwould ultimately build upon the gains made from the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) in order to fully address the many difficult \nchallenges that we face today.\n\nIt is in that connection that we welcome the choice \nof the theme for this session, namely, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d. That theme is indeed pertinent and timely, as \nit gives fresh impetus to our ardent desire to identify \na set of global priorities to steer the international \ndevelopment agenda, once the MDGs expire at the \nend of 2015. However, in launching that new initiative \nfor transformative change, we must not allow novelty \nto mask any shortcomings of the MDGs experiment. \nThere is a need to take stock of the achievements and \nfailures of those Goals and indeed to renew support \nto those developing countries, particularly the least \ndeveloped, landlocked and island developing countries, \nthat may still have difficulties in meeting their critical \nMDG targets before the end of 2015.\n\nAt a time when the world is facing multiple and \ncomplex challenges, there is a need to pay attention to \nthe commanding role that the United Nations should be \nplaying in advancing international peace and security, \njustice and the fundamental rights and freedoms of all \npeoples. The attainment of the post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment goals will be elusive, unless the United \nNations begins to execute its core mandate in earnest \nand exercises its commanding role in dealing with the \nhost of local and international crises that are disruptive \nto development. A few current issues stand out on which \nthe United Nations has yet to be seen to be playing a \nleading role.\n\nFirst, there is Ebola, a deadly haemorrhagic \nfever that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in West \nAfrica, mostly in the severely affected countries of \nthe Republics of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. \nThe World Health Organization has warned that, if no \nmajor efforts are made immediately, more lives will be \nlost and the economies of those countries will come \nunder serious strain. Already, the World Bank and \nthe International Monetary Fund have projected that, \nowing to disruptions in the labour force and productive \nsectors of the economies of those countries, declines \nin their respective economic growths could range \nfrom 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points, if current conditions \nremain unchecked.\n\nFor those affected countries, all development \nefforts are now on hold as they grapple with that \ncontagious and deadly disease. It is encouraging that \nthe United States Government has committed, rather \nbelatedly, some funds and military assets to curb the \nspread of that disease. That gesture is more than just \nhumanitarian aid. It is also, as President Obama said, \nin the national security interest of the United States. \nThat is true because in a globalized, interconnected \nworld, infectious diseases can easily spread to any part \nof the world. It is for that reason that the United Nations \nshould take the lead in mobilizing international support \nto fight Ebola, which is an evident danger not only to \nWest Africa but to the world at large. On that note, we \nwant to thank the Russian Federation for being one of \nthe first major Powers to respond to the outbreak of \ndeadly Ebola by providing scientific and medical teams \nto some of those countries as soon as the outbreak was \nannounced.\n\nSecondly, for some time now, the world has been \nwitnessing the bloodiest and most heinous form of \nterrorism, unleashed by satanic and sadistic human \nvermin disguised as Islamic militants, who are acting \nostensibly in the name of Islamic purity. In reality, \nthose sons of infamy and their shameless and deceitful \nclaims of devotion to the peaceful and noble religion of \nIslam are, in fact, an insult not only to all true Muslims, \nbut to our Prophet and humankind in general.\n\nBefore the emergence of the mujahideen in Iran and \nlater in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which was a movement \nsubsequently associated with Islamic terrorism by \nthe Western mainstream media in total disregard for \n\n\nits creation and sponsorship by the Western Powers \nto fight proxy wars against the Islamic revolution in \nIran and the Soviets in Afghanistan, there existed no \nIslamic terrorism. Islam in its entire history has never \nbeen associated with violence or terrorism, as those \nactivities are haram, or forbidden, for a Muslim. Islam \nis a religion of peace and tolerance and has nothing to \ndo with the activities of those anti-Islamic bands of \ndangerous criminals, who spread nothing but deep-\nseated hatred for human life and whose sole intention is \nto desecrate and defame Islam.\n\nConsequently, those various treacherous hate \ngroups cannot be associated with Islam, as our Islamic \nreligion is pure and unique and cannot therefore be \nclassified into varying degrees such as moderate Islam, \ndemocratic Islam, extreme Islam or violent Islam. \nSimply put, Islam is a pure religion that encourages \nthe best of human behaviour and interpersonal \nrelationships, among other virtues, as prescribed \nby Allah, the almighty creator. In other words, the \nadherents of those lunatic fringe groups of bandits \nand gangsters, such as Boko Haram, the Islamic State \nin Syria and Al-Qaida, are dangerous criminals and \nenemies of human civilization and development and \nshould therefore be wiped off the face of the Earth, \nbecause we do not need them.\n\nThirdly, the situation in the Middle East remains \nhighly volatile, and the United Nations has been \nwatching the cycle of violence in the region rather \nhelplessly. In the most recent conflict between the \nPalestinians and Israelis, approximately 2,000 people \nfrom Gaza, mostly women and children, died at the \nhands of the Israeli army, and approximately 70 Israelis, \nall of them soldiers except for three children, lost their \nlives. The continuing expansion of Israeli settlements \non Palestinian land, despite repeated calls for restraint \nby the international community, is unacceptable, as it \nundermines any prospects for a two-State solution. The \nUnited States Government has played a very strategic \nand useful mediating role in the past, but the United \nNations must now take up its commanding role in \nseeking a peaceful settlement that is just, durable and \nacceptable to all the Members of the United Nations.\n\nFourthly, as part of its core mandate in promoting \nglobal peace and security and greater understanding \namong peoples of different backgrounds and cultures, \nthe United Nations must do more to advocate a culture \nof peace, tolerance and understanding, not only among \nthe world\u2019s great religions but also among Member \nStates themselves. That is important, as we continue to \nwitness a growing propagation of disinformation and \nmisrepresentation, especially by the Western media, \nabout Islam in general and the application of sharia law, \nparticularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi \nArabia is the birthplace of Islam, and sharia is the \nlegal system in Islam and the only divine Constitution \nfor not only the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but all \nIslamic States. Therefore, the incessant criticisms and \nmisrepresentations of the application of sharia law in \nSaudi Arabia or anywhere else are disrespectful and \nabhorrent. It is an insult to all true Muslims to describe \nsharia law as barbaric. As a matter of fact, the most \nbarbaric laws are those that are not based on any divine \nteachings. Sharia is the legal system that the almighty \nAllah has prescribed for all Muslims, and we will apply \nit to the letter.\n\nIn the same vein, the General Assembly should be \ncommended for the designation, two years ago, of World \nInterfaith Harmony Week. It urged Member States to \ndesignate the first week of February each year as World \nInterfaith Harmony Week, when messages of goodwill \nand tolerance are spread through mosques, churches \nand other places of worship. While that was a good \nbeginning for promoting peace and harmony among \nreligions and peoples of different belief systems, the \nUnited Nations must do more to counter the continuing \nattacks on Islam, in particular by people who do not \neven believe in the existence of a supreme creator \ncalled Allah. Those infidels have no moral high ground \nto describe any religion \u2014 because they do not believe \nin God, and religion belongs to God \u2014 much less say \nanything about a religion as pure, authentic and noble \nas Islam.\n\nFinally, the United Nations must play its central \nrole in addressing the injustices associated with the \nunilateral or bilateral application of economic and \nfinancial sanctions by one Member State against \nanother as a coercive tool of foreign policy, because that \ncontravenes the fundamental principles of international \nlaw, international humanitarian law and the principles \nand norms governing peaceful coexistence among \nsovereign States. In that regard, the Gambia calls on \nthe United States Government to unconditionally end \nthe long-standing United States embargo on Cuba, \nwhich has brought about untold hardship for the Cuban \npeople. Is it not ironic that the Power talking today \nabout respecting Ukrainian sovereignty and freedom \nto choose their own way of life is the same Power that \nhas maintained a system of unjustifiable collective \n\n\npunishment against the Cuban people for almost five \ndecades, thereby devastating their economy, simply \nbecause, just as the Ukrainians today, Cubans decades \nago opted for a system of governance of their choice?\n\nThat brings me to the subject of climate change. \nClimate change and development are inextricably linked. \nThe impact of climate change is felt in all countries, \nparticularly developing countries, as it undermines \ntheir ability to achieve sustainable development. While \nAfrica is not responsible for the pollution and the other \nfactors causing climate change, it stands to suffer the \nmost. With 96 per cent of Africa\u2019s agriculture being \ndependent on rainfall and 50 per cent of the fisheries-\nrelated jobs estimated to be lost by 2050, climate change \nposes dire consequences for livelihoods in Africa. The \nGambia firmly believes that mitigating the adverse \neffects of climate change requires a timely and decisive \nglobal response. It is a challenge that should unite us, \nnot divide us. In that regard, the Gambia joins other \ncountries affected by climate change and like-minded \ngroups in urging the developed countries that are \nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change to fully implement their commitments \nunder the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nIn 1974, the Assembly adopted the Declaration on \nthe Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder (resolution 3201 (S-VI)), which was designed \nto address some legitimate concerns of developing \ncountries, such as improving their terms of trade \nand other issues relating to the promotion of a more \nequitable international economic system. Many of \nthe political, economic and social issues that inspired \nthe new international economic order still remain \nunresolved, four decades after that historic declaration. \nAs the post-2015 agenda attracts our attention today, \nwe must not relegate those old concerns of developing \ncountries to the dustbin of history. In a nutshell, their \nold concerns, as well as their new aspirations, must \nno longer be set aside. To that end, the foundation of \nany transformative agenda should logically begin with \ngenuine reform of the global governance institutions, \nparticularly the United Nations system.\n\nGiven the current membership of the Security \nCouncil, the reform of that important organ of the \nworld body is long overdue. We African leaders have \nfor a very long time been calling attention to the need \nto restore the effectiveness and legitimacy of the United \nNations by allocating two permanent Seats with full \nveto powers, as well as two non-permanent seats on \nthe Security Council to reflect current geopolitical \nrealities.\n\nIf the demands for the reform of the Security \nCouncil in the interest of equity and justice cannot be \naccommodated, then concrete action must be taken for \nthe General Assembly to assume all the powers of the \nSecurity Council and its responsibilities, including the \npower to impose sanctions. Under such an arrangement, \nall decisions of the General Assembly would have to be \nvoted for by all Members and endorsed by the majority \nof its membership, thus ensuring a more democratic \nand transparent global body called the United Nations.\n\nOn a final note, I want to call the attention of the \nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to the very \nfrequent and mysterious sinking and capsizing of boats \ncarrying mostly black African migrants looking for \ngreener pastures in the West, only to end up in body \nbags on European shores. Strangely enough, those \ncountries, which pretend to love Africans so much \nthat they are always preaching to African leaders \nabout good governance, the rule of law and respect \nfor human life and rights, have been eerily quiet about \nthe very dangerous, racist and inhuman behaviour of \ndeliberately causing boats carrying black Africans to \nsink, selecting only a few lucky ones to be rescued \nand sent to concentration camps, called asylum-seeker \ncamps. Those camps are as bad as Nazi concentration \ncamps, and nobody, no country or human rights \ninstitution in the West has ever raised the alarm to that \nsort of genocide in the twenty-first century.\n\nIf earlier Africans who received the European \nexplorers before colonialism had treated them the \nsame way, Africa would not have been colonized for \n400 years. The European explorers were nothing short \nof people seeking greener pastures for their fellow \nEuropeans, as Europe had, at the time, turned into \nbrown pastures. After 400 years of colonial looting and \nmisrule in Africa, Africa today is reduced from green \nto brown pastures, owing to overgrazing. Now African \nexplorers are not only unwelcome, but are greeted with \ninstant death on European soil. That is unacceptable.\n\nThe United Nations must therefore conduct a \nfull and impartial investigation into that man-made \ncatastrophe, namely, the sinking or capsizing of boats \ncarrying young Africans to Europe. If those boats are \nable to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean \nSea, only to sink on European coasts, we must find out \nwhat deadly mysterious force exists on the European \nMediterranean coasts that causes boats carrying young \n\n\nAfricans to disintegrate and sink upon arrival. Racism, \ngreed and hatred can only breed hatred, violence and \ndisastrous confrontation between races. We African \nleaders should stand up together, I hope, to protect those \nyoung Africans from mass murder on European coasts. \nI hereby call on the United Nations to commission such \nan investigation as a matter of priority and urgency in \norder to avert a major racial confrontation. We have the \nright as Africans to defend our black people, wherever \nthey are. As we welcomed all races to Africa, we will \nnot accept that Africans should be treated like dogs, \nwith impunity. That is unacceptable. If the United \nNations fails to take action, we will take action. And \nthe action we take will be determined by us.\n\nIn the Gambia we do not attack people because \nthey are white or black, or because of their religion. \nNo foreigner in the Gambia would say, \u201cI was attacked \nbecause I am a foreigner\u201d. If a foreigner comes into \ncontact with the police, it is because he has committed \nan offence for which even a Gambian would be \narrested. If we cannot tolerate each other, the world will \nnever see peace, because nobody can stop migration. \nThe Almighty Allah created this world for us to move \naround, the same way Europeans moved around when \nEurope was bankrupt. Europeans came to Africa for \n400 years. We never killed them. They overstayed, and \nsome of us had to fight to get them out. Now they have \novergrazed our land. We also want greener pastures, but \nEuropeans cannot accept us. Let them send Africans \nback, but do not kill them. Europeans have no right to \nkill them.\n\nOut of the hundreds of European explorers who \ncame to the Gambia in those days, only one European \ndied on the River Gambia over a span of 400 years. \nToday, over a span of five years, more than 500 \nGambians have lost their lives on European coasts. \nThat is unacceptable. Enough is enough, and the United \nNations must intervene, and intervene quickly, or else \nwe will all live to regret our failure to take appropriate \naction at the right time.\n\nGeopolitical realities have changed. Let the West \naccept that, and with us endeavour to change along \nwith those realities, as we move together towards \nthe peaceful, brighter future we want. The so-called \nmilitary super-Powers must know that humankind \nwould be sent back to a pre-Stone Age should they be \nreckless enough to unleash World War III.\n\nWe cannot have our cake, eat it as we please, and \nat the same time dictate to others how, when and where \nthey should eat theirs. In the twenty-first century, \nhumankind has a need only for super-Powers of peace \nand development, not for mediaeval European-style \nwarmongers. Why can we not accept the diversity of \nthe human race and its attendant diversity in cultures, \nreligions and ways of life as each of its diverse groups \ndeems fit?\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to represent my country here at the United Nations. \nIn recent years, the world has witnessed Georgia\u2019s \nunwavering transformation to freedom, democracy \nand economic development. We have experienced \ntremendous advances, and occasional challenges, on \nour journey to a fuller and more open democracy. We \nare a vastly stronger nation than we were 20 years ago, \n\n\nand we are a much stronger nation than we were just two \nyears ago. While we have made significant progress in \na few short years, we are still a young democracy, and \nmuch remains to be done.\n\nI am fortunate to be part of a new generation \nof Georgians who grew up in the years following \nthe Cold War. My entire life is one of being part of \nremarkable change. Our tremendous progress is due to \nthe commitment of the Georgian people to democratic \nvalues and their embrace of international cooperation. \nBecause our democratic transformation has been so \nhard, we do not take anything for granted. To paraphrase \nPresident Kennedy: we do not do these things because \nthey are easy, we do them because they are hard. During \ndifficult times, the Georgian people took to the streets \nin peaceful protest and made their voices heard at the \nballot box to ensure that our democratic path continued. \nI want to express my sincere admiration for the people \nof Georgia and for their energy and commitment to \nsecuring our democratic progress.\n\nI would also like to express my gratitude to \nthe international community, our partner countries \nrepresented in this Hall and international organizations, \nespecially the United Nations, for supporting Georgia \nand listening to the Georgian people. Despite all the \nchallenges that we have faced, the citizens of Georgia \nare full of hope. The support from the international \ncommunity and international organizations continues \nto play a crucial role in Georgia\u2019s progress. On behalf \nof the people of Georgia, we thank them. Georgia\u2019s \nsuccess is their success. Georgia\u2019s journey is a testament \nto the good work done by the United Nations and our \ninternational partners.\n\nIn the past two years, we have taken concrete steps \nto break the vicious cycle of Government corruption, \nimpunity and an economy that benefited only a few. \nWe have created a true democracy with a system of \ngovernance that is more open, more transparent and \nmore accountable and that upholds the rule of law. We \nhave established a social compact that rewards work \nand enterprise, while offering support for those in need.\n\nAs recognized by various international \norganizations, the Georgia of today is another world \ncompared to that of two decades ago, or even just two \nyears ago. Every sector of our country has advanced \ndramatically, from health care and education to the \neconomy and the rule of law. We are now at the dawn \nof a new day for Georgia. Our democratic institutions \nare stronger. Our foreign policy is making us more \nsecure. Our growing economy is working to benefit all \nGeorgians.\n\nWe are strengthening and consolidating Georgia\u2019s \ndemocracy. The parliamentary, presidential and \nmunicipal elections held in Georgia during this two-\nyear period are truly something to celebrate. Because \nGeorgia\u2019s democracy was hard-won, there is no going \nback. The Georgian people will hold the Government \naccountable at the ballot box. My Government must \nearn every vote by serving the people faithfully and by \nachieving progress for the country.\n\nWe are strengthening democratic institutions and \nestablishing stronger checks and balances. Our new \nConstitution decentralizes executive power and creates \ngreater accountability at all levels of Government. Our \nParliament now functions as a true legislature. Laws \nare proposed, debated and amended. Committees hold \nhearings and question ministers. The old rubber stamp \nhas been thrown away. We now guarantee the protection \nof human rights through a new human rights strategy \nand action plan. In addition, we are equally proud to \nhave enacted a new anti-discrimination law that extends \nthe protection of human rights to all Georgian citizens.\n\nWe have restored the rule of law by establishing an \nindependent judiciary and by instituting more rights for \ndefendants. We have ended impunity by Government \nofficials and torture and abuse in our prisons. All \nGeorgians are now equal before the law. No one is above \nthe law. Everyone will have the benefit of a judicial \nprocess that meets the highest international standards.\n\nWe are committed to building truly strong, \nindependent and high-quality media. The media, like \ncivil society, are essential to a strong democracy. While \nI may not always agree with what the media say or \nwrite, I will always fight to make sure that they have \nthe right to the freedom of speech.\n\nSuch reforms will benefit all citizens of my country. \nOur goal is to unify our society through the rule of law \nand democracy. Our commitment to aligning more \nclosely with the United States and Europe goes hand \nin hand with our commitment to continued democratic \ntransformation. The United States is a key strategic ally \nof Georgia. The relationship between our countries at \nall levels of Government has never been stronger.\n\nIncreased Euro-Atlantic and European integration \nis our way of returning to the family of European \n\n\nnations, with whom we share a history, a culture and, \nmost important, common values. Our new Association \nAgreement with the European Union and our steadfast \nmovement towards NATO membership form the \nfoundation for that relationship and provide an umbrella \nfor greater engagement. As German Chancellor Angela \nMerkel said at this very rostrum, there is no development \nwithout security and no security without development \n(see A/65/PV.5). Our Association Agreement is the \nmaster plan for the gradual establishment of European \npolitical, economic, social and legislative norms and \nstandards. My country has embarked on a demanding \npath of wide-ranging reforms. We will deliver on our \ncommitments.\n\nI believe that Georgia\u2019s democratic transformation \ncan serve as a model for other countries in the region. \nToday, we pledge to share our experience with nations \ngoing through similar transitions. As we deepen our \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration, we are also \nbecoming a truly open and globalized economy. We \nare making important investments and reforms to \nunlock the full potential of the Georgian economy \nand the Georgian people. From universal health care \nto investments in clean energy, Georgia is becoming \na twenty-first-s we pursue those reforms, we seek to \nimplement the United Nations development agenda \nbeyond 2015. We have become a leader in sustainable \ndevelopment, taking the outcomes of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development seriously. \nWe are ready to work together with the international \ncommunity to define a post-2015 development agenda \nthat is inclusive and people-centred. That agenda \nwill address the need to achieve economic stability, \nsustained economic growth, the promotion of social \nequity and the protection of the environment. At the \nsame time, we are committed to enhancing gender \nequality, women\u2019s empowerment and equal employment \nfor every Georgian.\n\nThe future belongs to the next generation, so the \nprotection and development of our children to achieve \ntheir full potential must be based on greater investment \nin their education.\n\nA top area of concern for Georgia is the issue of \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. There \nare hundreds of thousands of IDPs in Georgia as a result \nof Russia\u2019s military aggression. Yet Georgia is still \ntaking in refugees from other conflict-torn regions. \nSadly, the sources of new refugees are increasing, not \ndecreasing, especially in the light of current conflicts \nin Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nWe are also doing everything we can to help \nour friends in Ukraine by providing humanitarian \nassistance, political support, technical help \u2014 such as \nsending doctors and medicine \u2014 and serving as a safe \nrefuge for children affected by the conflict. We are also \nhelping them implement reforms and strengthen their \ndemocratic institutions. The ongoing developments \nin Ukraine tear at our hearts. We strongly support \nUkraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. We \nhope that the recent peace treaties will put an end to \nthe military operations once and for all and mark the \nbeginning of an irreversible peacemaking process.\n\nThe international community has spoken with \nincreasing support every year for the right of return \nby adopting the General Assembly resolution on the \n\u201cStatus of internally displaced persons and refugees \nfrom Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/\nSouth Ossetia, Georgia\u201d. It is essential that the General \nAssembly continue to retain this humanitarian issue \non the agenda and support the rights of the forcibly \ndisplaced with strength and conviction.\n\nI should now like to address my brothers and \nsisters in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. I say to my \ndear brothers and sisters, I dream of the day when we \nshall all live together in peace and prosperity. We are \ncommitted to the path of reconciliation and restoring \nGeorgia\u2019s full territorial integrity and sovereignty. We \nmust work to find a way for them to participate in our \nsuccess, including the benefits of our new European \nUnion Association Agreement.\n\nI also call on the Russian Government to fulfil \nits obligations under the 2008 international ceasefire \nand join in the search for peace, prosperity and \nreconciliation. Our history and our values are a source \nof strength. When combined with our strategic location, \nthis allows us to offer something unique to the world \nand serve as a driver of peace and security.\n\nBeyond our borders, we aim to contribute to global \nsecurity as a supplier of security, not just a consumer. \nMy country\u2019s dedication to becoming a security \ncontributor to the world is evident in our aspirations \nfor European and Euro-Atlantic integration, which are \nthe main pillars of Georgia\u2019s foreign policy. Building \non the achievements of the past two years, my country \nhas made significant progress that reinforces our path \nto eventual NATO membership. The historic NATO \n\n\nSummit reaffirmed that Georgia will be a member of \nNATO in the future, and our people remain committed \nto this ultimate objective. As a result of the decisions \ntaken at the Wales Summit, NATO will significantly \nincrease Georgia\u2019s integration and provide tangible \ncooperation initiatives that will increase Georgia\u2019s \ncapabilities and overall security.\n\nWe are the largest non-NATO contributor to the \nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan \n(ISAF), and we are committed to taking part in the post-\nISAF mission. From the operation\u2019s outset, our troops, \nincluding medical personnel, staff officers and training \ninstructors, will be ready for deployment. We also plan \nto contribute to institution-building in Afghanistan.\n\nWe stand with our allies in combating all forms of \nterrorism and organized crime, anywhere in the world.\n\nWe are also proud to contribute to the European \nUnion\u2019s efforts under the Common Security and \nDefence Policy to build peace and security worldwide. \nIn that context, as the second-largest participant, a \nGeorgian battalion and a light infantry company have \nalready started a mission under the EU-led operation in \nthe Central African Republic.\n\nOur willingness to serve shoulder to shoulder with \nour allies is not the only way Georgia is serving as a \nglobal security provider. We are also taking a rational \napproach to reducing regional tensions and preventing \nconflict.\n\nLet me be clear, Georgia will never sacrifice its \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty. However, we will \ncontinue to look for pathways to reconciliation with our \nbrothers and sisters in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nWe Georgians want a good relationship with \nRussia, but never at the expense of our sovereignty and \nindependence, which we fought so hard to achieve. To \nthat end, we are pursuing a new approach, different \nfrom that of our predecessors, in dealing with Russia. \nWe are pursuing a two-track engagement strategy \nbased on our being a responsible, pragmatic and \nconstructive neighbour. On the first track, we started an \nunconditional dialogue with Russia on the resumption \nof trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian relations. \nOn the second track, we have continued to seek a \npeaceful settlement of the August 2008 war and the end \nof Russian occupation of Georgian territory, based on \nthe fundamental principles of international law.\n\nThe first track has produced significant results \nand has helped reduce tensions between Georgia and \nRussia. Trade has reopened and Georgian exports to \nRussia have increased over 300 per cent. People-to-\npeople exchanges have also increased dramatically. \nWe are coexisting more calmly as neighbours. This \napproach has also increased stability in the entire South \nCaucasus region.\n\nHowever, Georgia\u2019s efforts to reduce tensions and \nextend an olive branch to Russia have not been met \nwith the same spirit of cooperation. We have taken \nevery constructive step. Now it is time for the Russian \nGovernment to stop the occupation and start on a path \nto lasting peace.\n\nMy country is committed to using its strategic \nlocation to connect Asia, Europe and the Middle East, \nthereby expanding trade from one end of Eurasia to \nthe other. The reopening of the Silk Road is one of \nthe greatest achievements brought about by the end of \nthe Cold War. The Silk Road region accounts for two \nthirds of the world\u2019s population and 60 per cent of its \ngross domestic product. If its potential is fully tapped, \nit will become a key force for the expansion of trade, \nthe development of new energy resources and supply \nchains and the promotion of cultural exchanges. To \nfully unlock that potential, the international community \nmust redouble its efforts in three key areas: trade and \ntransport, energy, and people-to-people contacts.\n\nWe have deepened cooperation with Turkey, China, \nKazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, \nUzbekistan and Afghanistan to integrate transportation \ncorridors and open new routes that will bring goods \nfrom Asia to Western Europe in record time. Energy \nresources are a key driver of Silk Road economic \ndevelopment and integration.\n\nWe support a key route for Caspian Sea oil and gas to \ntravel to Europe. Last year, the Shah Deniz Consortium \nannounced a massive expansion of the South Caucasus \nPipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia, which \nwill bring 16 billion cubic metres of new natural gas \nto Europe and Turkey and thousands of new jobs to \nGeorgia. Several days ago, I was in Azerbaijan to break \nground and lay the first segment of that new pipeline. \nThe expansion will lead to approximately $2 billion in \nnew investment by the Consortium in Georgia alone. Of \ncourse, that will result in Georgia receiving significant \nquantities of natural gas to improve our economic \ndevelopment and security.\n\n\nClean, renewable energy can also be a driver \nfor regional energy cooperation. In Georgia, we are \nutilizing our massive hydropower resources to become \na carbon-neutral country and to export renewable \nenergy to our neighbours. The potential of the region \nis great, but more is needed to turn such potential into \nreality. Georgia is ready to use its location as a strategic \ncrossroads and to do its part to fully revitalize the Silk \nRoad. To that end, I intend to establish a Silk Road \nforum in 2015, and in Georgia we plan to launch an \nannual high-level meeting of all States and international \norganizations that are interested in the future of the Silk \nRoad. The forum will discover new ideas for enhancing \ncooperation in the fields of transport, energy, trade and \npeople-to-people contacts across the Silk Road. The \nforum will move beyond discussion to action.\n\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm that I am so very \nconfident that our best years are ahead of us, and \nthat our worst are now part of history. I am confident \nthat Georgians have come together to move our \nnation forward and to fulfil the promise of a strong, \nindependent and free, great Georgian nation. Working \ntogether, there is no limit on what Georgia, the region \nand the world can achieve. I look forward to seeing \nmany present here today in Tbilisi.\n"

        "file_text": "The events of the past months \nfill us with sadness. We have entered another grim \nera of conflicts. What has happened in Ukraine and \nin Syria and Iraq illustrates that. The core values and \nrules on which the United Nations is based have been \nviolated. The crisis in Ukraine has a deep impact on \nthe security of Europe. We have not experienced such \nbreakdown since the tragedy of the Balkan wars. But I \nwant to stress that Ukraine is not only a question limited \nto Europe. It should \u2014 and eventually will \u2014 concern \nall of us.\n\n\nA rule-based international system is a precondition \nfor peace and security, for human rights and \ndevelopment. If we cease to protect this system, it \nwill cease to protect us. It would be a dramatic and \nfar-reaching mistake to let our rule-based order slip \ntowards chaos and the law of the jungle. Unfortunately, \nthe Security Council has not been able to uphold its \nresponsibilities either in Ukraine or in Syria. We need \nto reform the Security Council. Finland supports the \nefforts to restrict the use of veto.\n\nI am pleased that the General Assembly adopted \nresolution 68/262, entitled \u201cTerritorial integrity of \nUkraine\u201d, on 27 March, by a clear majority. Yet the \nvoice of this important body should have been even \nstronger, condemning Russia\u2019s actions and charting \na way towards ending violence and restoring peace. \nWhen the territorial integrity of a Member State \nis violated and it loses control over a part of its own \narea through an illegal annexation, the Member State \nshould be able to turn to the United Nations for justice \nand remedy. De-escalation in Ukraine cannot happen \nwithout Russia\u2019s active steps. Russia should control its \nborder and prevent the flow of arms and fighters and \nthereby contribute to stabilization of the situation in \neastern Ukraine. Only a political solution can solve this \ncrisis. We have recently seen some steps towards that, \nbut a lot still remains to be done.\n\nAs the Secretary-General has reminded us, the \ninternational community must not abandon the people \nof Syria. We cannot forget those who have died or those \ndriven from their homes \u2014 half of the population of \nSyria. Three million Syrians have been received as \nrefugees in the neighbouring countries. The Syrian \nconflict can be solved only by political means. Finland \ncontinues to give its full support to the United Nations \nSpecial Envoy for Syria. Women in Syria, as in other \nconflict-driven countries, must be included in the \npeace process. We welcome women\u2019s active efforts to \nstrengthen their voices in Syria and eslewhere.\n\nThe war in Syria has severely affected the \nsecurity situation in the whole region. The geographic \nexpansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \norganization, with its horrendous terror, is a by-product \nof the conflict. That situation has serious consequences \nlocally, regionally and internationally. That challenge \nmust be tackled together through wide-ranging \ninternational cooperation. Finland will contribute to \nthose common efforts.\n\nThe international community showed determination \nlast autumn after the chemical attacks in Syria. The \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-\nUnited Nations Joint Mission for the Elimination of \nthe Chemical Weapons Programme of the Syrian Arab \nRepublic focused on the verification and destruction \nof Syria\u2019s chemical weapons programme. Finland has \nworked alongside the Joint Mission in that demanding \noperation. We must remain vigilant. In order to fulfil \nits United Nations commitments as well as to comply \nwith the Chemical Weapons Convention, Syria must \ntake further action. We must show that determination \nagain. I strongly reiterate the appeal to the Security \nCouncil to refer the Syrian situation to the International \nCriminal Court (ICC). The ICC must be used when the \nnational justice system is not able to deliver.\n\nThose conflicts are unfolding at a time when \ncooperation and common efforts are more needed \nthan ever. We share the same global challenges, such \nas climate change. Ebola is another serious threat. To \nhelp, Finland will double its assistance. It is critically \nimportant to us and our planet that we address them \ntogether. Here, I want to express my gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for his leadership in addressing \nthose challenges.\n\nIntergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \nagenda will commence soon. We should aspire to a new \nkind of global commitment to fulfil both the needs of \nmankind and planet Earth. We owe this to our children \nand their children. To achieve sustainable development, \nwe need clear objectives. We need to be able to monitor \nour commitments in an efficient way. All resources \nand means should be mobilized. We cannot rely only \non traditional resources any more. Public funding for \ndevelopment is still important for the poorest and those \naffected by conflicts. But at the same time, domestic \nresource mobilization, innovation, trade and technology \nand investments must play a stronger role in sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nMany countries of the global South enjoy a robust \neconomic growth. That provides an opportunity to \ninvest in tax systems, which in turn generates public \nresources for sustainable development. A just tax and \nredistribution policy is one of the most efficient ways \nto reduce inequalities and fight marginalization. The \nrule of law and the fight against corruption play a huge \nrole as well.\n\n\nI trust the Secretary-General to be both \nvisionary and concrete when setting the scene for \nthe intergovernmental negotiations. This process \nwill culminate next year in this very Hall. The best \nway to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \nUnited Nations next year is to adopt transformative \ncommitments that set us on a path towards sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nI started by describing the grim state of international \nrelations. My analysis is not an excuse for inaction, but \na call to redouble our diplomatic efforts. We must act \nwith determination, and we must act now. Finland will \nsupport efforts to restore peace and prevent further \ndamage to our rule-based international system. We \nmust also aim high in addressing together the broader \nglobal challenges of climate change and sustainable \ndevelopment."

        "file_text": "It is indeed a great \nhonour and pleasure to participate in this General \nAssembly debate at its sixty-ninth session on behalf \nof the Government and people of Tuvalu. I extend my \ncongratulations to Mr. Kutesa on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. We wish the Assembly success under his able \nguidance. I also wish to thank the outgoing President, \nAmbassador John Ashe, for a successful sixty-eighth \nsession. Likewise, I applaud Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, the Secretariat and all the specialized United \nNations agencies and staff for their tireless efforts and \nenergy.\n\nLet me also note for the record Tuvalu\u2019s sincere \ncongratulations to the people and the new Government \nof Fiji under Prime Minister Bainimarama for the \nsuccessful holding of general elections. In the same \nvein, we also congratulate New Zealand on its \nsuccessful elections.\n\nThrough the United Nations, we have worked \ndiligently to deliver on the noble visions and principles \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Our \nshared goals are world peace, security and prosperity. \nTuvalu celebrates its thirty-sixth anniversary of \nindependence next week on 1 October, and we remain \ncommitted and proud to be a Member of this great \nbody. We must applaud the achievements of the United \nNations.\n\nBut we should not be over-congratulatory. Tuvalu \nalso feels the sadness of the loss of lives and the suffering \nof fellow human beings from crises the world over. The \nlosses resulting from terrorism, poverty, environmental \ndegradation \u2014 especially climate change \u2014 and Ebola, \nalong with the loss of lives owing to political conflicts \nin Syria, Israel, Palestine, the Middle East, Ukraine and \nmany other regions of the world, are most disturbing, \neven for distant countries like my own Tuvalu in the \nPacific. Tuvalu shares in the grief of those people. We \nin the United Nations must work harder to address the \nroot causes of such crises. We support the ongoing \nreform efforts in the United Nations, and in particular \nwe urge the reform of the Security Council through an \nexpansion of its permanent and non-permanent seats \nand its agenda, in order to include climate change as a \nSecurity Council issue.\n\nAs we go on, though, one question stares us right \nin the eyes. Do we leaders really care? And do we mean \nwhat we say here at the United Nations, in this great \nHall? Recently a kindergarten class in Tuvalu asked me \nthis question: \u201cDo we have a tomorrow, and can you, \nas Prime Minister, save us?\u201d Reflecting on how this \nbody can help respond to those fundamental questions \ngives me mixed feelings. We are indeed encouraged by \nthe momentum of some strong leadership on climate \nchange, as was displayed at the Climate Summit earlier \nthis week.\n\nBut we are also discouraged by the lack of concern \ndisplayed most conspicuously by the deniers of climate \nchange, including some of our neighbours in the Pacific. \nTuvalu believes that the United Nations must not be \ndistracted by them. We must remain committed to \nturning the momentum of the political leadership set in \nmotion this week into real action for a more collective, \nstrategic and pragmatic response to world crises. We \nmust walk the walk, as well as talk the talk, on every \nfront of our human crises if we are to ensure global \npeace and security.\n\nWe have talked a lot in the United Nations about \ndesigning sustainable development goals and a post-\n2015 development agenda. The tentative goals and \ntargets identified are reflective of a membership that is \nseeking the same high aspirations and honourable goals \nas those enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \nnamely, a world of peace, security, opportunity and \nprosperity. The United Nations must remain universal \nand relevant in bringing the real issues and events into \nfocus and keeping the attention of the global community. \nIt should be more responsive and understanding of the \ndiverse circumstances and needs of its membership \nand the importance of contextualizing its strategic \nactivities, taking into account the variable and special \ncircumstances of each Member. It must also improve \nits presence in all countries, particularly in vulnerable \nStates like Tuvalu.\n\nWe must also heed the lessons of the world \nfinancial crisis, which reversed some of our hard-\nearned development advances related to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Those global realities \naffect even remote, small island countries like Tuvalu, \nand can further exacerbate their vulnerabilities. \nThe new sustainable development goals, with better \naccountability and transparency measures, must provide \neconomies, big or small, with the capacity to address \nvulnerabilities and ensure sustainability. They must \nalso help to improve the means of implementation and \ncreate governance mechanisms that are inclusive and in \nwhich the voices of all countries and all stakeholders, \nincluding local Governments and authorities, are heard \nin decision-making.\n\nThe dedication of 2014 as the International Year \nof Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is much \nappreciated. At the beginning of this month we \ncongregated in the beautiful and tranquil island of the \nindependent State of Samoa for the Third International \nConference on Small Island Developing States, which \nconcluded with an outcome document outlining the \nSmall Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities \nof Action, or Samoa Pathway, and with the creation \nof many constructive partnerships aimed at addressing \nthe special needs and circumstances of SIDS.\n\nWhile Tuvalu acknowledges and greatly appreciates \nthe support of the United Nations membership, and \nthe exemplary leadership of the Samoan Government \nand people, leading to the Conference\u2019s huge success, \nwe also believe that the ultimate measure of success \nfor SIDS is the delivery of tangible action on the \nground, reflecting and accommodating their unique, \nspecial case. It is urgent that we seriously consider \nthe proper integration of the SAMOA Pathway and a \nspecial window for SIDS into the post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations, and into \nall other programmes in the United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies, in order to achieve their effective \nimplementation, with particular attention to simplified \naccess to climate change financing for small island \ndeveloping States.\n\nThe graduation criteria and their application to \nleast-developed countries (LDCs) require proper \nscrutiny and review, because they are mostly not \nrelevant to the characteristics of SIDS. A small island \ndeveloping State may achieve a high per capita gross \nnational income and a high human development index, \nbut it will always be a small island developing State; \none cannot graduate from the natural constraints and \nenvironmental vulnerabilities of being a small island \ndeveloping State. Recognizing the call made in the \nSAMOA Pathway and given the ambiguity surrounding \nthe recommendations for Tuvalu\u2019s LDC graduation, \nTuvalu seeks further deferral of that graduation until \na thorough assessment and review of the application \nof LDC graduation is done, taking full account of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s \n\n\nrecent Least Developed Countries Report 2013 and \nother studies dealing with Tuvalu.\n\nWith Tuvalu\u2019s 24 square kilometres of land \njuxtaposed against 900,000 square kilometres of the \nPacific Ocean, the sea has always been our people\u2019s \nlifeline to food and economic growth. As a custodian of \nthe Pacific Ocean, Tuvalu fully supports a sustainable \ndevelopment goal on oceans, as we do the Palau \nDeclaration on oceans issued by the leaders of the \nPacific Islands Forum. We call on the United Nations \nto honour the health of the oceans, because they are \nthe Earth\u2019s life-support system. To that end, we also \nsupport the commencement of negotiations towards an \nimplementing agreement under the law of the sea that \ncan better protect the oceans.\n\nThe seriousness and urgency of the need for action \nto combat climate change have been reaffirmed, not only \nby the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change but also by world leaders, \nand was strongly echoed by youth leaders this week \nin this very Hall. What more do we need to hear to \nstop the denial of the need for action against climate \nchange? In Tuvalu, we are experiencing unprecedented, \nlife-threatening effects of climate change. As a low-\nlying country with an elevation of barely two or three \nmetres above sea level, like our fellow atoll island \nnations of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives, \nTokelau and all other small island developing States, \nTuvalu is finding that its security and survival, and \nthe future and human rights of its citizens, are being \nseriously compromised. We cannot continue along that \npath.\n\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Summit, held \nearlier this week, which, on behalf of Tuvalu, I was \nhonoured to co-chair with the President of Bolivia, gave \nus yet another opportunity to hear from young people, \nwomen and community leaders on the front line of the \nimpacts of climate change from every region of the \nworld, including my own Pacific region. Their message \nfrom the front line is simple, loud and clear: leaders of the \nworld, do it! Save us!\n\nTime is running out, and it would be grossly immoral, \nextremely irresponsible and even illegal to pretend that \nwe did not hear the alarms and voices of those who are \nsuffering at the forefront of climate change. Tuvalu \nhighly commends the Secretary-General for his strong \nleadership and welcomes the annoucements made by \nthose Heads of State and Government who contributed \nto actions against climate change during the Summit. \nWe commit to building on that momentum and that of the \nrecent SIDS meeting up to the Lima meeting later this year \nand onwards in Paris in 2015.\n\nTuvalu fully supports a stand-alone sustainable \ndevelopment goal on climate change. We urgently need \na commitment from all countries to supporting a new \nclimate change protocol, to be concluded in Paris in 2015. \nWe must urgently address climate change in a legal and \nforward-looking manner. Otherwise, our post-2015 agenda \nwill be meaningless and many will be left behind. We \ntherefore urge all parties to work urgently to negotiate a \nnew protocol, to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to \nkeep the average temperature rise well below 1.5\u00b0C. The \nprotocol must include loss and damage and insurance \nmechanisms for SIDS against climate change and must \nprovide adequate and accessible financing for adaptation \nsupport to SIDS, such as Tuvalu.\n\nThere is no time for half-measures, such as we \nwitnessed in Copenhagen in 2009. It is also critical that \nthe new Green Climate Fund and the other existing climate \nchange funds be adequately resourced and that access by \nSIDS be simplified for expedient action on the ground.\n\nWe all must step up and commit to reducing our \nemissions and to supporting those who are vulnerable. As \nfor my own country, despite our negligible greenhouse gas \nemissions, we are committed to employing 100 per cent \nrenewable energy for our electrification by the year 2020. \nWe are already well on the way to achieving that target, \nthanks to the generous support of international partners, \nincluding the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, Italy, \nAustria, the United Arab Emirates, the International \nUnion for Conservation of Nature and the International \nRenewable Energy Agency. Tuvalu is also a party to the \nMajuro Declaration.\n\nTuvalu has made steady progress towards the \nachievement of its MDGs, with strategic complementary \nassistance from the donor community. We have designed \na road map for development to move forward from the \nMDGs, and to the sustainable development goals in \ngeneral. We have adopted and implemented national \npolicies on financial management, women and gender \ndevelopment, people with disabilities, young people and \nthe protection of families, as well as on other sectors of \nnational priority, such as climate change, energy, food \nsecurity, fisheries, information technology, health care, \neducation and outer islands development. Much needs to \nbe done in order to properly deliver on those policies. We \n\n\nare committed to doing that. We call for support from our \ninternational partners through mutual partnerships with us \nin Tuvalu.\n\nThe future we want is one of inclusiveness, where all \npartnerships are important. The Government of Tuvalu \nreiterates its position that the economic, commercial and \nfinancial embargo against Cuba runs counter to the need to \npromote dialogue and to fulfil the purposes and principles \nof the Charter of the United Nations, which calls for \nsolidarity, cooperation and friendly relations among all \nnations.\n\nTuvalu also fully supports Taiwan\u2019s meaningful \nparticipation in United Nations specialized agencies and \nmechanisms, including the World Health Organization, \nthe International Civil Aviation Organization and the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. We recognize the cooperative spirit shown by \nTaiwan in its involvement in the post-2015 development \nagenda dialogue. We recognize the need to include \nTaiwan in the global fight against climate change. We also \nrecognize Taiwan\u2019s role as a regional peacemaker. Taiwan \nsupports scholarships and capacity-building for experts, \nstudents and officials from Tuvalu and many developing \ncountries.\n\nFinally, I want to say the following in clear and \nunambiguous terms. We are at a turning point for the \nfuture of small island nations such as Tuvalu. We can \ncreate MDGs and design sustainable development goals \nbut, unless there is a global commitment to those goals, \nparticularly against climate change, we will have failed \nhumankind. Unless we stop greenhouse gas pollution, we \nwill have failed future generations. The future is ours to \ncreate. Let us be bold. Let us take heed of the strong and \nloud message from those on the front line that we have \nheard here in this very Hall. Let us be seen as the ones \nthat created a future for all \u2014 a future that includes saving \nhuman beings and saving the children of Tuvalu. For if we \nsave Tuvalu, we save the world.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan, I would first like to congratulate \nMr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We \noffer him our best wishes and full support. We also \nextend our special gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his \nable leadership of the Assembly and his commitment \nto finding solutions to pressing international problems.\n\nThe world today is undergoing a major upheaval. \nThe global instability we face is a crisis of the global \neconomy, of international law and, in a broader sense, \nof a lack of vision for our world\u2019s future. To our deep \nregret, it seems that not all States yet recognize their \nfull responsibility for the fate of their neighbourhoods \nand the world as a whole. Instead of well-thought-\nout, viable solutions, we are witnessing a disturbing \nescalation of problems, drawing in more countries and \nmaking our shared hopes of peace and stability ever \nmore distant.\n\nRivalry among the major Powers over perceived \nspheres of influence, markets and control over \nthe production and transit of energy resources has \nincreased. Tensions are on the rise, and the dangerous \nand unacceptable belief in the right of power in world \npolitics has strengthened. As a result, we are witnessing \na renewed arms race and the use of military force to \nimpose and extend influence. Unilateral actions and \ndouble standards are destabilizing the international \nsituation, exacerbating tensions, inciting ethnic \nand religious strife and threatening the security of \nother States. In today\u2019s confusing media space, it is \nimpossible to distinguish lies from truth. This dire state \nof global affairs, rising tensions and mistrust between \nStates is undermining the efforts of the United Nations \nand entire international community to bring about a \npeaceful solution to any crisis by lawful means. It is \nalso deeply worrying to see the established architecture \nof international law being dangerously eroded.\n\nWhat is even more perilous is that radical \nmovements and extremist forces are skilfully \nexploiting the resulting uncertainty and instability in \nthe international system. We are particularly concerned \nabout the continuing violence in the Middle East and \nAfrica and the growing threats posed to some Asian \ncountries. We extend our deepest condolences to the \ncitizens and Governments whose civilians have been \nsenselessly killed during the violence.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine is of special concern to \nKazakhstan. The impact of the crisis now extends not \njust beyond the borders of Ukraine, but beyond the \nentire region. Kazakhstan supports peaceful initiatives \naimed at the speedy de-escalation of the conflict, \nincluding the Minsk peace agreements. The ceasefire \nmust be used to implement the peace plans of President \nPoroshenko and President Putin. These give hope for \nthe eventual stabilization of the situation in Ukraine. \nWe should also be concerned that the crisis in Ukraine \nhas led to mutual sanctions being imposed by countries \nthat together make up 60 per cent of the world\u2019s gross \ndomestic product. That will certainly have a damaging \neffect on global development and economic growth.\n\nNow more than ever, the world needs to come \ntogether to find an alternative model to solving \nproblems, based on equal partnership, broad dialogue, \nmutual respect and tolerance among all stakeholders. We \nare confident that the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe fundamental principles of international law provide \nthe basis for this model. The role of the United Nations \n\n\nmust remain pivotal and primary, while bringing States \ntogether and providing global leadership based on the \nequal participation of all Member States in the process.\n\nThe dynamics of our world today and the forecasts \nof what the future might hold must prompt world leaders \nto look beyond narrow national interests and to exercise \nthe highest degree of judgement and political will. What \nis at stake is nothing less than saving our civilization \nfrom destruction. This is not an exaggeration or \noverstatement. It is the harsh and threatening reality.\n\nWe are seeing a fundamental change in the structure \nof geopolitical, geo-economic and transnational \nrelations. What is emerging is a polycentric system \nof international transactions. Within that framework, \nnobody has the right to determine global and regional \nprocesses unilaterally. No country has exceptional \nrights or advantages. To help adjust to this emerging \nnew multipolar world order and promote the widest \npossible involvement in identifying the way forward, \nin 2012 the President of Kazakhstan proposed the \nG-Global initiative. It seeks solutions based on five \nprinciples, namely, a strong preference for evolutionary \nrather than revolutionary policy change; the crucial \nimportance of justice, equality and consensus; the \npromotion of global tolerance and trust; the need for \nglobal transparency; and, finally, the encouragement \nof constructive multilateralism. Unfortunately, the \ndecisions taken in the wake of the global financial \ncrisis by the Group of Twenty and the Group of Eight \nhave proved to be insufficient because they were not \nall-inclusive in their elaboration.\n\nKazakhstan therefore encourages Member States \nto use the G-Global platform for dialogue to help draw \nup plans \u2014 developed by all and acceptable to all \u2014 to \nprevent future global crises. We have already embarked \non that process through the Astana Economic Forum, \nwhich resulted in a draft anti-crisis plan offered to the \nUnited Nations. We believe that the plan should be \ntaken up by the General Assembly and the Economic \nand Social Council and given serious consideration.\n\nAt the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly \nin 1992, President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan initiated \nthe convening of the Conference on Interaction and \nConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). Like \nthe G-Global initiative, CICA emerged from the firm \nbelief that international progress could come about \nonly through strong and effective partnerships, built in \nthe spirit of solidarity among all countries, regardless \nof their political and economic development. CICA has \nbecome an effective multinational forum for enhancing \ncooperation and promoting peace, security and stability \nin Asia. Kazakhstan supports the initiative of China, the \ncountry that chairs CICA currently, for a new security \nconcept for Asia based on the principle of common, \ncomprehensive, cooperative and sustainable regional \nsecurity. That will enable us to consolidate CICA in the \nnear future and transform it into the Organization for \nSecurity and Development in Asia.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the General Assembly held an \ninformal meeting to mark the International Day against \nNuclear Tests. We are pleased that all those present \nexpressed their determination to bring about a world \nwithout nuclear-weapon testing and, ultimately, without \nnuclear weapons. That is an issue close to the hearts \nof the people of Kazakhstan, who have witnessed and \ncontinue to live with the terrible legacy of nuclear \ntesting. That is why we proposed 29 August as the day \nto raise awareness of this important issue, and why \nPresident Nazarbayev has launched the Abolish Testing: \nOur Mission Project, a global education campaign on \nthe perils of nuclear testing.\n\nThe closure of the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test \nSite and the renunciation of the world\u2019s fourth-largest \nnuclear arsenal \u2014 both inherited from the Soviet Union \nupon our independence \u2014 were defining moments \nfor our nation, and the starting point for the peaceful \nforeign policy we pursue today. Strengthening the \nglobal non-proliferation regime has remained one of \nthe most important priorities of Kazakhstan\u2019s foreign \npolicy. The signing in May of the Protocol to the \nTreaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central \nAsia \u2014 the Semipalatinsk Treaty \u2014 by the five \npermanent countries on the Security Council marked \na major moment for nuclear security in our region. \nWe now urge the \u201cnuclear five\u201d countries to ratify the \nProtocol as soon as possible. We strongly encourage \nall stakeholders to uphold the provisions of Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the \ncornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, and to work \ntowards the early entry into force of the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\n\nWe share the objectives of the proposed convention \non the general and complete prohibition of nuclear \nweapons. Again, we call on all Member States to adopt \nthe universal declaration on a nuclear-weapon-free \nworld. That would serve as the first step towards the \nadoption of the convention.\n\n\nReaffirming our commitment to the principle \nof the equal right of all countries to access nuclear \ntechnology for peaceful purposes, Kazakhstan stands \nready to host the international bank of low-enriched \nuranium under the auspices of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We also support an \nearly political and diplomatic solution with respect \nto Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, on the basis of strict \ncompliance with the provisions of the NPT and IAEA \nregulations. Kazakhstan helped break the deadlock \nin the negotiations by hosting the first two rounds of \nresumed talks in Almaty last year. We welcome the \nlatest 5+1 talks and strongly hope an agreement can be \nreached in November.\n\nWe, together with the entire international \ncommunity, are alarmed that terrorist groups are \ncreating quasi-State entities to fight legitimate \nGovernments and sow enmity and hatred. Religious \nextremism and separatism are fuelling a rise in \nterrorism, transnational crime and the illegal trafficking \nof narcotics. Kazakhstan was a sponsor of resolution \n2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist fighters, because we \nbelieve that the fight against international terrorism \ndemands a long-term comprehensive approach.\n\nWe also strongly believe that interreligious and \ninterethnic harmony are essential prerequisites for \npeace and security. Kazakhstan, a diverse nation of 130 \nethnic groups and many different faiths, has worked \nhard to build a culture of tolerance and respect. We have \nsought to promote those values internationally through \nthe Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional \nReligions, an event that has taken place every three \nyears since 2003. The Congress and its participants \nhave unanimously renounced violence and pledged their \nsupport for continued interreligious dialogue among \nleaders of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, \nHinduism, Taoism and many other faiths. Just last week, \na preparatory meeting of religious representatives for \nthe fifth Congress, to be held in Astana in 2015, issued \na statement condemning extremism, violence and \nterrorism conducted in the name of any religion.\n\nKazakhstan initiated the suggestion that the period \n2013-2022 be proclaimed as the International Decade \nfor the Rapprochement of Cultures. Greater dialogue \nand the exchange of ideas between different cultures \ngreatly enhance international security.\n\nThe situation in Afghanistan in the wake of the \nrecent elections and the ongoing withdrawal of the \ncoalition forces is a matter of importance for the wider \nsecurity of Central Asia. We congratulate President-\nelect Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and the people of \nAfghanistan on the completion of the electoral process. \nWe look forward to close cooperation with Mr. Ghani \nand Abdullah Abdullah as they form, and work together \nin, the National Unity Government.\n\nEconomic development is key to Afghanistan\u2019s \nre-emergence as a peaceful and prosperous nation and \ngood neighbour in Central Asia. Kazakhstan fully \nsupports Afghanistan\u2019s integration into the region\u2019s \nexpanding network of trade, energy and transportation \nlinks. We have taken practical steps to assist in the \nrehabilitation of our neighbour. The Government of \nKazakhstan has allocated almost $3 million for the \nconstruction of social infrastructure and has provided \nmore than $17 million in humanitarian food assistance. \nWe are spending $50 million to train approximately \n1,000 Afghan students in Kazakhstan universities. The \nfirst civilian students will soon successfully complete \ntheir education in Kazakhstan and join the peaceful \nreconstruction process in their home country.\n\nIt is clear that we in Central Asia face a number \nof challenges that endanger stability not only in \nspecific countries but in the entire region. There \nis regrettably little sign that those problems will \ndisappear in the near future. That is why the United \nNations and the international community need to \nwork more purposefully in Central Asia. Accordingly, \nKazakhstan\u2019s call for the establishment of the United \nNations regional hub in the city of Almaty is highly \nrelevant. The United Nations plays an invaluable role \nin addressing natural and man-made disasters and \nassisting countries in their sustainable development \nthrough the coordination of the activities of national, \nregional and international actors. We believe that, with \nthe focus on humanitarian assistance and development, \nthe regional United Nations hub in Almaty would \ncomplement the work of the United Nations Regional \nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia in \nAshgabat, Turkmenistan. The presence of those two \nregional United Nations entities would cover a very \nbroad range of challenges faced by countries in our \nvast region, including Afghanistan. Of course, the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan stands ready to offer its \nfull support in establishing and developing the hub.\n\nSustainable development is central to Kazakhstan\u2019s \nambitions for the future. We commend the United \nNations and the Secretary-General for convening \nthe action-focused Climate Summit a few days ago. \n\nWithin our borders, we are working hard to achieve our \nnational plan to make the transition to a green economy \nand have recently adopted voluntary commitments to \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nA national system for greenhouse gas emissions \ntrading has already been put into operation. We are \nalso determined to support sustainable development \nglobally.\n\nIn 2017, Astana will host the international \nspecialized exhibition Expo 2017 on the theme \u201cFuture \nEnergy\u201d, which will promote best practices in the \nfield of sustainable energy. We will provide support to \nrepresentatives of around 60 developing countries to \ntake part in Expo 2017.\n\nKazakhstan, in conjunction with the Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, is launching \na project on the installation of biogas systems in nine \nsmall island developing States of the Pacific, which will \nhelp local communities produce electricity. At the same \ntime, Kazakhstan and the United Nations Development \nProgramme are developing a training programme in \nthe sectors of oil and gas, agriculture and medicine for \ncountries in Africa, Oceania and Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n\nAs the largest landlocked country in the world, \nKazakhstan attaches great importance to the upcoming \nsecond United Nations Conference on Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries, to be held in Vienna in \nNovember. The meeting aims to review and build on \nthe Almaty Programme of Action in order to produce a \nnew road map for landlocked developing countries that \ntakes into account the challenges and threats that have \nemerged since the Almaty plan was first developed, \nover a decade ago.\n\nIn 2015, we will finish construction of the \nKazakhstan section of the Western Europe-Western \nChina International Transit Corridor, which offers the \nshortest route from China to Europe and reduces transit \ntimes by up to 10 days, making it four to five times \nshorter than the sea route through the Suez Canal. By \n2020, we expect the volume of freight traffic on the \ncorridor between China, Central Asia, Russia and \nEurope to reach 33 million tons annually.\n\nThe construction of new rail routes is also bringing \nour region together as never before. This December, \nwe plan to open the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran-\nPersian Gulf railroad, which will carry up to 10 million \ntons of cargo a year and allow us to increase our wheat \nexports five-fold. Another rail route, Uzbekistan-\nTurkmenistan-Iran-Oman-Qatar, which was first \nagreed in 2011, will also greatly increase international \ntransit capacity for our region.\n\nAs the Assembly knows, Kazakhstan is a candidate \nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for \nthe period 2017-2018. Its election would be a major \nstep for our country, which has never before served on \nthat body. Our extensive engagement in international \naffairs, including chairing key regional organizations, \nsuch as the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, \nhas given us the experience necessary to discharge that \nimportant responsibility. We believe that the priorities \nand challenges of our region should be represented in \nthe Security Council, and Kazakhstan is ready to play \nthat role.\n\nWe are a peaceful, stable and fast-developing \ncountry, with a reputation for impartiality and for taking \nan effective, balanced approach, with a strong focus \non international cooperation, conflict prevention and \nmediation. Overall, we are confident that we can fully \ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace, \nsecurity and development, as well as the improvement \nof the Council\u2019s working methods.\n\nOnly by working together, in a partnership in \nwhich all States Members of the United Nations are \ntruly equal, regardless of their level of political and \neconomic development or geographic location, can we \nachieve peace and security for all \u2014 a peace that is free \nfrom fear and violence and meets the needs of future \ngenerations.\n\n\nI would like to end by quoting Nelson Mandela, \nwho said:\n\n\u201cPeople respond in accordance to how you relate to \nthem. If we approach them on the basis of violence, \nthat\u2019s how they\u2019ll react. But if you say we want \npeace, we want stability, we can then do a lot of \nthings that will contribute towards the progress of \nour society\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "In this year \n2014, proclaimed by the General Assembly as the \nInternational Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian \nPeople, Israel has chosen to make it the year of a new \nwar of genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian \npeople. It is the year in which the Assembly, on behalf \nof the countries and peoples of the world, conveyed \nthe world\u2019s yearning and determination to make a just \npeace that would achieve freedom and independence \nfor the Palestinian people in their State of Palestine \nalongside Israel. The occupying Power has chosen to \ndefy the entire world by launching its war on Gaza, in \nwhich its jets and tanks brutally destroyed lives and \ndevastated the homes, schools and dreams of thousands \nof Palestinian children, women and men and, in reality, \ndestroying any remaining hopes for peace.\n\nI addressed the Assembly on similar days in 2012 \n(see A/67/PV.12), when I cautioned that the colonial \noccupying Power was preparing a new Nakba against \nthe Palestinian people. I appealed to the Assembly then \nto prevent a new Nakba and to support the establishment \nof a free and independent State of Palestine. I returned \nto the Assembly Hall two months later (see A/67/PV.44) \nas Palestine was healing its wounds and its people were \nburying their beloved martyred children, women and \nmen after yet another war waged then against the Gaza \nStrip. On that day, I stated that there was certainly \nnot a single person in the world who needed the loss \nof the lives of thousands of Palestinian children in \norder to confirm that Israel insisted on occupation. The \ninternational community also did not need thousands \n\nof deadly raids and tons of explosives to remind it that \nthere was an occupation that must end and a people who \nmust be freed.\n\nAgain today, we find ourselves full of grief and \nbitterness, raising the same long-standing conclusions \nand questions after a new war, the third in five years, \nwaged by that racist occupying State against Gaza, \na small, densely populated and precious part of our \ncountry. The difference today is that the scale of \nthat genocidal crime is larger. The list of martyrs, \nespecially children, has grown, as hs the number of \nthe wounded, the disabled and the dozens of families \nwho have been completely decimated. The difference \ntoday is that approximately half a million people have \nbeen displaced from their homes. An unprecedented \nnumber of homes, schools, hospitals, public buildings, \nresidential buildings, mosques, factories and cemeteries \nhave been destroyed \u2014 the Israelis pursued their \nvengeance against our young even into the cemeteries. \nThe difference today is that the devastation caused by \nthat recent aggression is unmatched in modern times, \nas confirmed by a witness, the Commissioner-General \nof the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \nPalestine Refugees in the Near East.\n\nThe latest war against Gaza constituted a series \nof absolute war crimes, carried out before the eyes \nand ears of the entire world, moment by moment. It \nis inconceivable that anyone today could claim not to \ngrasp the magnitude and horror of the crimes. No one \ncan support Israel\u2019s right to self-defence without regard \nfor the fate of the thousands of victims of our people. \nNo one can ignore the simple fact, upon which we \ninsist, that the life of a Palestinian is as precious as the \nlife of any other human being. Ignoring the facts on the \nground cannot erase such facts. We must also assume \nthat no one can continue to wonder why extremism is \nrising and why the culture of peace is losing ground \nand receding, while efforts to achieve it are collapsing. \nAnd yet we continue to believe and hope that this time \nno one will try to help out the occupation by supporting \nits impunity and its attempts to evade accountability \nfor its crimes.\n\nHere, today, in the name of Palestine, I affirm that \nwe will not forget or forgive, and we will not allow war \ncriminals to escape punishment. Before the Assembly, \nI affirm that the Palestinian people will hold fast to \ntheir legitimate right to defend themselves against the \nIsraeli war machine and to resist Israel\u2019s colonial, racist \noccupation. At the same time, I want to affirm that not \nfor one moment will our grief, trauma and anger make \nus abandon our humanity, our values and our ethics. We \nwill always maintain our respect for and commitment \nto international law, international humanitarian law \nand the international consensus. We will maintain the \ntraditions of our national struggle established by the \nPalestinian martyrs, to which we have been committed \nsince the start of the Palestinian revolution in early \n1965.\n\nIn the midst of a torrent of massacres and the \nturmoil of vast destruction, we saw the peoples of the \nworld gather in huge demonstrations on the streets of \nmany cities to announce their condemnation of Israel\u2019s \naggression and occupation and their support of freedom \nfor Palestine. We also saw how an overwhelming \nmajority of countries around the world declared \nthemselves for the same noble position and rushed to \ngive our people all kinds of support and assistance. \nAnd we saw a qualitative and quantitative expansion in \nthe activities of the international grassroots boycotting \ncampaign against Israel\u2019s policies of occupation, \napartheid and colonial settlement, especially among \nacademic, cultural, student and youth groups. In the \nname of Palestine, we pay tribute to all who chose \nto stand with human values and demanded freedom, \njustice and peace. All of those manifestations of true \nsolidarity constituted an important message to those \nwho faced genocide in Gaza, helping them to feel that \nthey were not alone.\n\nThe recent war confirmed on the ground the \nessence of what the Israeli Government had been saying \nbehind closed doors in negotiations. It came after long, \ndifficult negotiations held over more than eight months \nunder the auspices of the United States and through the \nefforts of President Barack Obama and his tenacious \nSecretary of State, John Kerry. We engaged in that \nendeavour and with the American Administration\u2019s \nefforts with open minds and in good faith and a positive \nspirit. We laid out firm positions based on resolutions \nof international legitimacy. We genuinely respected \nall our commitments and understandings. Even as we \nwatched the ongoing and escalating Israeli violations, \nwe exercised incredible self-restraint, silencing our \ncries and tending to our own wounds in order to give the \nAmerican efforts the best possible chance for success.\n\nHowever, as usual, the Israeli Government missed \nno opportunity to undermine the chances for peace. \nThroughout the months of negotiations, settlement \nconstruction, land confiscation, home demolition, \n\n\nkilling and arrest campaigns and large-scale forced \ndisplacement in the West Bank continued unabated. The \nunjust blockade of the Gaza Strip was tightened. The \noccupation\u2019s campaign specifically targeted the city of \nJerusalem and its inhabitants, attempting to artificially \nalter the spirit, identity and character of the Holy City \nand focusing on Al-Aqsa Mosque while threatening \ngrave consequences. At the same time, armed gangs \nof racist settlers persisted in their crimes against the \nPalestinian people and their land, mosques, churches, \nproperty and olive trees.\n\nAgain as usual, the Israeli Government failed \nthe test of peace. It breached an agreement with the \nUnited States Administration regarding the release \nfrom the occupation jails of a number of Palestinian \nprisoners, who we continue to insist should all be \nreleased. When confronted with simple questions \nduring the direct negotiations or through the United \nStates mediator, Israel had no hesitation in revealing \nits true positions. It refuses to end the occupation of \nthe State of Palestine that began in 1967; rather it seeks \nto continue and entrench it, rejecting the Palestinian \nState and refusing to reach a just solution to the plight \nof the Palestine refugees. That is the Government of \nIsrael\u2019s official position. At best, the future it proposes \nfor the Palestinian people consists of isolated ghettos \nfor Palestinians on fragmented lands, without borders \nor sovereignty over its air space, water and natural \nresources, under the subjugation and control of the \nracist settlers and the army of occupation; at worst, it \nis a totally abhorrent form of apartheid. Some of the \nIsraelis say they are for two States. Where is the State \nof Palestine? This is what they intend for the State of \nPalestine.\n\nIsrael confirmed during the negotiations that it \nrejects making peace with its victims, the Palestinian \npeople. All of this has been carried out along with \nan attempt to brand the conflict as a religious one \nagainst a background of increasingly rampant racism \nin Israel\u2019s political and media discourse, as well as its \nentrenchment in the school curriculum and a series \nof laws and practices in favour of the occupation and \nits settlers. This culture of racism, incitement and \nhatred was glaringly apparent some months ago in \nan appallingly despicable crime committed by fascist \nsettlers, who abducted Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a \nyoung boy from Jerusalem, burned him alive and killed \nhim.\n\nThis brings me to another fact of history. Over the \nyears, the occupying Power has pursued a policy aimed \nat deliberately weakening the Palestinian National \nAuthority in order to undermine it and make its role \nirrelevant. The occupation has targeted our relentless \nefforts to establish the foundations for the kind of \nState of Palestine that we want \u2014 a sovereign and \nindependent State living in peace and building bridges \nof mutual cooperation with its neighbours, respecting \nits commitments, obligations and agreements and \nstrengthening the values of citizenship, equality, \nnondiscrimination, the rule of law, human rights and \npluralism.\n\nWe want a State that deepens Palestine\u2019s enlightened \ntraditions of tolerance, coexistence and non-exclusion, \nstrengthens the culture of peace, promotes the role \nof women, establishes an effective administration \ncommitted to the standards of good governance, and \ncares for the needs and interests of its people. The \noccupation struck, and continues to strike, a blow at \nthis effort because our quest is the antithesis of Israel\u2019s \nsettlement policies, and because Israel seeks to destroy \nPalestine\u2019s chance of creating an independent State \nwithin the framework of the two-State solution.\n\nWhen our efforts to end the internal division \nthrough national dialogue succeeded a few months ago \nand we prepared to restore the unity of our land, nation \nand institutions, we formed a national-consensus \nGovernment and began a process that was to lead to \npresidential and legislative elections. All countries \naround the world welcomed this achievement, with \nthe exception of Israel, which has constantly sought to \nfragment our land and our national unity.\n\nWhere do we go from here? The idea that one can \nsimply return to the past patterns of actions that failed \nrepeatedly is naive at best and, in any case, wrong. \nFor it ignores the fact that it is no longer acceptable or \npossible to repeat methods that have proved futile, or \nto continue with approaches that have repeatedly failed \nand that require comprehensive review and radical \ncorrection.\n\nIt is impossible \u2014 I repeat, impossible \u2014 to return \nto the cycle of negotiations that failed to deal with \nthe core of the Palestinian question. There is neither \ncredibility nor seriousness in negotiations in which \nIsrael predetermines the results via its settlement \nactivities and the occupation\u2019s brutality. Nor is there \nmeaning or value in negotiations in which the agreed \n\n\nobjective is not ending the Israeli occupation and \nachieving the independence of the State of Palestine, \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, on the entire \nPalestinian territory occupied in the 1967 war. Moreover, \nnegotiations that are not linked to a firm timetable for \nthe implementation of this goal have no value. The time \nhas come to end this colonial occupation.\n\nPalestine refuses to have the right to freedom of its \npeople, who suffer terrorism at the hands of the racist \noccupying Power and its settlers and remain hostage \nto Israel\u2019s security conditions. The Palestinian people \nare actually the ones who need immediate international \nprotection \u2014 a protection they are seeking through \ninternational organizations. They are in need of the \nsecurity and peace that they more than any other people \nare denied. And the children of Palestine are worthy \nof the world\u2019s efforts to ensure that their childhood, \ndreams and lives will not once again be destroyed. It is \ntime for the chapters of this renewed, ongoing tragedy \nto be closed.\n\nThose who were uprooted from their warm homes, \ngood land and beautiful country in Al-Nakba 66 years \nago, who were pushed into the misery of exile to live \nas refugees, and are now being forced into new waves \nof expulsion or onto ships of death on the world\u2019s seas, \nneed assurances. They need to be assured that they \nwill not be displaced from their homes again, that their \nhomes will not be destroyed again, and that they will \nnot spend their lives waiting for the outbreak of a new \nwar. Is it not time for this long tragedy to end?\n\nWe will not forever accept demands to prove our \ngood intentions by making concessions at the expense \nof our rights, to remain silent as we are killed and our \nland is stolen, and to understand the conditions of \nthe other party and the importance of preserving its \ncoalition Government, while its occupation becomes \nmore entrenched. We are exhausted by the additional \ntests that we must undergo to prove our efficiency, \ncompetence and eligibility to earn our natural, simple \nright to live a normal life; our inherent right to expect a \nstable and ordinary tomorrow and to dream about more \nbeautiful days; and the right of our youth to plan their \nfuture safely with peace and freedom prevailing over \nour land, like other peoples of the world. The time has \ncome for a genuine and ust peace to prevail in the land \nof peace. As I have said more than once, we are the only \npeople in the world that remain under occupation.\n\nAll the Arab countries and ourselves have \nconstantly warned about the disastrous consequences \nof the continuing Israeli colonial occupation and the \ndenial of freedom and independence to the Palestinian \npeople. We have repeatedly pointed out that allowing \nIsrael to act as a State above the law without being held \naccountable or punished for its policies, aggression \nand defiance of the international community\u2019s will \nand legality has provided fertile ground for, and an \nenvironment conducive to, the growth of extremism, \nhatred and terrorism in our region.\n\nConfronting the terrorism that plagues our region \nby groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \nand others, which have no basis whatsoever in the \ntolerant Islamic religion or humanity, and whose \nmembers are committing vile and heinous atrocities, \nrequires much more than military confrontation. The \nmatter is of the utmost urgency and requires much \nmore than condemnations and declarations of positions, \nwhich are of course necessary. What is needed, first and \nforemost, is a comprehensive, credible strategy to dry \nup the sources of terrorism and eradicate its roots in all \npolitical, intellectual, economic and social spheres in \nour region. It requires the creation of solid foundations \nfor a practical consensus rendering the fight against \nall forms of terrorism everywhere a collective task to \nbe undertaken by an alliance of peoples, nations and \ncivilizations. It requires, as a priority, ending the Israeli \noccupation, that in its practices and perpetuation, \nconstitutes an abhorrent form of State terrorism and a \nbreeding ground for incitement, tension and hatred.\n\nAt a time when we are still suffering from the horrors \nof war, we face a formidable challenge to reconstruct \nwhat has been destroyed by occupation. This is the third \ntime we are attempting to rebuild after the destruction \ninflicted on us by the occupation. We greatly appreciate \nthe fact that next month, at the invitation of the Arab \nRepublic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Norway, the city \nof Cairo will host an international conference on relief \nand reconstruction for the Gaza Strip. Our Government \nwill present comprehensive reports to the conference \non the losses the acts of aggression have inflicted on \nvarious sectors of society, and it will provide details \nof plans and programmes to be rapidly implemented \nin the Gaza Strip, aimed at meeting immediate relief \nneeds and the requirements for reconstruction, in full \ncoordination with and under the supervision of the \nrelevant United Nations agencies and bodies.\n\n\nJust a couple of days ago, the Palestinian faction \nemphasized its support for Gaza in order to facilitate \n\n\nreconstruction. While we reiterate our appreciation and \ngratitude to all the countries and organizations that \nhastened to help the Palestinian people both during \nand after the war, we are confident that brotherly and \nfriendly countries will not waver in their support for \nthe plans and programmes we will present, and that \nthe conference will have practical results that can meet \nthe expectations and needs of the victims of this act of \naggression.\n\nWe reaffirm here that the chief prerequisite for \nthe success of all these plans and efforts is an end \nto the despicable ongoing Israeli blockade that has \nsuffocated the Gaza Strip for years and turned it into \nthe largest prison in the world for nearly 2 million \nPalestinian citizens. At the same time, we affirm our \ncommitment to and the importance of consolidating \nthe ceasefire through the negotiations being conducted \nunder the auspices of Egypt. However, in order to avoid \na repetition of the cycle of war and reconstruction every \ntwo or three years, it is imperative that we focus on \nthe fundamental issue and starting point, which is that \nGaza\u2019s suffering will never be completely over until \nthe occupation is ended and the State of Palestine\u2019s \nindependence achieved.\n\nDuring the past two weeks, Palestine and the Group \nof Arab States have been working intensively with the \nvarious regional groups in the United Nations to prepare \nfor the introduction of a draft resolution on the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict for adoption by the Security Council \nand to advance efforts to achieve peace, which we still \nbelieve can be accomplished through international \nlegitimacy. This endeavour reaffirms our commitment \nto achieving a just peace through a negotiated solution \nand a diplomatic and political effort through United \nNations bodies. It is inspired by and based fully on the \nspirit and provisions of the many resolutions that have \nbeen adopted in the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil, laying the foundations for a lasting solution \nand a just peace. There is nothing new here. All of these \nare previously adopted resolutions.\n\nThis endeavour hopes to correct the failure of \nprevious efforts to achieve peace by affirming the \ngoal of ending the Israeli occupation and achieving \na two-State solution for the State of Palestine, with \nEast Jerusalem as its capital, over the entire territory \noccupied in 1967, alongside the State of Israel, and with a \njust and agreed-on solution to the plight of the Palestine \nrefugees on the basis of resolution 194 (III), with a \nspecific time frame for implementing those objectives, \nas stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. There must \nbe a time frame. That will be linked to the immediate \nresumption of negotiations between Palestine and Israel \nin order to demarcate the borders, reach a detailed and \ncomprehensive agreement on all final status issues and \nthen draft a comprehensive peace treaty between us and \nthem.\n\nWe are confident that this endeavour will enjoy the \nfull support of those who are committed to ensuring that \nour country will not witness new wars and atrocities, \nwho wish to support a campaign to combat terrorism, \nwho believe we must act expeditiously to rectify the \nhistorical injustice inflicted by the Nakba on the people \nof Palestine, and who wish to see peace prevail in the \nland of monotheistic religions. The adoption of that \ndraft resolution will affirm that this year the Assembly \nis striving to realize the International Year of Solidarity \nwith the Palestinian People, who will continue to be \nsteadfast in their struggle and will rise brave and strong \nfrom the rubble of destruction. As our poet Mahmoud \nDarwish has said, we are infected with the incurable \ndisease of hope, and we love life if we are given a \nchance at it.\n\nThere is an occupation that must end now. There is \na people who must be freed immediately. The hour of \nindependence of the State of Palestine has arrived, and \nI believe you are listening for it.\n"

        "file_text": "My \nGovernment warmly welcomes the theme proposed for \nthis debate regarding the post-2015 development agenda, \nsince it directly addresses the most pressing problems \nfacing humanity, namely, inequality, hunger, poverty, \ninjustice and underdevelopment, factors that create \nsituations that our community of the United Nations \ncannot and should not tolerate. We must address our \ntask decisively, and in doing so we must be guided by \nthe principles set forth in our Charter, but above all, we \nmust have the firm commitment of all members of the \ninternational community. Our peoples, who are calling \nfor the implementation of a truly transformational \nglobal development agenda, expect nothing else from \nus.\n\nIn that regard, I wish to point out that, by virtue of \nthe universal, comprehensive and ambitious nature of \nour goals, the consensus achieved so far in the effort to \ndefine the sustainable development goals of the post-\n2015 development agenda constitutes an essential point \nof departure for that purpose. In that regard, I think that \nthe process in question deserves our strong support and \nmust be allocated the requisite resources in a timely \nmanner to ensure full implementation. Consistent with \nthat principle, Peru fully supports this process and is \nconfident that the adoption next year of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda will lead to the establishment of a \ngenuine global partnership for sustainable development. \nThe process will have participatory monitoring \nmechanisms so as to ensure appropriate follow-up and \nmonitoring.\n\nI wish to highlight that a clear-cut convergence \nexists between the guidelines promoted by Peru \nthrough its public policies on social inclusion and the \ngoals agreed upon by the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals. In both cases, priority \nis placed on initiatives to reduce poverty and inequality \nin all its forms, and to eradicate extreme poverty and \nhunger, once and for all. Similarly, emphasis is placed \non the struggle for equality, the empowerment of \nwomen, access to quality education and the elimination \nof all forms of gender-based violence and violence \nagainst children. It is also worth highlighting the \nimportance of continuing sustainable economic growth \nand promoting formal and decent employment. Those \nissues, among others, are of vital importance to Peru.\n\nTo that end, we must reflect on what type of State \nwe have today and move forward to meet the challenge. \nIn the case of Peru, we are pleased to highlight that we \nhave implemented a set of State reforms geared towards \nattaining those objectives. Peru has been working hard \nto consolidate and build upon the foundations for \nsustainable development. Our nation is a clear example \nof how it is possible to achieve substantial progress in \njust a few years, without straying from the fundamental \nprinciples of the Charter, such as peace and security, \nhuman rights and development. In fact, Peru is one of \nthe countries that has made the most sustained progress \nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \nsome of which will have been attained even before the \n2015 deadline. Thus, thanks to economic growth and a \ncoordinated and comprehensive social policy, we have \nachieved significant progress in fighting poverty, given \nthat we had set ourselves the goal for 2016 \u2014 the end of \n\nmy term in office \u2014 to reduce that figure to under one \nfifth of the population.\n\nIn just one generation, Peruvians have implemented \na deep transformation based on the pacification of the \ncountry, the consolidation of democracy, stability, \nthe opening of its economy, as well as the creation \nand development of a social inclusion policy. That is \nprecisely why our aspirations, objectives and goals are \nincreasingly ambitious.\n\nWith that perspective, we see ourselves as an \nemerging country with strong institutions that is proud \nof its cultural diversity and of the skills of its people. \nWe have made significant progress in the reduction of \npoverty and child malnutrition. Our country is built \non an inclusive social platform that promotes equal \nopportunities, gender equality, justice and security.\n\nMy Administration is undertaking extraordinary \nefforts in that direction and has prioritized its action to \nfocus on the fields of health care, education, security \nand social welfare. On previous occasions, I have \ntalked about the body of first- and second-generation \nsocial programmes that we have been implementing, \namong which Qali Warma, which provides free meals \nin public schools, Juntos, a conditional cash-transfer \nprogramme, Pension 65, a non-contributory pension \nplan, and the Beca 18 scholarship programme are worth \nhighlighting. All of those programmes are coordinated \nunder a multisectoral strategy that prioritizes the \nhuman being and the family throughout their life cycle. \nThat strategy, which we call \u201cinclude to grow\u201d, is \nintended not only to alleviate the immediate needs of \nthe poor and extremely poor people but also to build \nthe capacities of individuals and to create opportunities \nfor all.\n\nThe Government of Peru has been increasing \nits budget for investment in social policies annually, \nreaching unprecedented figures. By way of example, I \ncan point out that the budget for 2015 has increased by \n12 per cent over that of last year, and that approximately \nhalf of that increase has been allocated to education \nand health care. The remainder is primarily for the \nexpansion of social programmes, the development of \ninfrastructure and the improvement of public safety, \nsince public safety is another major priority of my \nAdministration. Given that challenge, we constantly \nmonitor citizens\u2019 demands and organize State action \nto effectively address those requests robustly and \neffectively in order to generate the climate of peace and \ntrust much needed by our families.\n\nHistorically, Peru has faced another impediment \nto development: corruption. That is why we are \ntaking drastic measures against those people who, in \nshameful exercise of their duties and public functions, \nbetray citizens\u2019 trust. In that regard, in Peru, we are \nimplementing a concept of education and public and \npolitical ethics to be followed not only by those who \ngovern Peru but by all citizens, with a major emphasis \non those who implement and enforce the law. We are \nalso considering barring from public office for life \nthose who commit acts of corruption while carrying out \ntheir public duty.\n\nI would now like to talk about another major \nchallenge that we must overcome, namely, the world \ndrug problem. I would appeal to the international \ncommunity to continue to strengthen dialogue and \ncooperation so as to counter that scourge. We therefore \nbelieve that the special session of the General Assembly \nwill be an opportunity for the international community \nto jointly address that issue in a cooperative way. The \nscope of the threat is clearly global, and our response \nmust incorporate that dimension. We have given \npriority to a comprehensive strategy to implement \nalternative development and to support social inclusion \nprogrammes. In that way, we are regaining not only the \nterritory but also, most importantly, the people.\n\nHowever, in order to ultimately overcome that \nchallenge successfully, all relevant actors must \nparticipate actively. The joint and shared responsibility \nof producers and users, as well as the transit and \nfinancing countries, must facilitate the establishment \nof a comprehensive strategy, in which all those involved \nassume their responsibilities and adopt binding \nsolutions.\n\nOn the economic front, the recent adoption of \na national production diversification programme to \nexpand our production base, bring about a historical \nchange in the country\u2019s economic structure and create \nformal employment seeks to leverage our capabilities and \nresources by promoting sustainable industrialization, \nentrepreneurship and access to science and technology. \nWe are thereby adding value to our production and \nmaking our growth and development sustainable.\n\nWe seek to continue expanding and deepening \nour trade relations, improve the existing 17 trade \nagreements that cover approximately 95 per cent of \nour foreign trade, while also moving towards the \ncompletion of the Doha Round of the World Trade \nOrganization. Peru\u2019s aspiration to a more integrated \n\n\nworld is widely recognized. We therefore give particular \npriority to any participatory forum, such as the Pacific \nAlliance, which is an initiative that promotes the free \nmovement of persons, goods, services and capital and \ncooperation among its members, as well as the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation. That aspiration also \nincludes the right of all countries to achieve the highest \nlevel of social, economic and trade development. \nWe therefore reiterate once again the call to end the \neconomic blockade against Cuba, which affects that \ncountry\u2019s economic growth and delays its social and \nhuman development and has an impact on the welfare \nof its citizens.\n\nPeru\u2019s relationships with its neighbours are \nexcellent. I wish to highlight the recent settlement of \nthe maritime dispute with Chile, achieved on the basis \nof international law and the principle of the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, as well as the fact that the \nhanding down of the ruling of the International Court \nof Justice was the fastest in its history. In general, the \nway in which the entire case was conducted makes Peru \nand Chile an example for the world.\n\nPeru affirms its active participation in the \ninternational community. In that context, we will be the \nhost country for the twentieth United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in December. On that occasion, the \ndiscussions will be important but national commitments \nwill be essential. Today, I say that we need to organize \nthe largest alliance in history to address that critical \nchallenge, in which the agreements reached will define \nthe future of our civilization. As the host country, I urge \nthe heads of State and Government to maintain their \npolitical will, so as to move forward constructively with \nrepresentatives that have the capacity to take decisions. \nIt is not only a matter of capitalizing on the Green \nClimate Fund but also one of clearly setting out national \ncommitments and achieving a binding agreement.\n\nWe must be conscious that, for the first time, \nhumankind has achieved the capacity for mass \ndestruction without resorting to nuclear energy. In \nthat regard, it is vital that the international community \nbecome aware that world problems, such as climate \nchange, require global, rather than national, responses. \nAccording to a 2011 study by the Economic Commission \nfor Latin America and the Caribbean, the cost of global \nwarming to Peru is revealed in floods, droughts, thaws \nand warming waters and amounts to approximately 4 per \ncent of Peru\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP). If \nwe do not take immediate action, the economic impact \nof climate change could be over 5 per cent of GDP by \n2030 and 20 per cent by 2050. Peru also recently ratified \nthe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources \nand the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising \nfrom Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, which will soon be in force to promote such \ngenetic resources.\n\nToday\u2019s general debate finds us in a complex \nscenario with various severe political, humanitarian \nand economic crises. We are faced with major global \neconomic challenges regarding international security \nand global governance. The Security Council\u2019s ability \nto respond to the various crises around the world \nhas revealed the need to reform its work methods, \nincluding those related to the use of the veto. The \nSecurity Council needs to respond in an effective way \nto those situations, which requires comprehensive \nreform, including increasing the number of permanent \nand non-permanent members, making that body more \nefficient, democratic, transparent and representative.\n\nSpecifically on the Palestine issue, my Government \nconfirms the need to address the root causes of that \nconflict through negotiations to achieve a viable and \nlasting solution, overcoming the status quo and enabling \nPalestinians and Israelis to live in peace and to prosper \nin the two States with secure and recognized borders.\n\nThe international community faces various ever-\ngrowing phenomena that transcend borders. I am \nreferring to terrorism, transnational organized crime, \nthe global drug problem, corruption, trafficking in \npersons, sexual exploitation, trafficking in young boys \nand girls and in adolescents, and arms smuggling, \namong others. With regard to acts committed by \nterrorist groups all over the world in recent months, my \ncountry knows the consequences of such acts very well, \nand they have been most energetically rejected by my \nGovernment.\n\nCombating terrorism is a responsibility that \nthe international community must assume within \nthe framework of the law, with full respect for the \nfundamental rights of all peoples and the sovereignty \nof States. Regarding the condemnable events that \nhave occurred in several regions of the world, the \nGovernment of Peru has expressed its strong rejection \nof such barbaric and terrorist attacks by extremist \ngroups against the lives of innocent civilian hostages \nand religious and ethnic minorities. Those intolerable \nevents deserve the firmest condemnation by the \ninternational community.\n\n\nPeru is not just a country with its own history; it \nis also a civilization. Its culture is part of the world \nheritage of humankind, as recognized by UNESCO. \nThat recognition signifies a universal recognition of \nthe extraordinary work of our ancestors, who knew \nhow to harmonize development and the environment in \na sensible and creative way.\n\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Peru\u2019s \ncommitment to the development and implementation \nof the post-2015 agenda, focusing on sustainable \ndevelopment goals, and by reiterating my call to \nallocate the means required to make them a reality. In \nthe context of the upcoming Conference of the Parties \nto the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP-20) in \nLima, I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the \nPeruvian Government to the Conference objectives, and \nwe call upon the international community to participate \nactively with a constructive spirit for sustainable \ndevelopment in the interest of our peoples. Peru, the \ncradle of the Inca civilization and the international \ncapital of excellent gastronomy, is ready to welcome \neveryone.\n"

With the danger of \nterrorism and war spreading throughout the world, now \nis the right time to stop to reconsider our actions and to \ndo everything possible to bring an end to fighting, be \nit in our own homelands, neighbouring countries or in \nour regions.\n\nThe nature of global security has changed \ndramatically. We are seeing non-State actors, religious \nfundamentalists and rebellious criminal gangs \nterrorizing the globe and threatening the safety of \npeaceful people. Sadly, some States are standing behind \nthe terrorists and have become hubs and shelters for \ngrowing violence. But nowadays, the means of terror \nand war go far beyond the traditional concept of a lethal \nfight. Whatever the means of terror used, its goal is \nthe same \u2014 to frighten people, countries and, in some \ncases, the entire world.\n\nPeaceful and sustainable coexistence among \ncountries and within societies is not a self-evident \nfact. It requires collective efforts and determination \nand national commitment to a sustainable future that \nbelongs to all of us. Our common task as a group of \nnations is to maintain undivided security \u2014 we must \nuse all our efforts to stop the Islamic State of Iraq and \nthe Levant and Al-Qaida in order to maintain peace and \nsecurity in Middle East, but the same efforts need also \nto be deployed to manage the geopolitical challenges in \nEastern Europe.\n\nIt is our duty to support the peace, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of Ukraine. The threat arising in \nUkraine must be urgently tackled. The United Nations, \ntogether with NATO, the European Union and other \nregional organizations and their member States, should \nfulfil their duty and do everything possible to stop \narmed conflicts, prevent the redrawing of the borders \nof sovereign States and stop the creation of one frozen \nconflict after another.\n\nWe have to act together as a group of neighbours, \na group of States concerned about the future of the \ninternational community, the future of the world in \nwhich we live. It is very important to stop a conflict \nat its inception and to suppress the breeding grounds \nof terrorism, wherever they may be found. But most \nimportant, we should never abandon the values that \nhold us together, namely, respect for human rights and \nthe fundamental principles of State sovereignty and, \nnaturally, territorial unity.\n\nWhen it comes to the protection of those \nfundamental common principles, the international \ncommunity should be united and react responsively to \nany breach thereof. The fact that we continue to protect \ncore values was well illustrated by the voting results \non resolution 68/262, on the armed conflict in Ukraine. \nOne hundred States supported Ukraine and condemned \nthe occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. \nAn overwhelming majority of the Assembly will never \nrecognize such illegal acts of aggression.\n\nIf we fail and if violence, aggression and terror win, \nwe are at risk of waking up on the threshold of a situation \nwhere everyone fights everyone else and chaos prevails. \nEverything we have worked for, everything we have \ncreated \u2014 the world we live in \u2014 will be destroyed. \nSilent consent to such brutal forms of aggression should \nnot be the international community\u2019s answer.\n\nTo avoid an even grimmer future, I invite the \nAssembly to keep deception, lies, manipulation and \nignorance from entering our territories and violating \nour values. We have to go back to the core principle of \nthe United Nations, that is, to keep peace throughout the \nworld. Our undivided attention to maintain undivided \nsecurity should be our main focus.\n"

        "file_text": "Slovenia is among the vast \nmajority in the international community that desire and \nstrive for a lasting peace. However, the precondition \nfor that is the peaceful resolution of all disputes. The \nUnited Nations was founded mainly to serve precisely \nthat purpose, and that goal has often been achieved. \nWithin the contemporary international community, \nthe United Nations remains a very important tool for \nmaintaining and strengthening world peace.\n\nHowever, contrary to the Charter of the United \nNations, force is still being used in today\u2019s world. \nThere is even a strong feeling that, owing to new \ncircumstances, the existing architecture of the United \nNations \u2014 and above all the Security Council \u2014 is \nfailing in that fundamental role. Long ago, a debate \nbegan on the reforms that were needed, but thus far, it \nseems to have resulted in no decisive changes.\n\nHence, a sense of uncertainty about future \nstability and peace is gaining ground among the \npeace-oriented States of international community. \nIf the United Nations is not reformed so that it can \nsuccessfully cope with international conflicts, it risks \nbeing sidelined. Increasingly, deadlocks in the Security \nCouncil \u2014 which have sometimes come about for good \nreasons, but sometimes not \u2014 are taken as an excuse \nfor resolving conflicts by force and without a United \nNations mandate. If that trend continues, it may lead \nto the breakdown in the contemporary political and \nsecurity architecture. It is our common task to remedy \nsuch problems rapidly, thoroughly and by consensus, \nespecially with regard to the functioning of the United \nNations and the Security Council; otherwise, it may be \ntoo late.\n\nI suppose we all agree that a reformed and effective \nSecurity Council is needed, with its permanent \nmembers exercising their powers responsibly and in \naccordance with international law and the Charter of \nthe United Nations. We have to use this opportunity \nto rethink the international security architecture, \nimprove our capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts \nand reclaim our shared values and principles, which \nare enshrined in the Charter. With numerous ongoing \nconflicts around the world, we will have to do so before \ninternational peace is undermined.\n\nI cannot deny that, at times, in the absence of \nother means, specific circumstances may compel the \ninternational community to maintain peace by the use \nof force. Sometimes it is so. Nevertheless, a United \nNations mandate is essential to ensure credibility, \nat least in principle. If, however, intervening without \na United Nations mandate becomes the principle, the \nworld will certainly arrive at a point where an arbitrary \naction may trigger a conflict of broad dimensions. \nI think there are no moral grounds for such risky \nbehaviour.\n\nA comprehensive United Nations approach is \nalso needed to address the global threat emerging in \nthe broader Middle East and North Africa: the threat \nof terrorism, extremism and a militant radicalism that \nis distinctively different in its strategic approach and \nmethods of operation. We all have to condemn that \nthreat in the strongest terms and fight against it in a \nconcerted manner, bearing in mind the framework of \nthe mandate given by the Security Council. Because \nof the importance I accord to the Security Council, I \nwould like to reiterate my support for Security Council \nresolution 2174 (2014) adopted two days ago, which was \nendorsed by more than 100 States.\n\nAlthough the debate on the reform of the Security \nCouncil has been going on for decades now, it has \nrecently become especially relevant. My country, \nSlovenia, is committed to contributing to that debate to \nthe greatest extent possible.\n\nLet me finish by saying that, while the vision of a \nworld of peace may remain unfulfilled, the ideals that \nled to the establishment of the United Nations almost \n70 years ago and the need to preserve our humanity \nremain. Let us pool our resources and ideas. Let us exert \nleadership, make the necessary reforms and recommit \n\nto the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \nLet us re-establish dialogue and rebuild the trust we \nneed so much. That is the only way forward to maintain \nglobal order on the basis of international law and leave \na lasting legacy to the people and nations of this world.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure \nto begin this address with warm congratulations to His \nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \nalso wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe \non his inspiring leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session.\n\nThis year, we marked the 100th anniversary of the \nFirst World War. Our forefathers in 1918 called that \nWar the war to end all wars, because they knew, as we \nknow today, that no society can aspire to development \nand a better way of life without peace. At that time, \nmany Seychellois people gave their lives to defend that \nideal. Despite being one of the smallest nations in the \nworld, geographically far removed from the centres of \npower and of conflict, our people have always known \nthat we cannot be at peace if the world is not at peace. \nI take this opportunity to salute those who made the \nultimate sacrifice in those turbulent times of 1914 and \nthose islanders who showed that no matter how small \nwe may be, we can make a meaningful contribution.\n\nHowever, the turbulent events that have unfolded \nbefore our eyes during the course of 2014 have shown \nvery clearly that the world is not at peace. The heinous \nand murderous acts of global terrorist activities in \nrecent weeks remind us of the increasing threat posed \nby terrorism and of the pain that it brings to innocent \nvictims. That is coupled with a multiplication of \nregional conflicts and instability within States.\n\nIn order to build peace, we must reinforce our \ncommitment to multilateralism through the United \nNations, while also ensuring that we accord the highest \npriority to more inclusive and effective development. \nIn that context, I commend the President for placing the \ndiscussion in this year\u2019s general debate under the banner \nof \u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative \n\npost-2015 development agenda\u201d. Seychelles takes \npride in having achieved most of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and continues to impart greater \nimpetus to ensure that the remaining challenges are \neffectively dealt with by 2015.\n\nFor small island developing States (SIDS), the \nsustainable development goals are essential to allow \nfor the implementation of development transformation. \nWe must recognize that the current development \nframework of the majority of development institutions \nis still not favourable to the development of SIDS. Most \ndevelopment gains are still assessed ultimately through \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita measurements, \nwhich do not adequately identify the threats to human \ndevelopment or the opportunities that exist, especially \nfor small island States.\n\nSeychelles warmly welcomes the outcomes of \nthe Third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, held in Apia, and would particularly \nlike to thank the Government and people of Samoa for \ntheir leadership in establishing a platform for action to \nsupport the development of SIDS.\n\nSeychelles has championed three priorities that are \noutcomes of that conference. The first is the need for a \nvulnerability index to be used as a more effective tool \nfor addressing the development needs of SIDS than \nGDP per capita. The second is the need to address the \ndebilitating debt of SIDS through innovations, such as \ndebt for climate change adaptation swaps. The third \npriority is the need to build opportunities for SIDS \non the basis of their strengths, not their weaknesses; \nhence, the need to support a blue economy approach, \nwhereby SIDS can better utilize their oceanic potential \nand whereby we can be large-ocean nations.\n\nThose three priorities are not specific only to \nSIDS. The development challenges of SIDS highlight \nthe deficiencies of the development framework for \nall developing nations. A vulnerability index allows \nus to target those areas that place our societies at \nrisk. An effective vulnerability index adopted by \nthe United Nations will allow us to better target the \ndiverse needs of SIDS, least developed countries and \nlandlocked countries, as well as States threatened by \ndesertification or those most prone to natural disasters. \nIt is an inclusive view of development.\n\nOwnership of the blue economy also widens \ndevelopment perspectives for our whole planet. It is \nhigh time that we realize the immense potential of \nour oceans. We cannot apply the principles of a green \neconomy and of sustainable development without \nrecognizing that we are applying them in a blue world, \nfor over 70 per cent of our planet is covered by oceans \nand seas. For developing nations, the ocean is a shared \nopportunity. It is therefore essential that we address \nour oceans, and the challenges therein appropriately, \nthrough a stand-alone sustainable development goal on \noceans.\n\n\nThe right to development belongs to us all. True \ndevelopment is therefore not only about economic \ngrowth or the total wealth that a country can create. \nIt is about the constant improvement that we need for \nthe well-being of people. It is about being able to build \na future for our children based on shared opportunity. \nIn that vein, I reiterate the call that the international \ncommunity not spare any effort in helping the nations \nof West Africa to overcome the Ebola pandemic, which \nis a health issue of international concern. Ensuring \nthat the affected communities have access to the right \nmedical support will save lives not only in West Africa \nbut across the world. Ebola is not just an African \nproblem. It is a global problem.\n\nWe also remain preoccupied by the conclusions of \nthe Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change. That is why SIDS have \ncontinuously underlined the scientific research being \nconducted on climate change, which shows that a \nwarming of even 1.5\u00b0C will have a negative impact \non all countries, even if islands are on the front line. \nHowever, the science also tells us that we still have a \nwindow where we can act decisively and effectively.\n\nA legally binding agreement that sets a course for \nincreases of no more than 2\u00b0C is achievable, but all \ncountries, large or small, must make it happen. It is not a \nsubject that we can leave aside to take up later, to debate \nat a later date. We call on all partners to ensure that \nthe upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nwhich will meet in Lima, sets the stage for concluding \na meaningful and legally binding agreement in Paris in \n2015.\n\nI would also like to reiterate the importance \nof fulfilling commitments to jointly mobilize \nover $100 billion annually by 2020 for the full \noperationalization of the Green Climate Fund, which \n\n\nshould be capitalized as soon as possible. I also \nunderline the importance of ensuring that the most \nvulnerable, in particular SIDS and African nations, \nhave access to the appropriate resources as quickly \nas possible. Further, we call for SIDS to be part of the \ndecision-makers on issues of climate change and to be \nallocated a permanent seat on the Executive Committee \nof the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and \nDamage associated with Climate Change Impacts.\n\nSeychelles will also continue to advocate for a \nsolution to the debt trap in which many of us, especially \nSIDS, find ourselves. A solution that Seychelles \nhas brought forward in partnership with the Nature \nConservancy, an international non-governmental \norganization, is proposals for debt-for-adaptation \nswaps. SIDS are often constrained in their development \nbecause of large debt-to-GDP ratios. Transferring \nthat debt into climate change adaptation projects \nwill address the SIDS need for greater flexibility in \naddressing their development challenges while also \nmaking a real impact in terms of building climate \nchange resilience by creating marine protected areas, \nnot only locally, but globally. That concept will also \nallow for the application of climate change funding in \norder to achieve leverage for adaptation projects while \nreducing financial barriers for small island developing \nStates.\n\n(spoke in French)\nFaced with the challenges of security, transnational \ncrime and extremism, the United Nations requires \nsignificant reform and must rise above its divisions \nto help build a world in which human beings can live, \nwherever they are, in dignity and free from want and \nfear. More than ever, it is necessary to encourage the \nsearch for collective solutions to address all sorts of \nphenomenon that undermine the balance of our world.\n\nThat is the sense that guides every action of \nmy country. Seychelles is indeed ready to meet the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century in a spirit of \nopenness and dialogue with all peoples, for a world \nof peace and human brotherhood. We are working in \nAfrica, particularly in the Indian Ocean, with a view to \nthe region becoming one of shared peaceful, democratic \nand prosperous development.\n\nThe Indian Ocean region is grateful to the United \nNations, and the Seychelles once again thanks its \nspecialized agencies, as well as our various partners, for \nthe invaluable role each one has played and still plays in \nthe fight against maritime piracy, which has already had \na deep impact on our development plans. Statistics show \nthat today maritime piracy has declined, but that hardly \nindicates that that threat has disappeared. Therefore, \nwe must remain vigilant, and we still need the support \nof all to help dispel the profound aftereffects it has left \nfor our economy. Over the years, maritime piracy has \nhad serious repercussions on fishing, tourism, shipping \nand port services. Seychelles continues to work in \nharmony with all its partners, since any slackening in \nthe face of that unpredictable phenomenon could have \nconsequences.\n\nThe Seychelles is actively involved with partners \nin our region and beyond to better target organizers \nof cross-border trafficking in the Indian Ocean zone. \nWe have established a regional information centre that \nallows better coordination between our region\u2019s forces \nand also aims to better manage the monitoring and \nprotecting of our shared maritime space against the \nshared threats, whether piracy, narcotics trafficking or \nillegal fishing.\n\nIn the same vein, the Seychelles will continue to \nsupport the Security Council decision to strengthen \nthe United Nations-African Union partnership in \nSomalia. It is a difficult task, for which I wish to \naffirm our solidarity with the African and United \nNations staff involved. I take the opportunity to urge \nthe international community to continue supporting \nefforts to restore peace and reconciliation in Somalia. \nThe international community must not lose patience \nin view of the mixed results achieved so far. For our \npart, we have taken action bilaterally and with regional \nand multilateral partners to help Somalia strengthen its \ncapacities in areas such as fisheries management and \ndevelopment. The United Nations must always show the \nway and inspire the necessary efforts to bring together \nthe means necessary in the struggle and to coordinate \nthem with the States concerned.\n\nSeychelles also expresses solidarity with all \nAfrican countries affected by conflict or instability. \nWe are committed to working together so that we can \nbuild together, in the African Union, the transformative \nAfrica that we foresee through our 2063 strategy.\n\nSeychelles, like all African countries, also \nexpresses solidarity with the Palestinian people, given \nthe challenges of the continuing conflict in the Middle \nEast, and we reiterate our wish for peace between the \ntwo neighbouring States based on the 1967 borders.\n\n\n\nWe also take the opportunity to recall the \nimportance of lifting the economic embargo against \nCuba, an island country that depends on trade access to \nbetter support its development, as all island States do.\n\nAll those problems and challenges justify the United \nNations remaining the leaven of international peace \nand security, but also and especially the conscience \nof humanity. Here I commend the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his remarkable work at the head \nof our Organization at a time when human history is \nfacing enormous challenges. Indeed, much remains to \nbe done, but optimism remains, for the helm is in good \nhands. The United Nations will effectively discharge its \nmission if all the nations that gave rise to it, large and \nsmall, provide it with the necessary means and entrust \nit with the responsibility for carrying out actions in the \nservice of humanity. Seychelles, for its part, remains \nready to play its role to its full capacity, in this noble \nand exciting mission.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you \nwarmly, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, and to \nassure you that the Tongan delegation will fully support \nthe crucial work ahead under your able leadership. I \nwould also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. John \nAshe, for his sterling conduct of the previous session, \nespecially his championing of issues relating to small \nisland developing States (SIDS). And I pay tribute to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exemplary \nstewardship in advancing the commitment of the United \nNations to building a more peaceful and prosperous \nworld amid the diverse and complex issues it faces \ntoday.\n\nMy delegation and I welcome the theme of this \nyear\u2019s general debate, \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, \nand we look forward to the three high-level thematic \ndebates and the high-level event to be held next year. \nAs we work together to formulate a historic post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, we are cognizant that we must be \nambitious and transformative in our approach in order \nto ensure tangible benefits for our people. Responsive \naccess to financial resources is essential if we are to \ncement the adoption of a meaningful development \nagenda and its full implementation.\n\nTonga supports the consensus that the report of \nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals should be integrated into the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, with a global commitment to \neradicating poverty by 2030. The proposed sustainable \ndevelopment goals on oceans, seas and marine \nresources and climate change are woven intimately \nand intricately into the fabric of the very survival of \nPacific small island developing States. Without them, \nour joint aspirations for sustainable development and \neconomic growth will not be achieved, and we will \nbe left behind. The Small Island Developing States \nAccelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, known as \nthe Samoa Pathway outcome document, was endorsed \nby SIDS leaders and their partners earlier this month. It \nis a blueprint for the sustainable development of small \nisland developing States for the next decade and should \ntherefore be integrated into the form and substance of \nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nIn order to guarantee harmony in our implementation \nof the development agenda, Tonga agrees that each \ncountry should take primary responsibility for its \nown economic growth, social development and \n\nenvironmental sustainability. However, that can be \nfulfilled only with the active engagement of all relevant \nstakeholders through genuine and durable partnerships. \nWe look forward to working together towards the \nsummit in September 2015 when Heads of State and \nGovernment will adopt a post-2015 development \nagenda that will be inclusive and people-centred. It \nwill be a historic event, adding further meaning to the \ncelebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United \nNations.\n\nThis year, the Pacific island leaders endorsed the \nPalau Declaration on \u201cThe Ocean: Life & Future\u201d, \nwhich is concerned with charting a course to \nsustainability. Tonga is a joint custodian of the Pacific \nOcean, whose natural resources form the bedrock of \neconomic, social and environmental development in the \nPacific islands. The well-being of the Tongan people \nis therefore premised on the sustainable development, \nmanagement and conservation of the ocean and its \nresources. The management of seabed exploration and \nexploitation is an important facet of Tonga\u2019s interests \nin the oceans, and we have worked diligently through \nthe relevant institutions established under the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \nto ensure that activity within the area located in the \nPacific Ocean is managed appropriately for the benefit \nof humankind.\n\nFor the first time, Tonga sought election to a seat \non the relevant body established under UNCLOS, the \nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority, and \nwas elected by acclamation by its member States. \nThis year, Tonga passed legislation related to seabed \nmining activities within Tonga\u2019s jurisdiction and under \nthe provisions of UNCLOS. We joined our Pacific \nIsland neighbours in supporting the call for launching \nnegotiations by September 2015 on an international \nagreement under UNCLOS on the management and \nconservation of the ocean and its resources, both within \nour national jurisdiction and in areas beyond.\n\nTonga commends the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative \nin convening the recent Climate Summit as a forum \nfor world leaders to deliver bold announcements on \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation. In the spirit \nof sustaining international cooperation, we support the \nurgent call for States to address the adverse impacts \nof climate change. The collective response will depend \non the outcome of the ongoing negotiations being \nconducted through the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. Nevertheless, it should \nbe based on the principles of equity and common \nbut differentiated responsibility, as enshrined in the \nConvention. The principles and overall objective \nespoused by the Convention must be fully observed \nif the threat of climate change is to be effectively \naddressed and overcome for our common benefit.\n\nThe Global Risks Report 2013 ranked Tonga as \nthe second most vulnerable country in the world to \nnatural disasters. That vulnerability was demonstrated \nby our first category-5 cyclone earlier this year, \nwhich devastated our central island group, displacing \nthousands and resulting in millions of dollars\u2019 worth \nof damage. However, and fortunately, it caused only \none fatality. Today, that same central island group is \nexperiencing an unseasonable drought. Tonga has \nused a whole-of-country approach \u2014 through its joint \nnational action plan on climate-change adaptation and \ndisaster-risk management \u2014 to establish a base from \nwhich to move forward with adaptation measures. In \nterms of mitigation, we are gradually reducing our \nfossil-fuel consumption.\n\nTonga applauds the convening of the high-level \nevent on combating climate change, and it would like to \nrecall here that Pacific island countries were among the \nfirst to raise the alarm on the implications of climate \nchange for security, both regionally and generally. In \nthat regard, we support the call to the Security Council \nto reconsider its stance and to recognize the links \nbetween climate change and international peace and \nsecurity. We also support the call to the Secretary-\nGeneral to appoint a special representative on climate \nand security to research those links and report back to \nMember States.\n\nTonga associates itself with those Member States \nthat have appealed for a meaningful approach, going \nbeyond the rhetoric, to reforming the Security Council \nthrough an intergovernmental process in order to make \nit more representative and inclusive. We also support \nthe request of Heads of State and Government in the \n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 55/2) that \nits goals include the important work of revitalizing \nthe General Assembly. That general reform process \nmust continue if we are to ensure greater efficiency, \nrepresentativeness and transparency throughout the \nUnited Nations system as a whole, thereby enabling this \ngreat institution to be better prepared to respond to the \nrealities we live with today.\n\nFinally, for future generations to live in a better \nworld, we must work harmoniously to fulfil our \n\nresponsibilities and ask the Almighty to guide us \nthrough our growing challenges."

        "file_text": "At \nthe end of the twentieth century, we imagined that the \ntwenty-first century would bring greater progress and \npeace for all and that it would be free of the tragedies \nthat had convulsed the world. Indeed, we have seen \nhopeful signs of development in many dimensions. Yet \nparadoxically, we see all around us the symptoms of \ncrises that, while they may be more localized, have \nmore devastating humanitarian consequences. These \nchallenges include regional wars, ethnic and religious \ntensions, humanitarian crises, the trampling of human \nrights, the break-up of several States, climate change, \ndeepening inequality, cross-border terrorism and the \nspread of terrible pandemics such as Ebola, all of \nwhich require a firm, urgent response on the part of the \ninternational community.\n\nThat instability, along with a lack of social \ncohesion, poses a threat to peace, security, human \nrights, development and democracy. This affects not \nonly countries or States, but the actual men and women \nwho inhabit them. In other words, it is a threat to all we \nbelieve in \u2014 everything that constitutes the basis of the \nagreement on which the United Nations was founded \nand everything that is our raison d\u2019\u00eatre as leaders of \nour societies. That is why the United Nations remains \nirreplaceable as an institution for addressing global \nchallenges and for agreeing on the actions needed to \nresolve them, even if some of those actions have not \nproduced the desired results.\n\nThe Security Council has contributed to addressing \nand preventing crises. One response has been the \ndesign of robust peacekeeping operations with a strong \nemphasis on the protection of civilians. However, on \nmany occasions Council members have been unable \nto act with unity. That undoubtedly undermines the \n\n\nlegitimacy and credibility of the principal organ \nresponsible for international peace and security.\n\nThis year has seen a significant rise in the number \nof humanitarian crises around the world, in particular \nin the number of complex emergencies with regional \nimpacts that indirectly affect already-fragile States. We \nare concerned about the 3 million refugees created by \nthe crisis in Syria; about the actions of terrorist groups \nsuch as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant; about the \ncruel violence that the world has witnessed in Gaza. We \nexpress our solidarity with the victims and categorically \ncondemn the use of violence. Any action in this area \nmust be taken within the context of international law. \nWe believe that the international community should \nseek political solutions and inclusive negotiations \nto facilitate action by the Security Council. For our \npart, we are prepared to increase our humanitarian \ncommitments and shall consider accepting refugees \nfrom those conflict zones.\n\nWe are also concerned about the situation in \nUkraine. Here the position of Chile is clear. We \nbelieve that the principle of territorial integrity must \nbe respected and that, at the same time, the rights of \nminorities must be protected. We believe that a solution \ncan be found to prevent an escalation of violence, \nsanctions and tensions that may well spread throughout \nthe planet.\n\nGenerally speaking, we wish to reaffirm our belief \nin the need to respect the integrity of State borders. \nInternational law is clear and unambiguous. Any \naction designed to affect existing boundary treaties \ncreates room for legal uncertainty and could jeopardize \ninternational peace and stability. In that context, we \ncontinue to believe that reform of the Security Council \nis a pending issue requiring political decision and swift \naction. We reiterate our support for the enlargement of \nthe Council and for the aspirations of Germany, Brazil, \nJapan and India to become permanent members. In \naddition, Chile favours a serious debate on the French \nproposal to limit the right to veto in the case of crimes \ninvolving the responsibility to protect.\n\nWe acknowledge the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to \nachieve a more inclusive global governance in which \nthe post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable \ndevelopment goals occupy a central place and require \nthe political support of Governments and societies in \nall regions. The post-2015 process provides a great \nopportunity to tackle the social and development \nissues common to all societies and regions, using \na comprehensive approach, through specific and \nmeasurable goals. Women and peace and security is an \nitem on the agenda of the Security Council to which \nChile, as a member of the Council, attaches priority. \nSince the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), the world \nhas made progress in the protection of women and girls \nin armed conflicts.\n\nOur efforts to empower women and promote \ninitiatives to combat violence against women and girls \nhave been tireless. Thanks to those efforts, today women \nare at the centre of the new development and peace \narchitecture. We believe that the full incorporation \nof women in every area of society \u2014 including the \neconomy, politics, and culture \u2014 is a prerequisite for \ntheir full development. It, therefore, should also be a \npriority in the post-2015 development agenda, as should \nearly childhood development, which is something that \nhas to do with the future of our societies.\n\nI come from Latin America, a region of \nmiddle-income countries that has its own dreams, \nchallenges and tasks. For us, sustainable development, \nsecurity, the quality of governance and, above all, \ninequality and social cohesion are the most pressing \nproblems. We want those challenges to appear in the \npost-2015 development agenda, which must be inclusive \nand reflect the situation in all regions of the world.\n\nWe believe that inequality is one of the greatest \nthreats to countries\u2019 development and international \nsecurity. It fosters social unrest and prevents us all \nfrom moving towards inclusive development and \nending exclusion and poverty, which in turn can lead \nto resentment and violence. Therefore, overcoming \ninequality, with its many faces, must occupy a central \nplace among the post-2015 development goals. We also \nbelieve that the United Nations system should have the \ntools for measuring specific progress in a universal \nagenda to combat inequality.\n\nChile is dealing with the challenge of inequality \ndecisively and over the long term. Today in Chile, there \nis a common belief in the need for change \u2014 change \nspecifically designed to substantially improve equity \nand inclusion. Having made great progress, Chile would \nlike to consolidate and move ahead but recognizes that a \nsociety that has undergone profound and rapid changes \nfaces new challenges.\n\nPublic opinion and political evolution tell us that \nthe time has come to take meaningful steps through \n\n\nsubstantive reforms providing the essential basis \nfor moving towards a more dynamic, inclusive and \nequitable development. That is a basic condition for \nmoving towards a better society for all. To that end, we \nhave recently adopted a tax reform to ensure greater \nequity, fiscal sustainability and the resources necessary \nto carry out an education reform that will ensure a \nquality education, free of charge, and opportunities for \nall. Chile will not achieve development while dragging \nthe burden of inequality. We all know that, which is \nwhy the tax reform has received cross-cutting support.\n\nWe are also introducing long-awaited political \nreforms to enhance our democracy and institutional \nlegitimacy. We have already adopted a law allowing \nChileans residing abroad to vote. Progress is being made \non the reform to alter the electoral system by eliminating \nthe existing bias and motivating citizens to participate, \nsince now every vote will count. And we want to move \ntowards a new Constitution with fully democratic \nfoundations and content. We launched a productivity \nand growth agenda to stimulate the economy, promote \nsustainable development and create decent jobs, as a \nbasic prerequisite for achieving a lasting reduction in \ninequality and enhancing opportunities. Ultimately, we \nwant to broaden the scope of rights to bring them into \nline with our enhanced capability as a country.\n\nClimate change exacerbates inequalities and \nintensifies threats. There is a collective duty to act, \nand Chile is convinced that Latin America has a big \ncontribution to make in this debate. Climate change \naggravates inequalities because it has the greatest \nimpact on the most vulnerable. Chile has only a marginal \neffect on the problem, since it accounts for only 0.25 per \ncent of carbon emissions, but it undoubtedly suffers the \nconsequences of climate change, as do many others. \nTherefore, we want to be part of the solution. Since \nwe understand that this entails a global commitment, \ndifferentiated actions and binding obligations, we \nvoluntarily made a commitment to reduce our emissions \nby 20 per cent by 2020. Several other Latin American \ncountries have made similar voluntary commitments. \nWe should like to propose here that there be some type \nof accountability, which would facilitate compliance \nand would help to set an example for the countries that \nare lagging behind.\n\nThe Organization must ensure the efficiency and \nconsistency of multilateralism as a special forum \nfor tackling the major global issues in an inclusive \nmanner, creating international regimes and promoting \ncooperation arrangements in priority areas for our \npeoples. Our country trusts multilateralism, and \nwe believe that participating in the system involves \nboth rights and responsibilities. Because we want to \ncontribute to the solution of global problems, we are a \nmember of the Security Council and the Human Rights \nCouncil, we aspire to membership in the Economic \nand Social Council, and we are contributing to \npeacekeeping operations, including the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti. That Mission, in which \na number of Latin American countries are engaged, is \na tangible action of solidarity to support the democratic \nconsolidation of a sister country.\n\nWe believe, therefore, that it is a political imperative \nto strengthen multilateralism in three fundamental \nways. The first is by enhancing the Secretary-General\u2019s \nability to take initiatives. In the context of the functions \nenvisaged in the Charter, it is essential to continue \nsupport for the political leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral to take preventive action and respond to urgent \nsituations that jeopardize the dignity of people and \ninternational peace and security.\n\nThe second relates to fieldwork. The ability of the \nsystem to take action in the field is a basic prerequisite \nin order for the Organization to be relevant to people\u2019s \ndemands and real problems. As the former Executive \nDirector of UN-Women, I had the privilege of seeing the \nconviction, solidarity and dedication with which United \nNations staff help to promote the ideals, principles and \nmandates of the system.\n\nThe third area of focus is development and \ncooperation. The process of constructing a post-\n2015 development agenda requires renewed efforts to \nprovide official development assistance and to promote \ninnovative financing mechanisms, encouraging \npartnerships between countries, international bodies, \ncivil society and the private sector.\n\nChile is interested in a greater coordination of \ninitiatives and instruments to facilitate South-South \ncooperation between middle-income countries while \nseeking out ways in which their essential contribution \ncan be made effective. I would also like to note that \nin Chile we have enacted legal provisions to open our \neconomy fully to imports from the 48 least developed \ncountries, without duties or quotas.\n\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the irrevocable \ncommitments made by Chile\u2019s successive democratic \nGovernments to the work of the United Nations. Those \n\n\ncommitments reflect universal principles and values, as \nthey promote the protection, dignity and fundamental \nrights of all individuals and contribute to crisis \nprevention, dialogue, reconciliation and post-conflict \nmanagement. Our convictions and efforts will always \nbe aimed at enhancing the legitimacy of collective \naction to meet people\u2019s concerns and demands. We \nbelieve that, with an effective and real effort on the \npart of the international community, we will be able \nto deal successfully with exceptional crises and, first \nand foremost, build a world in which all inhabitants live \ntogether in peace and dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "In September \n2000, before becoming an independent country and \nwhile under the administration of the United Nations \nTransitional Administration in East Timor, we came \nto the General Assembly as observers in order to \nfamiliarize ourselves with the grand designs for the new \ncentury, in the form of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Twelve years after Timor-Leste was \nadmitted into this prestigious Organization, here we \nare again to take part in a review of what has been done \nand of what has not been done, looking at reasons and \nimpacts.\n\nUltimately we want to revise the Assembly\u2019s \nmanner of operation and redefine plans and strategies. \nHowever, other speeches made both here and at the \nSecurity Council open debate yesterday (S/PV.7272) \nshow the other face \u2014 the more troubling one \u2014 of world \nproblems, which is the general unquietness of spirit and \nthe pressure to use force in order to punish. I therefore \nadd my voice to all those who spoke before me in \nstating my deep concern about the particularly difficult \ntime in which the community of nations is living. The \nUnited Nations has been the unassailable forum for \napproaching international issues and continues to be \nthe hope of millions of people throughout the world.\n\nIn the year 2000, the challenges came from the \ncondition of extreme poverty, educational deficits, \nenormous scarcity in terms of doctors and medication \nand lack of food production that affected the populations \nof many underdeveloped countries. Fourteen years \nlater, little has been achieved despite the effort of the \ncommunity of nations. Fragile or conflict-affected \ncountries are the furthest from achieving the MDGs. \nWorse still, the challenges of the year 2000 have taken \non a new path, with an increase in problems related to \nthe rise of tensions and conflicts in many parts of the \nworld.\n\nThe Organization\u2019s true greatness and its global \nleadership ability are measured in difficult times such \nas these, where the search for peaceful solutions through \nmore intense dialogue may well determine the future \nof humankind. In order to respond to the challenges, \nwe need an Organization that operates effectively. \nWe need an Organization that is more active and \nless stereotyped \u2014 an Organization that strengthens \ncooperation with other organizations, particularly \nregional ones, and that acts with great respect for the \nsovereignty and the particularities of each State.\n\nEvery action carried out so far has just been a \ncontinuation of past measures that, in most cases, \nfailed to achieve results that can be considered positive. \nWe are witnessing an increasing loss of trust and we \nare faced with a crisis of values. More than trying to \ngrasp the nature of the issues that are causing us to \nreact, we must seek to understand the true causes of \nthe problems. When faced with a threat that does not \nrespect borders and that jeopardizes our commitment \ntowards tolerance and peace, it is vital that we better \nunderstand the interconnectedness of problems, so as \nto locate the civility gap that prevents us from talking \nto each other and from finding consensus.\n\nWe have always advocated the view that the use \nof military force does not establish universal values \nor build democracies. Misguided approaches that \nfail to recognize the various and diverse elements of \nthreats or, worse still, that are based on contradictions \nand conflicts of interest, only serve to fuel the fire of \nradicalism and extremist actions. Accordingly, we must \nreflect and think things over, because as they stand, we \nare merely sliding into the darkness of war, upholding \nthe ancient principle of \u201can eye for an eye, a tooth for \na tooth\u201d.\n\nThat is why I reiterate to the General Assembly \nthat our collective efforts to preserve world peace \nand security must reject ill-conceived plans that are \nonly motivated by the strategic interests of the large \nPowers and their will to dominate. Instead, we need a \nplan that is more suited to the reality of each situation \nand that provides a true response to the main causes \nof the current crisis. This common agenda should not \nmanipulate facts to produce collective reactions, but \nrather admit past mistakes related to the urge to impose \n\npeace through war. Only by correcting our way of \nthinking and acting will we truly be giving peace a \nchance.\n\nThe responses to the crises faced by humankind \nshould not be weakened by the desire to end war by \nwaging war. Instead, they must be based on the desire \nto build a world of peace, supported by dialogue and by \nan effort \u2014 herculean, if need be \u2014 to respond to the \nroot causes of problems that lead to terrorism, racism, \nextremism and intolerance. When dozens of millions \nof people throughout the world suffer the horrors of \nconflict and the countless abuses perpetrated in this \ncentury of globalization, the actions by the international \ncommunity should give priority to the establishment \nof the best mechanisms for resolving the problems \nof exclusion, discrimination and marginalization of \ngroups, sects and ethnicities.\n\nWe must also ensure, from the very start, that the \nsocieties emerging from the ashes of those conflicts and \ncommitted to leaving the memories of the past behind \nare entitled to a vital transitional period with respect to \ntheir behaviours, their ways of thinking and acting, and \ntheir own internal rules and commitments. Otherwise, \nwe will just be sowing the seeds for new conflicts that \nwe may end up reaping later on. The war in Iraq, which \nhas destroyed the legacy of a centuries-old civilization, \nand the bloody conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria \nand Ukraine, should make the international community \ndraw its conclusions about the international standards \napplied in those contexts. The uncertainty and the \nbloody anguish that surround Israel and Palestine, \nwith those two peoples destined to live side by side, \nshould alert us once and for all to the fact that fear and \ninsecurity for the future lead to hate, which is the root \nof all evils.\n\nTimor-Leste knows only too well the consequences \nand the scars of war. In addition to the hundreds of \nthousands of Timorese killed, we also witnessed the \nnear-complete destruction of our country. A State \nborn without the ability to ensure and promote the \nfundamental rights and liberties of its citizens is a \nfragile State that is unable to carry out its main mission.\n\nImmediately after the war, we started to reconcile \nTimorese society. We wanted to achieve peace, since \nwithout peace we could not feel free. We have also \nembraced Indonesia in order to achieve true and \ngenuine reconciliation. Instead of feeding hatred \nand vengeance, we nurtured solidarity and tolerance \nbetween our communities. In that manner, we cultivated \na sound relationship of cooperation between our States \nand our peoples.\n\nWestern democracies are prone to paying for costly \ninternational tribunals for judging genocides. They also \ntend to feel shocked by the human rights violations that \noccur in developing countries. The issue with Indonesia \ncannot be seen only in terms of the actions by its \nmilitary and its generals. Instead, it must be seen within \na broader perspective, in which the Governments of the \nWestern Powers sold sophisticated weapons like rifles, \nwarships, fighters, ammunition, tanks and cannons to \nthe Indonesian military, in addition to providing it with \ntraining, so that it could decimate the Timorese. That is \nwhy we Timorese and Indonesians preferred instead to \nrecord the truth of the facts, to close this painful chapter \nin our past and to look to the future, which required and \ncontinues to require much effort to develop both nations \nand improve the living conditions of both peoples.\n\nWith its pluralistic and tolerant society, Indonesia is \nmore than a close neighbour. Indeed, it is an inspiration \nfor Timor-Leste. Under the wise leadership of President \nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono, we have witnessed the \nestablishment of a modern democracy that harmonizes \nprogress with the promotion of national, regional \nand international peace. We sincerely hope that the \npeaceful transition to President Joko Widodo will \nbring more success to that great nation. And I say this \nin a year when Timor-Leste is celebrating the twelfth \nanniversary of its independence.\n\n\nWe have learned from our weaknesses and today \nwe are living in an atmosphere of social and political \npeace. We are very familiar with the challenges that \nare inherent in the efforts of developing a nation and \nof building peace and security. We are very thankful \nfor the support that the United Nations and all donor \ncountries have provided to Timor-Leste. Nevertheless, \nthe years of partnership have also taught us important \nlessons, which we have been sharing with the world, \nparticularly the fragile States. We are encouraging them \nto take ownership of their processes and be committed \nto the future of their citizens.\n\nWe have also started to be more internationally \nactive. We have been working hard within the scope of \nthe Group of Seven Plus, a group that brings together 20 \nfragile and conflict-affected countries. In addition to \nsharing experiences and knowledge and seeking to put \n\nthe needs of those countries on the global development \nagenda, we continue repeating, as many leaders have \nbeen doing since yesterday, that without peace there \ncan be no development. In turn, without development \nthere can be no room for democratic transition, since \ndemocracy is a dynamic process of assimilating \nprinciples and values, rather than a process to be \nmeasured by elections alone.\n\nAnd that brings us to the subject of the general debate \nat this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly \u2014 the \npost-2015 development agenda. Inequality is increasing \ndangerously throughout the world, with wealth being \nconcentrated in the hands of a few to the detriment of \nus all. Even after the world learned of the greed and \nthe corruption of the international financial system that \nled to the global financial crisis, we are now seeing \nhow the faltering economic recovery is benefiting only \nthose who were responsible for the financial meltdown \nin the first place. Despite the best efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his team at the United Nations, \nwe are almost in 2015 and know that 2.2 billion people \nthroughout the world are already in or are entering the \nranks of the extreme poor, without even knowing what \nthe Millennium Development Goals are.\n\nIn that regard, I must draw attention to the incorrect \npractice on the part of international organizations to \nview each of the 193 States Members of the United \nNations in the same manner, regardless of whether they \nare large or small, rich or poor, young or in a transitional \nperiod or centuries-old, developed, with emerging \neconomies, or underdeveloped. And these development \nindices create scales of values that are both unfair and \ndemotivating to the majority of the least developed \ncountries. Accordingly, all of us in attendance here \ntoday have a historic opportunity to share our thoughts \non the enormous challenges ahead of us, so as to outline \na truly transformative agenda in which no country is \nleft behind.\n\nHowever, the issue that deserves our collective \nattention and requires urgent measures is the mitigation \nof the environmental threats that continue to increase and \nare hindering the legitimate perspectives of emerging \nand developing countries. Fortunately, yesterday\u2019s \nsummit on climate change raised expectations in \nrelation to actual action plans being implemented \nin some countries. The plans will be expanded to \nthe global level next year in Paris. Some developed \ncountries have also committed to providing capital \nto the Adaptation Fund, which is vitally important to \ndeveloping countries. Ms. Emilia Pires, the Minister \nof Finance of Timor-Leste, was a member of the high-\nlevel panel that advised the Secretary-General on that \nagenda.\n\nIn 2013 and until August, Timor-Leste had the \nhonour of assuming the presidency of the sixty-ninth \nsession of the Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP). As such, we had the \nprivilege of presiding over the session for one year \nand working with ESCAP and the nations of the Asia-\nPacific region in order to achieve progress and improve \nhuman development. Timor-Leste is committed to that \nnoble ideal and to that deserving mission of helping to \nnurture a culture of peace in our region through the \ngradual and persistent reduction of social inequalities \nwithin each country and among countries.\n\nHowever, in our region, including within the \nscope of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \ncountries are cooperating and promoting peace, \nwhich has enabled the rise of the Asian region, led by \nChina, and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of \npoverty. However, we cannot but be concerned by the \ndevelopments in the East and South China Sea.\n\nThat brings us to a key issue that is of vital \nimportance to Timor-Leste. I am speaking of the need \nto set maritime borders between countries in a clear and \nserious manner, in line with international law. Back in \n2002, when we began to walk our own path in freedom, \nwe saw a globalized world in which the arrogance of the \npowerful and the ambition of the rich, who prey upon \nthe inexperience and ignorance of the poor and the \nweak to act dishonestly and in bad faith, prevailed, as \na serious insult to universal values. And I must affirm \nthat big multinationals have always played an improper \nand disloyal role, acting dishonestly and in bad faith \nwhen dealing with poor countries.\n\nTimor-Leste, a young, small and poor country, \nwas caught off guard in that sophisticated culture of \nmanipulation and deceit. Nevertheless, we want to \ncontinue believing that international mechanisms, such \nas the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \ncontribute to justice between nations and understanding \nbetween peoples, so as to defend sovereign rights and \nthe truth.\n\nToday, those commitments are vital in order to \nstart rebuilding trust in the world system and to prevent \ntensions from increasing. The strengthening of dialogue \nand tolerance and the promotion of a new diplomacy \n\n\nmust be translated from a set of good intentions into \nactual deeds in the international arena. But what is truly \nintriguing is the fact that no decent country has yet \nadvocated the need to carry out inquiries to determine \nthe origin of the weapons used to massacre civilians, \nparticularly those used to kill women and children, \nso as to identify the true beneficiaries of the world \ncrisis \u2014 those who are selling weapons to uncontrolled \ngangs throughout the world.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to inform the \nAssembly that this year, Timor-Leste has assumed \nthe rotating presidency of the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). In that forum, \nwe want to use diplomacy and cooperation to nurture \nour joint economic potential by making use of our \nregional ties. We also want to spread a message of \npeace, human rights and social justice throughout all \nthe forums in which we are represented.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a member of that community and \na country with which Timor-Leste has been closely \ninvolved, including within the scope of the Group of \nSeven Plus, particularly once Timor-Leste realized that \nGuinea-Bissau had been left to its fate at the mercy of \ninternational sanctions. After a devastating cycle of \ncoups, we felt that the people of Guinea-Bissau needed \npeace and stability, and we saw how their leaders were \nstriving to achieve a collective commitment that would \nbenefit the people and the country.\n\nTimor-Leste had the honour of providing financial \nsupport and of sending a technical team to provide \nassistance throughout the entire electoral process in \nGuinea-Bissau. That process, which involved massive \ndemocratic participation, was a success and restored \nconstitutional order in the country. Still, as we all know, \nelections are but a starting point, and a State without \nthe means to ensure the basic needs of its people faces \ncountless challenges that can jeopardize the promise of \npeace and national cohesion.\n\nIn line with the subject of the debate in the General \nAssembly, I must say that it is now urgent to create \nthe conditions to enable Guinea-Bissau to move from \nfragility to resilience by supporting its State agencies. \nGuinea-Bissau needs to restore its public administration \nand its State agencies, as well as to reform its defence and \nsecurity sector by modernizing its forces. Furthermore, \nGuinea-Bissau requires a financial boost in order to \njump-start its economy.\n\nWithin the scope of the CPLP, we want to have \nactive collaboration with the authorities of Guinea-\nBissau and with its international partners, namely the \nEconomic Community of West African States, so as \nto hold an international conference on aid to Guinea-\nBissau as soon as possible. The conference should start \nby focusing on matters of extreme urgency, such as \nsalaries, food, security, fuel and health. Timor-Leste \nhas already contributed $6 million, which corresponds \nto one month of public-sector salaries in the country. \nI also urge every country in attendance to join Timor-\nLeste and the CPLP countries, in keeping with the \nhighest values of international solidarity, in supporting \nthe consolidation of the achievements made so far by \nthe people of Guinea-Bissau. Indeed, that is something \nthat will also convey a promise of peace to the entire \nAfrican continent.\n\nAnd I cannot talk about Africa \u2014 a continent \nthat is already wounded on the inside and ravaged by \nhunger and poverty \u2014 without mentioning the scourge \nof the Ebola virus, which is presently challenging the \ninternational health system itself. That epidemic, which \nis unprecedented in our time, requires a vital and urgent \ncommitment by the international community. This \nmorning in the Ebola campaign I found out that Timor-\nLeste will provide $1 million as immediate support \nwithin the spirit of solidarity that guides the Group of \nSeven Plus, which includes Sierra Leone, Liberia and \nGuinea-Conakry. Next year we will also be allocating \nan equal amount to help fight the epidemic.\n\nThe great challenge in today\u2019s world is liberating \npeople from fear. I am talking about the fear of \ndifference, insecurity, hunger, poverty and disease, the \nfear of losing power or the fear of becoming a slave to \npower. In today\u2019s unbalanced and unequal world, we \nneed to have the courage to speak a language of trust \nand tranquillity. We need to pacify minds, encourage \ndialogue and free people from doubt and feelings of \ninjustice so that they acquire greater tolerance and \ngreater respect for differences and diversity. We need \nto free people from the yoke of poverty and from the \ndeplorable conditions in which they are living so as to \nensure their right to development. We still have time \nto write a different and more humane tale for today\u2019s \ngeneration and future generations.\n\nTimor-Leste wants to make an active contribution \nto a better world, where each country may live in \ntolerance, harmony and tranquillity within a true \natmosphere of friendship and solidarity that promotes \n\npeace. Such peace must start in the minds and behaviours \nof the people at every level of society, so that they can \nhave a positive influence on the policies of the global \ncentres of decision-making. That is the only way for us \nto believe that the baby from the Marshall Islands who \ntouched all our hearts two days ago may be certain that \nher future is guaranteed and that she will be able to live \nin those small islands that make up her country.\n"

        "file_text": "The year \n2014 is a special one for Europeans \u2014 a special year \nof commemoration. In the summer 100 years ago, \nEuropean diplomacy failed and the world slid into the \nFirst World War. Seventy-five years ago, Germany \nattacked its neighbour Poland, plunging the world into \nthe Second World War. Twenty-five years ago, the \nBerlin Wall fell, bringing an end to the world\u2019s decades-\nlong division into East and West.\n\nHowever, merely to look back and remember would \nnot be enough in this year of commemoration. On the \ncontrary, we must ask ourselves: what have we learned \nfor the future? The most important lesson learned \nfrom that history was the establishment of the United \nNations, for the United Nations embodies the world\u2019s \nhope for peace. That hope derives from an idea which \nis as simple as it is revolutionary: there is peace when \nthe world sets rules for itself and replaces the law of \nforce with the force of law, when conflicts are resolved \nat the negotiating table and not on the battlefield, when \nthe world renounces, step by step, the cynical logic of \nviolence.\n\nTo date, the United Nations has provided a universal \nfoundation for the hope for peace. But that universality \nis under threat from the ghosts of the past and from new \ndemons.\n\nIn 2014 our world seems to be unraveling. Crises are \ncoming at us thick and fast. That is why it is not enough \nsimply to call upon the United Nations. No, we need to \nbreathe life into that call. Hope will remain but a hope, \nan unattainable goal, unless States are prepared to take \non responsibility. The United Nations is not a forum \nonto which we can shrug off responsibility. The United \nNations is a forum whereby we assume responsibility.\n\nGermany, embedded in a united Europe, is prepared \nto take on responsibility in and with the United Nations. \nFirst and foremost we have a responsibility to the people \nbearing the brunt of the suffering in the crises.\n\nNext month Germany will host a conference in \nBerlin to mobilize urgently needed humanitarian \nassistance for the millions of Syrian refugees. My \ncountry will play its part, and I sincerely hope that \nmany others will follow suit. Support is needed above \nall by Syria\u2019s neighbours. They are doing a tremendous \njob but are also under tremendous strain due to the huge \ninflux of displaced persons and refugees from Syria.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic is raging in West Africa. \nIt is bringing suffering and death into the homes of \nindividual families. It is endangering the cohesion \nof entire societies. That is why we are sending \nhumanitarian and medical assistance and setting up an \nairlift to the region. I am delighted that many volunteers \nin my country have responded to the call, saying, \u201cI \nwant to go there to help on the spot\u201d.\n\nAbove and beyond the immediate solidarity, \nhowever, we need a long-term commitment. We need \nthe expertise of the World Health Organization and \nthe coordinating umbrella of the United Nations, \nparticularly in the long term as we try to strengthen \nStates and health-care systems. Germany will contribute \nto both of those goals. We cannot bring the dead back to \nlife, but we may be able to prevent far too many more \npeople dying of Ebola who ought not to be dying if they \nwere treated. And we must certainly make sure that the \nnext epidemic does not have consequences as deadly as \nthe one we are still fighting.\n\nIf we are to move towards the hope of peace, we need \nmany small steps \u2014 the commitment of individuals, \nbilateral diplomacy and regional initiatives. But none \nof that can replace the United Nations. Only the United \nNations can provide a universal foundation for the hope \nof peace. That foundation is international law, to which \neveryone who belongs to the community of nations in \nthe United Nations, and those who want to belong, has \nsubscribed. That is what must be preserved; that is the \ncore of our hope for peace.\n\nThat is why I must here mention the conflict \nin Ukraine. Some people in the Hall may regard it \nas nothing more than a regional conflict in Eastern \nEurope. But I am convinced that that view is incorrect. \nI believe that that conflict affects each and every one of \nus. Not just any State, but a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council \u2014 Russia \u2014 has, with its annexation \nof Crimea, unilaterally altered existing borders in \nEurope and has thus violated international law. We \nmust counter that dangerous sign, because we must not \nallow the power of international law to be eroded from \nthe inside. We must not allow the old divisions between \nEast and West to re-emerge in the United Nations.\n\nBecause so much is at stake in that conflict, not \nonly for the people of Ukraine but also for the future of \ninternational law, Germany and its partners have taken \non responsibility and committed themselves vigorously \nto defusing the conflict. I am under no illusion: a \npolitical solution is still a long way off. However, just a \nfew weeks ago we were on the brink of a direct military \nconfrontation between Russian and Ukrainian armed \nforces. I am happy to say that diplomacy prevented the \nworst. Now the priority must be to bring about a lasting \nceasefire and achieve a political solution, one based on \nthe principles of the United Nations and preserving the \nunity of Ukraine.\n\nI am not discussing only Ukraine. As long as that \nconflict is simmering and as long as Russia and the \nWest are in a dispute over Ukraine, there is a threat \nof paralysing the United Nations. We therefore need a \nSecurity Council that is able and willing to act to tackle \nthe new and, in the long term, far more important tasks \nwe are facing. The world of 2014 is plagued not only by \nthe old ghost of division, but also by new demons.\n\nWe are all shocked by the unspeakable brutality of \nthe terrorists who misuse the name of God in carrying \nout their evil deeds. My question is, ought we not to \nbe particularly worried that the preachers of hate are \ndrawing in young people who have grown up in the \nmidst of our own societies?\n\nThat is why that, too, is not exclusively a regional \nconflict \u2014 a problem in Iraq or in Syria or in Africa, \n\nwhere terrorists are stamping on the fundamental rights \nof women and girls in particular. That barbarity is \ndirected against every one of us, and against everything \nfor which the United Nations stands.\n\nPrecisely for that reason, our response needs \nto go much further than the immediately necessary \nhumanitarian and military response. Germany is \nmaking substantial contributions to both, including \nmilitarily. But all that must be part of a political alliance \nagainst the terror of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \nMy country is strongly committed to that alliance, and \nI very much hope in particular that the societies of the \nMiddle East, realizing that far more is at stake than just \ntheir security, will also join.\n\nIn a world haunted both by old ghosts and new \ndemons, we have to be able to pursue both paths. On the \none hand, we must steadfastly continue to work towards \npolitical solutions in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in \nSyria, but at the same time we must tackle the huge \ntasks of the twenty-first century.\n\nI am referring to the fight against climate change. \nGermany is contributing $1 billion dollars to the Green \nClimate Fund. And we will support our closest partner, \nFrance, on the road to a successful Paris climate summit \nin 2015 and to a universal and legally binding climate \nconvention, which we urgently need.\n\nI am also referring to the digital age. Yes, the \nInternet should be a global, free, open and safe space. \nBut that is not a matter solely for Government agencies \nor big companies. That global, free, open and safe space \nmust be shaped by society as a whole. If we fail to act, \nthe vast technological possibilities will sweep aside the \nhuman dimension. We need an international law for the \ndigital world. Resolution 68/167, which we introduced \ntogether with Brazil, has made a start in that direction, \nI hope, at the United Nations.\n\nI am also referring to the post-2015 agenda, because \nthe fight against poverty begins with asking how we \nactually create value. How do we create prosperity? \nThat question is not only directed at a few countries \nin need of help. Rather, it is a call to the whole world \nfor more sustainable economic activity. With its shift to \nrenewable energies, Germany has set out on a path that, \nalthough not easy, is one the world must take if we want \nto preserve our natural resources and if the fight for \nscarce resources, water and arable land is not to become \nthe major conflict of the twenty-first century.\n\nOur children will judge us by those huge tasks. \nThey will look back, just as we are looking back at \nour forebears in this year of commemoration. Having \nlearned from two World Wars, our forebears established \nthe United Nations as their lesson to us. If we want to \ncontinue that lesson, if we want to master the tasks \nfacing us, then we must further develop this institution. \nThe United Nations is not a finished product. Perhaps it \nwill never be a finished product. It must evolve further, \nso that in all its parts, including the Security Council, it \nreflects today\u2019s world.\n\nI believe that the United Nations is worth every \neffort, for in it lives the world\u2019s hope for peace and a \nlegal order. I assure the Assembly that my country will \nplay its part in making that hope a reality, step by step.\n"

        "file_text": "First, on behalf of the Government of Colombia, I would \nlike to congratulate Mr. Kutesa for his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly and to express \nColombia\u2019s support for his work in promoting a post-\n2015 development agenda that responds to humankind\u2019s \ncurrent challenges. The sustainable development \ngoals recently adopted after an open, transparent and \ninclusive negotiation process should be at the centre of \nthat agenda.\n\nIn a world full of bad news, war, terrorism and \ndisease, I would like to bring a ray of hope to the \nAssembly: that, after more than half a century of \nconflict, Colombia will soon enjoy peace. If we achieve \nthis goal, which Colombians have unsuccessfully \nsought for so long, there is hope for peace anywhere in \nthe world, despite how difficult things may seem right \nnow. Today, I can say to the international community \nthat we are closer than ever before to achieving that \npeace. The process that has been taking place in \nHavana over the past two years with the guerrilla group \nknown as the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de \nColombia (FARC) has been serious, realistic, credible \nand effective and has produced concrete results.\n\nWe agreed on an agenda with five substantive \npoints, of which we have achieved agreements on \nthree: comprehensive rural development, political \nparticipation and the illicit drug problem. In the first \nof those areas, we have agreed to unprecedented \ninvestment in agricultural development, working to \ngive farmers access to land and to generate a better \nstandard of living for farming families. Regarding \npolitical participation, what we are striving for is very \nsimple. We want to broaden our democracy in order \nto build peace and promote citizen participation, and \nto forever sever the link between politics and arms. \nRegarding the illicit drug problem, we have agreed \nto continue dismantling the drug mafia structures, \npromote a national crop substitution and alternative \ndevelopment programme and address the issue of \nconsumption from a public health perspective. The \nagreement also includes a commitment on the part \nof FARC to contributing effectively to a definitive \nsolution to the illicit drug problem and to ending any \nrelationship it may have had with it.\n\nA Colombia without coca and without conflict \nwas an impossible dream just a few years or decades \nago. Today, I can affirm that it is a real possibility. \nWe have already begun discussions on the last two \nsubstantive points of the plan: the victims and the end \nof the conflict. This war has left in its wake millions of \nvictims who never had a voice before and who are now \nat the centre of the process. We are working to fulfil \nthe rights of victims to justice, truth, reparations and \nnon-recurrence. Above all, we are working to ensure \nthat there are no more victims.\n\nIn an act that I believe to be without precedent in \nthe history of the world, representatives of the victims \nare explaining their situations, exposing their pain and \nsetting out their expectations before the Government \nand guerrillas. The victims are the main protagonists \nand the main beneficiaries of the peace that we seek. \nConstanza Turbay, who represents the courage of our \nwomen and who lost most of her family at the hands \nof the guerrillas, had the opportunity to confront her \nvictimizers, look them in the eye and to directly hear \ntheir expressions of sincere remorse. In her own words, \nMs. Turbay stated that the victims are \u201creplacing \ntheir pain with the hope of peace\u201d. Another woman, \nMs. Juanita Barragan, who spent several years of her \nyouth within the ranks of the FARC, was able to tell her \nformer leaders in Havana: \u201cPlease do not enlist more \nchildren to fight your war\u201d. Today, Ms. Barragan wants \nto be a lawyer and to work for children. There are so \nmany cases and so many voices that are finally being \nheard.\n\nWe have also created a subcommittee that \nincludes active military and police personnel. This \nsubcommittee is beginning to consider the details of \na definitive bilateral ceasefire process, as well as the \ndemobilization and disarmament of guerrillas upon \nsignature of the final agreement. I can therefore now \nreport to the international community that Colombia has \nmade substantial progress in its effort to end the armed \n\n\nconflict that has affected us to such a great extent, and, \ninevitably, impacted the region and the world.\n\nWhen the post-conflict phase begins, we will face \nimmense challenges in reintegrating those who have \ndemobilized, ensuring a State presence in conflict-\naffected areas, and guaranteeing civic security. \nThe support and contributions of the international \ncommunity are key in that regard, and we call for \nthat support. I take this opportunity to express \nour gratitude to the many nations and multilateral \nagencies \u2014 especially the United Nations \u2014 for their \ncommitment to the peace process and their willingness \nto provide all manner of support, not only now but also \nin the future as we implement those agreements in the \npost-conflict stage.\n\nIn my inaugural speech upon taking office for a \nsecond term as President of Colombia on 7 August, \nI stated the following, and repeat it today before the \nworld\u2019s nations. While conflicts rage around the world, \nColombia aspires to bring the good news for humankind \nthat the final armed conflict in the western hemisphere \nis coming to an end. If we are successful, as we truly \nexpect to be, we will be ready to share our experience \nwith other countries. We are sure that our case can \nbecome a model and a beacon of hope for the world\u2019s \nother conflicts.\n\nIn Colombia, we seek peace because the suffering \nof our fellow citizens pains us. We do not want any \nmore victims, or women or children involved in war. \nWe therefore understand the pain of and express our \nsolidarity with the many nations that today are suffering \nfrom war and unutterable atrocities, due \u2014 it must be \nsaid \u2014 to the impotence of the international community \nWe are not oblivious to the suffering of those who \nlive in such countries such as Syria, Iraq, Libya and \nUkraine and in regions like the Sahel. We condemn \nthe ruthless terrorism of the Islamic State in Iraq and \nthe Sham. We are not indifferent to the suffering of the \nmany families in Palestine and Israel who are victims \nof armed confrontations, or to the loss of life due to \nepidemics, such as Ebola in Africa.\n\nAs we approach the Organization\u2019s seventieth \nanniversary, we find ourselves at a defining moment in \nthe consolidation of the international system embodied \nby the United Nations. Full respect for international \nlaw and the purposes and principles enshrined in the \nCharter is essential to attaining lasting solutions to \novercome conflict and achieve progress in fulfilling the \nlegitimate aspirations of the people. In confrontations, \nwe must restore the ethical principles that are \nfundamental to the human condition, and children, \nwomen and civilians must be spared such tragedies.\n\nColombia favours negotiated political solutions. \nToday, we must ask questions that are not only rhetorical \nbut also true. Why are there people who stand against \npeace? Why do some see war as the only way out? \nPerhaps they do so because without war they would lose \ntheir power, accustomed as they are to making a living \nand profiting from it, and unable as they are to imagine \nlife without it. We have to convince the promoters of \nwar that this is not the way, and convert them into \npromoters of peace. We are doing just that in Colombia, \nand we must do the same in every corner of the planet. \nThe United Nations was established precisely to prevent \nconflict and to seek peace.\n\nUndoubtedly, the drug trade and drug trafficking \nare fuelling the conflicts in Colombia and elsewhere in \nthe world. Colombia has promoted a serious, technical \nand objective discussion of the methods and results \nof the so-called war on drugs. This war has not been \nwon, but we have had some success at the hemispheric \nlevel. Last week, at the Special General Assembly of \nthe Organization of American States in Guatemala, we \nachieved hemispheric consensus on several positions \nand adopted a resolution that shows that we can move \nforward together on this issue. Those results will help \nus to be more prepared to be able to achieve progress \nat the United Nations special session on drugs that has \nbeen called for 2016.\n\nLast month, in the inaugural speech of my second \nmandate, I set out for Colombians the vision that will \nguide our actions. I want to make Colombia a country \nof peace, a country with equality, and the most educated \ncountry in Latin America by 2025. At the same time, \nthis vision also draws us towards the future sustainable \ndevelopment goals for the post-2015 period \u2014 ambitious \ngoals that address humankind\u2019s most pressing social, \neconomic and environmental problems.\n\nThe good economic climate that Colombia is \nexperiencing, progress in the social indicators, \nparticularly poverty reduction and job creation, and the \npeace process itself allow us to believe in the possibility \nof achieving this vision. It is this Colombia, the one \nthat is overcoming poverty, has regained control of its \nterritory, is growing at the world\u2019s highest levels and \n\n\nhas successful social equality policies in order to find \nmore fairness, which is also searching for peace.\n\nI envisage the same things for Latin America and \nthe Caribbean as I envisage for my country \u2014 that \nwe can be a region at peace, with greater equality and \nbetter education; a region that makes the transition \nfrom resource-based economies to knowledge-based \neconomies; a region in which entrepreneurship and \ninnovation are the engines of development; a region with \nsocially and environmentally responsible companies \nthat transform our future.\n\nAs I said in the Assembly in 2010 (see A/65/PV.15), \nthis should be the decade of Latin America and the \nCaribbean. And now, before the world\u2019s nations, \nI reiterate the call on my region, Latin America and \nthe Caribbean, to remain true to that intention. To the \ninternational community, I make an impassioned appeal \nfor us to put everything we can \u2014 everything \u2014 into \nensuring that the sense of humanity overcomes war. We \nare losing our way when we look at the tragedies that \nhumankind is suffering without being pained by them, \nwithout the world waking up and taking decisive action \nto address them. We cannot allow ourselves to lose the \ncapacity to be shocked by war. It is time to wake up. It \nis time to act.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me \nsay that it is my pleasure to join previous speakers in \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am \n\nconfident that your experience in international affairs \nwill contribute to the success of the current session. \nWe stand ready to offer our full support during your \npresidency. I would also like to take this opportunity \nto commend your predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for his \nwise leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. I also would like to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and United Nations staff around \nthe world for their continued efforts to promote global \npeace and security and to achieve development and \nwell-being for all people.\n\nWe meet today, as we do each year, to renew \nour commitment to the principles enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations, the basis on which \nthe Organization was founded, and to reiterate our \nfirm belief in its objectives, including creating a \npeaceful and secure world and achieving prosperity \nand development for all peoples. We believe that those \nnoble objectives can be achieved by doing two things. \nThe first is playing an effective and responsible role in \nregional and international issues through constructive \ndialogue, positive engagement and the peaceful \nresolution of disputes. The second is by creating a \nsuitable environment for international relations, based \non the principles of good-neighbourliness, moderation, \ntolerance and non-violence.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is gravely concerned about \ncurrent forms of extremism, terrorism and sectarian \ndivisions in our region, which have become a grave \nthreat to international peace and security. In addition to \nbeing a violation of human rights, terrorism threatens \nthe integrity and values of States, undermines their \nsocial fabric, disrupts their security and development, \nand erodes their cultural and human heritage. The acts of \nterrorist organizations \u2014 indiscriminate killings, mass \nexecutions, kidnappings and intimidation of innocent \nwomen and children \u2014 are heinous criminal acts and \nare strongly condemned by the United Arab Emirates. \nThe United Arab Emirates also denounces the brutal \nmethods used by such groups in the name of Islam, as \nIslam rejects such crimes, which are inconsistent with \nIslam\u2019s moderate approach and principles of peaceful \ncoexistence among all peoples.\n\nAs the international community must be aware, \nbesides the increased incidence of terrorist and \nextremist acts in our region, most notably those \nperpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \n(ISIS), the threats posed by those terrorist and extremist \ngroups are expanding beyond our region to threaten \nthe rest of the civilized world. Various countries in \nthe region, including Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, \nIraq, Syria, Libya and the States of the African Sahel, \nare suffering at the hands of terrorist takfiri groups, \nwhich have exploited unstable conditions in those \ncountries to create an environment that they believe \nwill guarantee them steady funding, logistical support, \ntraining and recruitment. Those extremist and terrorist \norganizations promote obscurantism, exclusivity and \nan illicit ideology, and they perpetrate brutal acts to \nimpose their control and increase their influence in \norder to achieve their goals. The current collective \naction against the threat of ISIS and other terrorist \ngroups reflects the international community\u2019s shared \nconviction of the need to confront the imminent danger. \nCivilized communities have no other option than to \nstamp out that threat. It is a test in which we must \nsucceed.\n\nWith regard to Libya, the United Arab Emirates is \nconcerned about the deteriorating security conditions \nand their repercussions on the stability of neighbouring \ncountries. We strongly oppose the terrorist acts that \nhave undermined the work of legitimately elected \ninstitutions in Libya. The United Arab Emirates\u2019s policy \ntowards Libya is to provide full and unconditional \nsupport for the legitimate decisions taken by the \nLibyan people through their nationally elected House \nof Representatives.\n\nThe latest developments in our brother country, \nIraq, are increasingly alarming. ISIS has exploited \nthe sectarian practices of the former Government in \nIraq to garner the support of affected communities \nin expanding their influence over large parts of the \ncountry with extreme brutality. While the terrorist \ngroups are threatening the sovereignty of Iraq and its \nsocial, cultural and religious fabric, they continue to \nexploit the chaos in Syria to achieve their purposes \nwithout any regard for sovereignty or national borders.\n\nIn that context, the United Arab Emirates believes \nthat the current collective action will address the \ngrowing threat of extremist fighters in Syria as well as \nin Iraq. In that regard, I welcome the recent decision \nof the Security Council to confront and block the \nextremist groups. The threat posed by extremist \nfighters has increased in the midst of the violence \ninflicted by the Syrian regime on the Syrian people. \nAt this critical juncture, we must support the moderate \nSyrian opposition as part of an effective strategy to \ncounter extremism and terrorism.\n\nFrom this platform, we express our deep concern \nat the grave developments taking place in Yemen. The \nHouthis, who are using violence to try to undermine \nthe political process and the constitutional legitimacy \nof the Yemeni State, compel us to take a firm and \nimmediate stand against attempts to change the reality \nthrough violence and force. We have to realize that an \nexclusively sectarian and individualistic approach is \nnot an acceptable option to the Yemeni people, who \naspire to build an inclusive civil State that is capable \nof committing to a national dialogue and continuing \nthe implementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council \ninitiative and its mechanisms. The United Arab Emirates \nwill continue to support the political transition process \nin Yemen and will assist the efforts of the Yemeni State \nto achieve stability and development.\n\nIn the light of the recent developments in the region, \nit is incumbent on us, as nations that have pledged \nto abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter, \nto focus our efforts on combating that dangerous \nscourge. The United Arab Emirates therefore calls \non the international community and Member States \nto cooperate in combating terrorist groups and to \ntake comprehensive measures to fight them through \na clear, unified strategy. Those efforts should not \nbe limited to Iraq and Syria alone, but must also be \ndirected against the locations of those groups wherever \nthey exist. We wish also to stress the futility of taking \ngradual measures to address those challenges. We must \nintensify our efforts in order to combat the terrorist \ngroups promptly and effectively.\n\nWhile our attention should be fully focused on \ncountering terrorism, the United Arab Emirates \nbelieves that providing support to Governments facing \nserious security challenges is of critical importance. \nActive participation is also required to provide the \nnecessary assistance to restore peace and security in \nthose countries by helping them to strengthen their \nlegitimate institutions. In that context, we continue to \nhighlight the importance of respecting the sovereignty \nand independence of States and supporting all political \nefforts aimed at achieving peaceful settlements of \nongoing conflicts and disputes. Without those efforts, \nviolence will continue. The United Arab Emirates hopes \nto see security and stability prevail in and throughout \nall countries.\n\nI once again reiterate the firm position of the \nUnited Arab Emirates in rejection of terrorism and \nextremism in all their forms. My country is fulfilling \nits responsibilities and is committed to participating \nconstructively at the national, regional and international \nlevels to combat violent extremism and affiliated \nbeliefs and terrorist acts. The United Arab Emirates, \nthrough its membership in the Global Counterterrorism \nForum, cooperates with international organizations and \nwith concerned countries to ensure that the territories \nof the latter are not exploited by those who facilitate or \nexecute terrorist acts, as well as other related crimes, \nsuch as the financing of terrorism, human trafficking \nand the recruitment of people to commit those egregious \ncrimes. By hosting the Hedayah Centre for training, \ndialogue and research to combat violent extremism, \nthe United Arab Emirates continues to support the \ninternational community in building capacities and \nexchanging best practices on that issue.\n\nMy country also continues to develop its national \npolicies and its legislative and executive systems in \norder to deter and confront all terrorist acts, eradicate \nthe roots of terrorism and protect our youth from being \nlured into a cycle of extremism and violence. To that end, \nthe United Arab Emirates recently adopted a federal law \non combating terrorist crimes. The law provides strict \npenalties for those found guilty of inciting terrorism or \ncommitting terrorist acts. The United Arab Emirates is \nalso strengthening preventive policies by establishing \ncentres for the rehabilitation of people influenced by \nextremist and terrorist ideologies.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hopes for the recovery \nand restoration of security and stability in the region \nso that Governments can carry out their duties and \nobligations and their peoples can resume their normal \nlives in a constructive way. That hope is driven by the \nremarkable progress achieved by the new Government \nin Egypt and its good governance in implementing its \npolitical road map. Despite the challenges facing Egypt, \nthe signs of normalcy in public life and the revived \neconomy and culture are promising. Therefore, the \nUnited Arab Emirates regrets the statements of some \nrepresentatives and their unacceptable questioning of \nthe legitimacy of the Egyptian Government.\n\nThe present Egyptian Government was freely \nelected by the Egyptian people, who believe in its ability \nto fulfil their aspirations. Questioning the Egyptian \npeople\u2019s will and right to choose their representatives \nis an interference in the internal affairs of Egypt and \nundermines its stability. Accordingly, I emphasize that \nthe stability of our region depends on the stability of \nEgypt.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates therefore calls on the \ninternational community to provide the necessary \nsupport to the Egyptian Government and its economy \nin order to boost Egypt\u2019s efforts to achieve progress and \nprosperity. I would also like to commend the generous \ninitiative of the King of Saudi Arabia, Custodian of the \nTwo Holy Mosques, in convening the economic summit \nto support the Egyptian economy. His is a visionary \napproach to promoting Egypt\u2019s future and maintaining \nmoderation in the region.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates expresses its \ndisappointment over the failure of the peace negotiations \nbetween Palestine and Israel. We strongly condemn \nIsrael\u2019s aggression against Gaza, especially the \ndestruction directed against the civilian population and \ninfrastructure, including some United Nations facilities. \nWe demand a thorough, transparent and independent \ninvestigation to determine legal responsibility for the \ndamage. We hope that the continued failure of the peace \nnegotiations will not lead to a resurgence of violence \nand the return to the region of a new and more brutal \nform of terrorism.\n\nThe establishment of peace and security in the \nregion is a key element in achieving global stability \nand a priority of our foreign policy, which derives \nits principles from the Charter of the United Nations \nand the provisions of international law. On the basis \nof those principles, my Government again rejects the \ncontinuing Iranian occupation of three islands that \nbelong to the United Arab Emirates \u2014 Greater Tunb, \nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa. We demand restoration \nof the full sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates \nover the islands and emphasize that all actions and \nmeasures taken by the Iranian authorities are contrary \nto international law and custom and to all our common \nhuman values. In that respect, we note that the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran has recently hoisted the Iranian \nflag on the part of Abu Musa island allocated to the \nUnited Arab Emirates under the 1971 memorandum of \nunderstanding, in violation of the memorandum. My \ncountry strongly condemns that action as a flagrant \nviolation of the memorandum of understanding and \nregards it as devoid of any legal effect.\n\nWe therefore renew our call to the international \ncommunity to prevail on Iran to respond to the repeated \npeaceful, sincere calls of the United Arab Emirates for \na just settlement of the issue, either through direct, \nformal negotiations between the two countries, or by \nreferral to the International Court of Justice to finally \nsettle the dispute in accordance with the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \nprovisions of international law.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the ongoing \nnegotiations between the five permanent members of the \nSecurity Council and the Islamic Republic of Iran aimed \nat reaching a comprehensive settlement concerning the \nIranian nuclear programme. We affirm that, in order \nto avert an arms race in the region, a final and strict \nagreement must be achieved; the region cannot afford \nfurther tension and instability. Nevertheless, the United \nArab Emirates believes that the peaceful use of nuclear \nenergy is a necessity in meeting the world\u2019s growing \nenergy demands. My country is proud to be a pioneer in \nthis field and to successfully harness the peaceful use \nof nuclear technology in compliance with the highest \nstandards of transparency, safety and security.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the region, my \ncountry has always sought to remain a model of \nmoderation, tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the \nregion, consistent with current international efforts. We \nstrongly believe that investment in human development \nis important in the long term, and we therefore attach \ngreat importance to the negotiations on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda and the sustainable development \ngoals. We welcome the results of those consultations, \nwhich have placed the eradication of poverty at the \nheart of the development agenda.\n\nMy country also supports the inclusion of goals \nthat would provide sustainable energy for all, develop \ngreen economies, promote food security, supply \nsafe drinking water and ensure gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment. The United Arab Emirates is \ncommitted to pursuing economic and social policies \naimed primarily at achieving the development of the \nindividual, providing all means necessary for a person \nto lead a decent and productive life, and promoting \nprosperity. In that context, I note that Dubai has been \nchosen as the venue of the 2020 World Expo. It is a \ngreat honour for us to act as host to this event, and we \nthank all the countries that supported our candidacy. \nWe look forward to working with Member States to \norganize an exhibition that meets the aspirations of all.\n\nComprehensive and sustainable development \ncannot be achieved unless all segments of society \nparticipate in the national development process. \nAccordingly, the United Arab Emirates pays special \nattention to women\u2019s empowerment. My country now \noccupies a prominent place among the countries of the \n\nworld in terms of women\u2019s achievements and success \nin all areas of life. Our efforts are not limited solely to \nempowering women in the United Arab Emirates, but \nalso include supporting women throughout the region \nand around the world.\n\nAbu Dhabi will host a UN-Women Liaison Office \nwith the support and leadership of Her Highness \nSheikha Fatima bint Mubarak. We are also assisting \nUN-Women in the preparations for the high-level \nreview on women, peace, and security. Those efforts \nreflect the interest and participation of the United Arab \nEmirates in international efforts to empower women \nas effective partners and agents in preventing war and \nresolving conflict, keeping in mind that women play a \nkey role in countering violence and promoting peace \nand security throughout the world.\n\nWe must continue to devote special attention \nto the issue of climate change. Recent international \nreports indicate that the effects of climate change have \nbecome a major challenge to development. But there \nis still some time left to mitigate the impact through \ninternational cooperation. In that context, we welcome \nthe outcome of the recent Climate Summit held a \nfew days ago at the United Nations. We are grateful \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to \nadvance that important issue prior to the start of the \ngeneral debate of the General Assembly, and we thank \nall the participating parties. We also urge all parties \nto abide by the agreements reached and stress that the \ndeveloped countries must take the lead in that respect.\n\nThe efforts of the United Arab Emirates in the field \nof renewable energy are seen in various parts of the \nworld. We host the International Renewable Energy \nAgency in Abu Dhabi and make available more than \n$500 million in the form of grants and low-interest loans \nfor renewable energy projects in developing countries. \nWe also have extensive and varied international \ncommercial investments totalling billions of dollars \nin the renewable-energy sector. Such initiatives, \ninvestments and grants all contribute to addressing \nclimate change and its impact throughout the world.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore that the \nUnited Arab Emirates will continue to make every \neffort to achieve our aspiration to contribute to a secure \nand stable world, in which people can live in dignity, \npeace and happiness.\n"

        "file_text": "The sixty-\nninth session offers us a theme that invites us to deepen \n\nexchanges on the development model that we want for \nthe world post-2015. The theme, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d, is perfectly in line with the theme of the sixty-\neighth session, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d.\n\nAt previous sessions, we have acknowledged that \ndevelopment through the achievement the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has not produced the \nexpected results for many States. Among the main \ncauses for this are the weakness of solidarity in financing \nthe Goals; their poor adaptation to the concerns and \nrealities of Africa; and the many global financial, \nfood, environmental and security crises that arose. The \nunanimously welcomed drafting of a post-2015 agenda \ngave us the opportunity to review the MDGs in greater \ndepth and to respond relevantly. Africa, for its part, has \nadopted a Common Position that requires the adherence \nof all States and their partners. This Common African \nPosition is part of the Africa Vision 2063. That is why \nmy country, Chad, fully supports it and hopes that \nthis approach will figure prominently in the post-2015 \nagenda.\n\nUnfortunately, we note that on the eve of the \nimportant post-2015 meeting, the same security risks \nremain. Armed conflicts and the phenomenon of \nterrorism are becoming persistant threats in several \nareas of Africa. They are aggravated by the migratory \nphenomenon that deprives our continent, Africa, of its \nworkforce. We must therefore join our efforts to bring \nadequate and energetic responses to these phenomena, \nwhich dangerously compromise the future of our \ncontinent.\n\nI take this occasion to hail the upsurge of \nsolidarity that we are witnessing on the part of the \ninternational community in combating terrorism \nand underdevelopment. Africa remains in favour of \nvarious strategies for security and development in the \nSahel initiated by the United Nations, the European \nUnion and many other organizations. We hope that the \nimplementation of these programmes will be effective \nso as to allow our continent to effectively combat these \nongoing phenomena.\n\nBeyond international support, these security \nchallenges require African countries to take their \nsecurity into their own hands by implementing laws \nthat will ensure security at the national, regional and \ncontinental levels. The countries of the Sahel \u2014 Burkina \nFaso, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Chad \u2014 have \nmobilized through the Group of Five countries of the \nSahel to combine their efforts in building a strong \nsystem of resilience, good governance, security and \npeace. It is well known that the security of one country \nor region is directly linked to its development, that of its \nneighbours, and thereby to that of the entire continent.\n\nThe terrorism summit convened by the African \nUnion Peace and Security Council, over which we \npresided on 2 September in Nairobi, was a part of \nthese constant efforts. It sought to consider in depth \nthe terrorist threat and to agree specific and concrete \nmeasures to consolidate the efficacy of collective \nactions against this scourge. The summit also gave us \nthe opportunity to highlight our solidarity with Kenya \nin particular, and more generally with the East African \nregion, which is facing the threat of the terrorist \nAl-Shabaab group.\n\nThe decision to create such mechanisms as the \nAfrican Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises \nor the African regional force for the Sahel-Sahara \nand Central Africa, was the fruit of this regional \nand continental resolve to respond appropriately to \nterrorism, which is progressively gaining ground in \nAfrica. We call on the countries of the Lake Chad Basin \nCommission to take the necessary measures to bring \nthe joint multinational force into operation in order to \ncombat the terrorist activities of Boko Haram.\n\nWith respect to conflict resolution, Chad continues \nto contribute to peace and reconciliation in Africa. \nThis goodwill is borne out by the organization on its \nterritory, at Amdjarass in the north, of a forum of peace \nand reconciliation between the warring brothers of \nDarfur. Chad welcomes the holding of the Brazzaville \nforum on reconciliation and inclusive dialogue between \nCentral African brothers, where it played an active part \nin seeking solutions to Central African crises.\n\nMy country welcomes the inter-Malian dialogue \ntowards a definitive return to peace and security in that \ncountry. It welcomes the reconciliation process under \nway in South Sudan to persuade the South Sudanese \nto take up the peace pipe. We are convinced that \nsincere dialogue and surpassing ourselves are virtues \nthat can assist in resolving these issues. My country \nwill continue to support this process of dialogue and \nreconciliation.\n\nRegarding the new Libya \u2014 a country that has barely \nbegun to exist as a homogenous entity after the fall of \nthe Al-Qadhafi\u2019s regime and his assassination \u2014 the \n\n\nviolence has intensified and the people live in constant \nfear. Libya\u2019s neighbours are striving to assist that \nbrotherly country to recover its stability. The entire \ninternational community is called upon to act on \nthe severe security situation in that country. Libyan \nbrothers of different political and social beliefs must \nunderstand that peace can come only from the Libyans \nthemselves. They must therefore resolutely commit to \na political settlement, the only proper path to ensure \npeace, unity and territorial integrity for Libya.\n\nChad, a neighbouring country of Libya, the Central \nAfrican Republic, the Sudan and Nigeria, is hosting \nhundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced \npersons who have fled armed conflicts or terrorist \nthreats. Since 2003, we have welcomed more than \n500,000 refugees from these neighbouring countries \nand more than 200,000 Chadians repatriated from \nLibya and the Central African Republic for security \nreasons, including displaced Chadians. A national plan \nfor global response developed by the Government and \nits technical and financial partners has been adopted \nand is being implemented, but it requires the financial \nand material support of the international community.\n\nThese various conflict situations are compounded \nby other, no less important challenges such as poverty, \nunderdevelopment and illnesses. I note in particular the \nsevere Ebola crisis affecting certain countries on the \nAfrican continent, ravaging populations and gravely \naffecting the economies concerned. Chad will make \nits financial contributions to these countries. The \ninternational community must act, and act quickly, \nin a coordinated manner as the Ebola virus knows no \nborders. I commend the upsurge of solidarity on the \npart of the international community in containing the \nspread of this scourge.\n\nBeyond Africa, we call for a peaceful resolution \nto the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and between \nIsrael and Palestine, to name but a few. On Palestine \nspecifically, we feel that the disproportionate use of \nforce and the human and material damage incurred \nin Gaza are unacceptable and challenge the human \nconscience. It is extremely urgent to find a solution \nto this conflict, which has lasted for far too long. We \ntherefore call on all parties for restraint and dialogue in \norder to reach a just, global and lasting solution.\n\nRegarding the embargo to which Cuba has been \nsubject for many years, we once again reiterate our call \nfor it to be lifted, pure and simple.\n\nPeace, stability and development are intrinsically \nlinked to respect for laws and universal shared values, \nof which justice is the basis. Nevertheless, we note \nwith regret that these universal principles are not often \nrespected, especially by the powerful of this world. This \nis the case for the International Criminal Court, which, \ninstead of being neutral, impartial and independent, \nseems more to practise double standards and only \npursues the weak. Some 90 per cent of indictees are \nAfricans.\n\nThe debate on the reform of the Security Council \nmust be concluded, taking into account the interests and \nconcerns of all States so that it reflects the actual makeup \nof the world. It is unjust that a billion inhabitants live in \nthe only continent without a permanent representative \nin that organ.\n\nAt the national level Chad has a national development \nplan for 2013-2015 and a national programme for food \nsecurity which seek to ensure resilient and emerging \ndevelopment by 2025, supported by sustainable and \ndiversified sources of growth that create added value \nand employment. The plan ensures that each Chadian \nhas appropriate access to basic social services, decent \nhousing and to adequate training opportunities. I \nagain thank all our partners who announced their \nparticipation in financing these two programmes at the \nParis conference in June.\n\nIn order to promote a serene climate in national \npolitical life Chad has implemented mechanisms for \npolitical governance, the latest of which is the national \nframework for political dialogue created in April 2013. \nThis mechanism is better adapted to current political \nevents as it includes civil society along with political \nparties. These mechanisms have led to stability \nconducive to economic and social development in a \ncountry where challenges remain considerable.\n\nTo improve governance, Chad has adhered to the \nmonitoring mechanism of the African Union and the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That \nadherence clearly demonstrates our resolve to manage \nour national resources in complete transparency. Chad \nwill continue to work to consolidate the rule of law and \ngood governance through substantial reforms of its \ninstitutions, to combat unemployment by creating jobs \nfor youth, and to combat poverty and food insecurity.\n\n"

        "file_text": "As we enter a crucial session \nof the General Assembly, we will define our post-2015 \ndirection. Our way ahead must be based on the triangle \nof security, development and human rights. If one of \nthose elements is not present, the other two will fail.\n\nThis year, we commemorated the grim anniversaries \nof the First and Second World Wars. Both wars began \nin Europe, but quickly spread throughout the world, \ndestroying the lives of countless millions. The League \nof Nations and the United Nations were built on the \nashes of those wars.\n\nToday again, global security and peace are \nchallenged by forces willing to rewrite the history \nand rules of the international order. The aggression of \nRussia against Ukraine has defied the basic principles \nof the United Nations, uprooting the very foundation \nof the international system. It has grabbed part of a \nsovereign European country, using previously unseen \ntactics of warfare and immense propaganda against \nits neighbour. It enabled the tragic shooting down of \na civilian airplane. It has shown that agreements and \ncommitments do not matter, and it wantonly ignores \nand manipulates international opinion. Those actions \ncannot be qualified otherwise than as a threat to global \npeace and security. The world, including the General \nAssembly, has supported Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. \nThe illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol by \nRussia has been condemned and will not be recognized \nby the international community.\n\nRussia has a vital role to play in security and stability \nin Europe and should be part of the solution \u2014 not part \nof the problem. Latvia hopes that the ceasefire agreed \nto on 5 September will be implemented in a sustainable \nmanner. Latvia therefore calls on Russia to immediately \nwithdraw its armed forces from Ukrainian territory and \nstop sending weapons and mercenaries to the terrorist \ngroups. We call upon Russia to return to respecting its \ninternational commitments and upholding international \nlaw.\n\nSeventy-five years ago, the decay of the \ninternational system proved fatal to the Baltic States. \nTwo totalitarian regimes \u2014 one under Hitler and the \nother under Stalin \u2014 divided Europe, and we lost our \nfreedom for 50 long years. Twenty-five years ago, more \nthan 2 million people joined hands and formed a human \nchain across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic \nway clearly illustrated the people\u2019s demand for freedom \nand restoration of their statehood. The Baltic people \nmade their choice. The Ukrainian people have the same \nright to choose their own democratic path, human rights \nand fundamental freedoms.\n\nLatvia supports the complementarity of efforts \namong international organizations at both the global and \nregional levels to use all instruments at their disposal to \nprevent the emergence of a frozen conflict in the eastern \nregion of Ukraine; to help and support Ukraine; to \nuphold agreements and commitments and demand their \nfulfilment by all parties, including Russia; to maintain \nunity and reject attempts to divide Ukraine by reviving \nspheres of influence and establishing hidden support to \nterrorists as part of the new norms of Europe.\n\nThere is no alternative to an international order \nbased on the rule of law, democracy and respect \nfor human rights and providing the foundation for \nlong-term peace and security. The resolution of the \nprotracted conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South \nOssetia and Nagorno Karabakh should remain high on \nthe international agenda.\n\n\nIn addition, the security situation in the wider \nMiddle East is very fragile. A solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict is paramount in order to establish \nlasting stability in the region. Following the escalation of \nviolence in recent months, the international community, \nincluding Latvia, has helped to address the emergency \nhumanitarian needs of the people of Gaza. We hope \nthat the current ceasefire will be fully respected by \nboth sides. However, only an agreement on a two-State \nsolution, achieved through direct negotiations, will \naccomplish those goals.\n\nWe welcome the elimination of Syria\u2019s chemical \nweapons and related materials. While easing the \ncontinuing human suffering of Syrians is the immediate \ngoal, the international community must continue \npolitical efforts to find a solution to that horrific \nconflict. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes \nagainst humanity in Syria must be held accountable by \nthe International Criminal Court.\n\nThe limited ability of the Security Council to \naddress the urgent situations in Syria and Ukraine in \na timely manner underlines the need to move forward \nwith reform of the Council. Latvia supports the \nexpansion of the Security Council in both categories \nof membership. At the same time, the French initiative, \naimed at restricting the use of the veto, merits our joint \nattention.\n\nThe completion of the International Security \nAssistance Force mission in Afghanistan this year \nwill be an important step towards assumption by the \npeople of full responsibility for peace and stability \nin the country. Despite all the challenges, the legacy \nof the mission is clear. Peace and security have been \nstrengthened, including greater respect for human \nrights and greater opportunities for the Afghan people \nthan ever before.\n\nThe recent presidential elections clearly showed \nthe will of the Afghan people to live in a peaceful and \ndemocratic society. The people of Afghanistan will \nnot be abandoned after 2014. International support \nto Afghanistan, including security protection, will \nbe continued. I am convinced that cooperation and \nconfidence-building between Afghanistan and its \nneighbours, including in Central Asia, will be key to \nlong-term security solutions in the region.\n\nThe growing negative impact of violent extremist \nideologies in Syria, Iraq and other countries is \nalarming. Militant fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq \nand the Sham (ISIS) have exploited instability in those \ncountries and now pose a threat to ethnic and religious \ncommunities. In that context, Latvia joined the United \nStates in coordinated efforts by the international \ncommunity to counter ISIS. We strongly welcome the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on \nforeign fighters. Latvia has already begun to prepare \nmeasures to prevent the recruitment of and support to \nforeign fighters.\n\nLatvia is concerned about the safety of journalists \nduring political unrest and conflict. All imprisoned \njournalists must be released. Freedom of the media \nand free access to information, including online, are \nessential components of any democracy.\n\nArmed conflicts in Africa have an impact upon \nstability and the sustainable development of the people. \nLatvia takes part in peace and security operations \nin Mali and the Central African Republic in order to \ncontribute to conflict settlement and to improve the \nsecurity situation in those regions. Latvia is ready to \ncommit itself to strengthening United Nations global \npeacekeeping.\n\nLatvia welcomes the ongoing dialogue between \nthe E3+3 countries and Iran, which aims to negotiate a \ncomprehensive agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. \nThe parties involved, in particular Iran, must make \nevery effort to use the extended time frame to find a \nsolution. We must work towards revitalizing the global \ndisarmament and non-proliferation agenda. The success \nof the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \ndepends on re-establishing trust and a common purpose \namong the States parties. Latvia was one of the first \nStates to sign and to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty. We \nurge all United Nations Members to do the same.\n\nPeace and security are both enablers of sustainable \ndevelopment and objectives in their own right. Without \npeaceful societies, we cannot achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. Each country has its own responsibility \nfor achieving that goal. Our societies need honest \nand accountable Governments that protect them from \nviolence and crime and ensure fundamental freedoms \nand sustainable economic growth.\n\nFourteen years ago, we, the States Members of \nthe United Nations, made a historic commitment to \neradicating extreme poverty and to improving the health \nand welfare of the world\u2019s people within 15 years. The \nnew development agenda should go further. We must \n\n\naddress global challenges, such as conflicts, terrorism, \ninequalities, the absence of the rule of law, climate \nchange and natural disasters. The social, economic and \nenvironmental dimensions of sustainability should be \naddressed in a balanced way.\n\n\nI thank the Secretary-General for his personal \nengagement in bringing together representatives of \nGovernments, business, industry, finance and civil \nsociety to discuss climate change this week. Latvia \nsupports the initiatives of the Secretary-General. The \npost-2015 agenda must be consistent with all human \nrights and be underpinned by the rule of law. It should \naddress inequalities and discrimination, including \nby means of the advancement of information and \ncommunications technology. Those are key enablers \nfor all spheres of development. Gender equality is \nessential to shaping respectful and equal relationships \nin society. Those values are important for Latvia. As \nan aspiring member of the Human Rights Council for \nthe term 2015-2017, we will continue to promote such \nvalues globally. Last but not least, the post-2015 agenda \nshould be built on strong accountability mechanisms \nand a strengthened global partnership. That requires \nthe active engagement of Governments, civil society, \nthe private sector and the United Nation system.\n\nIn the first half of 2015, Latvia will assume the \npresidency of the Council of the European Union. \nEurope needs the world as much as the world needs \nEurope. That is why the Latvian presidency will focus \non strengthening the European Union\u2019s involvement \nglobally. We will actively work to promote Europe\u2019s \ncooperation with its neighbours and with the countries \nof Central Asia. I affirm my country\u2019s commitment \nto actively engaging in efforts to shape our common \nfuture.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring everyone warm greetings \nfrom the people of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am once \nagain privileged to address this body. In my country we \nbegin all formal addresses by conferring blessings of \npeace and good health on all present, so let me say Kam \nna bane ni Mauri.\n\nI echo the sentiments conveyed by previous \nspeakers in congratulating the President on assuming \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. I am confident that under his able \nstewardship, our Organization will continue its work \ntowards improving the security and quality of life for \nall members of our global community, in particular \nthe most vulnerable. Let me also take this opportunity \nto acknowledge with appreciation the commendable \nleadership of his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for his \nguidance and stewardship over the past year.\n\nI also wish to commend the unwavering commitment \nand hard work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, who has served as an able navigator of our \nfamily\u2019s ship, steering the United Nations through \nthe diverse and complex realities and the myriad of \nchallenges facing our peoples and nations around the \nworld. In particular, I wish to commend his sterling \nleadership and demonstrated personal commitment to \nthe need to focus global attention on those who are most \nvulnerable and who are on the front line of the many \nmajor challenges facing us today as a global community.\n\nWe meet at a very critical time in the history of \nmultilateralism. The global community is in the process \nof shaping a post-2015 development framework. We \nare hearing stronger calls for United Nations reforms, \nfor reassessing the way we do things in our family of \nnations. The membership is calling for a move away \nfrom business as usual and for transformational \nchanges. We welcome the theme of the sixty-ninth \nsession \u2014 \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d \u2014 as it \naptly captures the call for changes by the membership.\n\nEarlier this week, on Tuesday, we concluded one of \nthe most successful conferences ever convened by the \nSecretary-General on climate change. We applaud the \nleadership and the Secretary-General\u2019s very positive \ninitiative. Those of us on the front line of the impacts \nof climate change welcome the renewed focus and the \nrallying by the United Nations membership behind the \nSecretary-General\u2019s call for ambitious announcements \nand commitments. The real challenge, however, is \nin being able to translate those commitments and \nannouncements into action.\n\nThree weeks ago, Samoa hosted the Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates. The United Nations and those who attended \ndeclared it a resounding success. We thank our gracious \nhosts \u2014 the Government and the people of Samoa. \nThose very successful conferences signify recognition \nby the United Nations and the membership of the need \nto highlight the special case of those on the front line \nof sustainable development, to refocus global attention \nto the prevailing socioeconomic and environmental \nchallenges that continue to constrain efforts by small \nisland developing States (SIDS) to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. That is particularly pertinent now, as the \ninternational community is in the process of shaping \nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nThe Small Island Developing States Accelerated \nModalities of Action provides a clear blueprint of \nhow the SIDS want to move forward in their efforts \nto achieve sustainable development. The real test of \nthe success of the Samoa Conference, however, is in \nthe adoption of outcomes into genuine and durable \npartnerships that can translate into activities on the \nground that will deliver tangible benefits to our people.\n\nWhile SIDS heard the plight of some of the most \nvulnerable, other United Nations processes are talking \nabout the graduation of those countries from the least \ndeveloped countries category. We believe that there is \na contradiction here. If we as a family of nations do \nnot act and do not work in partnership with those on \nthe front line of major challenges, whatever they may \nbe, then we will have failed in our efforts. I would like \nto reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his demonstrated commitment and \nleadership in focusing the United Nations and global \nattention on the plight of the most needy, in alleviating \npoverty, addressing the Ebola epidemic, raising the \nvoices of youth and women and their participation in \ndevelopment, ending gender-based violence, promoting \npeace and security, and acting against climate change \nnow.\n\nAs I have highlighted on numerous occasions \nin the past, including earlier this week, the issue \nof climate change remains the most single pressing \nchallenge for us in Kiribati. Climate change is an \nexistential challenge for low-lying island countries like \nmine, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives and \n\nTokelau, and I again call for urgent global action to \nhelp those countries adapt and for international legally \nbinding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions. \nThe global community cannot afford to not listen to our \nstories and to the plight of our peoples. Our plight is the \nplight of the global community, further down the line. \nEveryone\u2019s future is on the line.\n\nI have just returned from an Arctic expedition, to \nthe North Pole \u2014 hence, my loss of voice. I am still \noverwhelmed today by what I witnessed with my own \neyes. The melting of the massive sheets of ice in the \nArctic region due to climate change will not only have \nsevere impacts on the lives of people in that region but \nwill also result in the demise of future generations in \nother parts of the globe, in particular our most vulnerable \natoll island nations. It has been an eye-opener for me \nto spend time in the past week in polar conditions. It \ngave me a wider perspective of the immensity of what \nis at stake beyond our own immediate concerns. That \nvisit to the Arctic region highlighted the stark reality \nof the very direct connection between the destruction \nof that polar region to what is happening to us in the \nequatorial region, and the very unlikely possibility of \never reversing that process once it has gone so far.\n\nOn Tuesday we heard the voice of a very talented \nyoung woman, Ms. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a poet from \nour part of the world, from the Marshall Islands. Her \nvoice represents the apprehension, the concern and the \nvoice of mothers from low-lying countries like ours \nwho lament what the future holds for their children \nand their children\u2019s children. Surely, we as leaders and \nthe mothers like Kathy and millions of others around \nthe world share, or should share, the same ultimate \ngoal \u2014 to leave to our children and grandchildren a \nfuture that is better than what we inherited from our \nforefathers. We from Kiribati salute Kathy for reaching \nout and for touching the hearts of leaders who heard \nher speak. May she touch many hearts and move many \nmore hearts.\n\nThe very sad reality is that we are just not on \ncourse to achieve that. It is glaringly obvious that \nwe need to do things differently. We owe it to those \nwhom we represent \u2014 our people. For us, climate \nchange is not an event in the future. It is an event that \nwe are dealing with today. We simply cannot talk of \nsustainable development without talking about climate \nchange. Earlier this week, I appealed to fellow leaders, \nand will do so again today, for all of us to work together \nagainst climate change and to move towards binding \ninternational agreements, towards a clean energy \nfuture, a healthier greener future for our children and a \nhealthier, greener home for our one planet, Earth.\n\nWhat are we doing? Let us accept full responsibility \nfor our own development to improve the well-being of \nour people into the future. We are determined to achieve \nthat by finding national solutions to overcome the \nenormous development challenges that constrain our \nefforts. My Government has mainstreamed sustainable \ndevelopment principles into our national development \nplan, policies and strategies. Climate change and \nadaptation measures are integrated into our national \nbudgeting process and development programmes to \nstrengthen disaster risk management. We have adopted \nan inclusive, whole-of-government and whole-of-nation \napproach aimed at addressing climate change impacts \nand strengthening our resilience.\n\nOur strategy for migration with dignity is an \ninvestment in the education of our people and upping \nthe skills of our young population to equip them with \nthe educational qualifications and employable skills \nthat will enable them to migrate with dignity to other \ncountries as a matter of choice and, in the worst-case \nscenario, when our islands can no longer sustain human \nlife.\n\nLast July, along with other frontline low-lying atoll \nisland States \u2014 Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Maldives \nand Tokelau \u2014 Kiribati initiated the establishment of \nthe Coalition of Low-lying Atoll Nations on Climate \nChange (CANCC). The Coalition held its inaugural \nmeeting in Tarawa in July and produced an outcome \ndocument that embraces the Coalition\u2019s goals and \nvision for building the resilience of our people in the \nface of the challenges of climate change. The initiative \nis prompted by the concerns we share regarding the \nincreasing severity of those challenges and the slow \npace of global action to address them. Our Coalition of \nnations continues to support the ongoing negotiations \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, but we also emphasize that urgent \naction must be taken now to assist our countries and \nall vulnerable communities to adapt to the impacts of \nclimate change.\n\nThe Coalition initiative demonstrates our political \ncommitment and determination to find innovative \nsolutions to the threats we face from climate change. \nWe are looking at building up our low islands and \nclimate-proofing our infrastructure, and at our \n\ndevelopment efforts to prepare and build the resilience \nof our people in the face of the challenge.\n\nWe cannot do this alone, and we acknowledge the \nsupport of our development partners and regional and \ninternational organizations that have assisted us and \ncontinue to support our efforts to address the challenge \nof climate change. However, much more remains to be \ndone, including making climate-financing facilities \nmore accessible and flexible, as the solutions and \noptions for facing this challenge vary from nation to \nnation.\n\nThe ocean plays a pivotal role in the sustainable \ndevelopment of my country. Our vision for achieving \nsustainable development hinges on the blue \neconomy \u2014 on the conservation and sustainable \nmanagement of our marine and ocean resources. \nWhile we in Kiribati have been labelled a small \nisland developing State, we are in fact a \u201clarge ocean\u201d \nState that spans an ocean area of 3.5 million square \nkilometres. The ocean has been an integral part of \nour life since time immemorial. While it now poses a \nserious threat to our survival from sea-level rise, it also \nprovides immense opportunities, not only as a source \nof daily sustenance, but also as a means through which \nwe can realize sustainable development and achieve \nlivelihoods for our people.\n\nOur exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is one of the \nlargest in the world and is home to abundant tuna \nresources that provide rich fishing grounds for our \ndistant fishing partners. We estimate that the total \nannual landed value of the fisheries industry in our \nEEZ is approximately $4 billion. Yet only 5 to 8 per \ncent of that comes to us as resource owners, through \nlicensing fees. We have to ask, where is the equity and \nfairness in that?\n\nThere is a need to review and restructure the \nnature of public and private partnerships in the fishing \nindustry. A more equitable partnership based on mutual \nrespect, goodwill, fairness and accountability will go \na long way in providing an enabling environment for \nsustainable development.\n\nMy Government is working to maximize the returns \nfrom our large fisheries resource through value-adding \nfisheries development, including on-shore processing. \nOur limited capacity in terms of capital, technical \nknow-how, a lack of infrastructure, distance from \ncommercial and trade centres and air and sea transport \nchallenges stands in the way of our progress towards \nthat development aspiration. Direct foreign investment \nand genuine partnership are therefore a way forward \nin that regard. I am confident that such partnership, \nforged around an equitable distribution of gains, will \nbe the development model going forward, with mutual \ngains to be made.\n\nHuman activities have been responsible for the \naccelerated degradation of our global environment, in \nthe pursuit of short-term economic gains without due \nregard to the health of our oceans and our environment. \nNever in human history has the health of our oceans \nand planet Earth been so challenged. We all have a \nshared responsibility and obligation with regard to the \nprotection of the ocean from further degradation and \nthe sustainable management of its rich biodiversity.\n\nMy country recognizes that shared responsibility \nand, in 2008, established the Phoenix Islands Protected \nArea (PIPA) in partnership with Conservation \nInternational and the New England Aquarium. \nUNESCO has inscribed PIPA on its list of World \nHeritage Sites. In January 2015, we will completely \nclose off the Phoenix Islands Protected Area to all \ncommercial fishing activity across an area of more than \n410,000 square kilometres, representing 11 per cent of \nour total EEZ \u2014 about the size of the state of California.\n\nPIPA is a rich fishing ground, so its total closure \non 31 December this year will entail loss of much-\nneeded revenue for Kiribati from fishing licence fees. \nFor us, it is a major but necessary short-term sacrifice \nfor the long-term health of our ocean and for sustaining \nfish stocks for global food security. It demonstrates \nour political commitment to the importance of marine \nconservation and the sustainable management of marine \nresources. It is our contribution to humankind and the \ncommon good of all.\n\nBut the announcement of complete closure of this \nvast marine protected area will amount to nothing \nwithout monitoring and enforcement. We have therefore \nestablished a PIPA trust fund to support our national \nefforts in managing PIPA and monitoring that vast \nmarine protected area. We thank those who share our \nvision and have contributed to the fund. We encourage \nour partners who have not yet done so to join with us in \nthat massive undertaking.\n\nThe challenges we face in the twenty-first century \nhave taken on a new dimension. It is no longer a fight \nto save a species here and a collapsed stock there; \nthe fight has become larger. It is now about how to \n\nensure the survival of whole peoples \u2014 communities, \nvillages, cities and nations. Entire ecosystems hang in \nthe balance, the ecosystems that provide us with the air \nwe breathe, the water we drink and much of the food we \neat. It is time to view our global development in a whole \nnew way. It is time to change business as usual. Indeed, \na paradigm shift and transformational development \napproaches are necessary, starting from within our own \nnations and moving out to regional and international \nmultilateral processes, institutions and partnerships.\n\nIt is high time we recognize that the new challenges \nrequire that we draw on all the resources available to the \nglobal community. Development and global challenges \ndo not belong to Governments alone. Let us bring in our \nyouth, our women, civil society, the private sector and \nour traditional institutions. Let us be inclusive. Let all \nthose who have a contribution to make make it.\n\nWe welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the \ninternational processes of the World Health Assembly. \nWe hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail \nin respect of our other international institutions and the \nUnited Nations processes, where Taiwan and all those \nthat can participate and contribute meaningfully for the \ngood of humankind can be brought in to do so.\n\nWe join in the broad international condemnation \nof criminal extremism and express the hope that such \ndestabilizing tensions in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region \nand elsewhere can be settled through peaceful means. \nAs distant as we think we are from the epicentres of \nsuch events, they nonetheless impact on us in a very \nreal way in our part of the world.\n\nIn my country, even before the advent of climate \nchange, the atoll environment was indeed harsh. Life \non the low-lying atoll islands has always been difficult. \nWe have always worked on the principle of working \ntogether as part of a community on the premise that \nthere will be some challenges that are larger than us and \nneed collaboration. The age-old test of our resilience \nand our strength as a community is defined by the well-\nbeing of the weakest member of our community. For us, \nsustainable development must be inclusive. It requires \nsincerity, goodwill, respect and the willingness to move \na little more slowly so as to assist and bring everyone \non board in order to move forward together.\n\nI would like to bring those principles to the United \nNations. The pursuit of sustainable development \nand lasting peace and security calls for and requires \nsacrifice. It requires inclusiveness. It requires \ncollective and decisive action. It also requires political \ncommitment and political leadership from all of us \nhere, for the time to act is now.\n\nOn that note, I leave members with the traditional \nblessing: may health, peace and prosperity be with us \nall.\n"

I would also like to congratulate \nAmbassador John William Ashe for the competent \nmanner in which he led the work of the previous \nsession. We extend our greetings to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon and commend him for his commitment to \nfinding solutions to the issues facing the international \ncommunity.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace in an environment that gives rise to concern \ndue to the aggravation of international tensions, the \nintensification of conflicts and the deepening of global \ncrises that require effective and sustainable solutions. \nIt is a matter of consensus that the solutions to common \nchallenges are to be found in multilateral negotiations \nand should take into account the specificities of each \n\n\ncountry and each people. The United Nations has \nalways been and will continue to be the mainstay of \nMember States\u2019 participation in decision-making on \nissues of concern to the international community and \nin upholding the global values of tolerance and peaceful \nand harmonious coexistence of countries and peoples, \nin accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter \nof the United Nations and international law.\n\nAngola would once again like to reiterate the \nimportance of all Member States joining in efforts \nto make the United Nations a strong and effective \norganization, and one that serves as the basis for a more \nbalanced, fair and inclusive international legal order \nand global security system, while promoting confidence \namong States and strengthening relations of friendship \nand international cooperation. Our Organization should \npay special attention to the resurgence of armed conflicts \nand their negative effects on populations, as well as to \narms flows, trafficking in drugs and human beings, \ntransnational organized crime, international terrorism \nand piracy \u2014 all phenomena that have an adverse \nimpact on economic development and consequently \nimpede the improvement of living conditions.\n\nReligious fundamentalism in some African \ncountries is taking on such violent proportions that \nit poses a threat to regional security, with serious \nconsequences for peace, stability and development. \nAngola strongly condemns the acts committed by \nterrorist groups and expresses its support for efforts to \nensure the full neutralization of those groups. Angola \nsupports efforts to strengthen the crisis-management \ncapacity of the United Nations and considers dialogue \nand negotiation to be the best means of resolving \nconflicts.\n\nWe will continue to meet our international \nobligations, with special emphasis on the African \ncontinent and the regional groupings in which we \noperate, including the Southern African Development \nCommunity, the Economic Community of Central \nAfrican States, the African countries that use Portuguese \nas an official language, the Gulf of Guinea Commission \nand the International Conference on the Great Lakes \nRegion, with a view to defining mechanisms and forms \nof cooperation with the United Nations, the African \nUnion, the Community of Portuguese-speaking \nCountries and other international partners.\n\nAngola assumed the rotating presidency of the \nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \nin January, and in that forum continues to promote the \nresolution of conflicts on the African continent with a \nview to attaining stability, political and institutional \ndevelopment, internal and border security, good \ngovernance and human rights. It is in that context \nthat Angola is engaged in the peace processes in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \nRepublic and the Great Lakes region.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic is an issue of great concern. \nThe position of the Security Council, which declared \nthe epidemic to be a threat to international peace and \nsecurity, fully reflects the seriousness of the situation. \nA decisive commitment on the part of the international \ncommunity is required if the scourge is to be combated \nand eradicated.\n\nWe reiterate the need to reform and revitalize the \nUnited Nations system, in particular the need to reform \nthe Security Council, which should be brought into \nline with the current international context and whose \nmembership should reflect an equitable geographical \nrepresentation through an increase in the number of \npermanent members. Angola reiterates the right of the \nAfrican continent to sit among the permanent members \nof the Council.\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the lack of \nprogress in finding a lasting solution are a major cause \nof widespread instability in the Middle East, and \nalso the root cause of the resurgence of terrorism in \nthe region. That situation worries the Government of \nAngola. We call for political will and flexibility from \nboth parties, and we encourage the Secretary-General \nand the United States Secretary of State to continue \ntheir mediation efforts with a view to establishing a \nsovereign and independent Palestinian State, as well as \na modus vivendi to ensure that the two States coexist \nin peace and security within internationally recognized \nborders.\n\nThe impasse in resolving the question of Western \nSahara continues to delay the exercise of the right \nto self-determination of the people of that territory. \nAngola calls on the parties to continue negotiations \nunder the auspices of the United Nations and the \nAfrican Union in order to find a solution in accordance \nwith the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \nand resolution 1514 (XV) of December 1960.\n\nWith regard to the situation in the Ukraine, Angola \ndeplores the loss of human lives caused by instability \n\n\nin the region and calls for dialogue between the parties \ninvolved to find a political solution to the conflict.\n\nThe situations in Somalia and South Sudan \nremain cause for concern. However, there has been \nsome encouraging progress, which is why we urge \nthe authorities in those countries and the international \ncommunity to continue their efforts for stabilization. \nAngola welcomes the constitutional normalization in \nsome African countries. We welcome the holding of \ndemocratic elections in Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar \nand Egypt, and we express our solidarity with the \nnational reconciliation and reconstruction processes \nand the economic and social development in those \ncountries.\n\nThe Government of Angola expresses its \nappreciation for the choice of the central theme of \nthis session, \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d. It is \ngreatly relevance, especially for the least developed \ncountries. The progress made in some of those \ncountries is far behind the targets of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, due to structural issues, and is \ninsufficient to mitigate the persistent effects of the \neconomic problems.\n\nWith one year remaining until the final assessment \nof the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals, our economies continue to suffer the effects of \nthe international economic and financial crisis, which \ncreate barriers to economic growth and hinder the \nimplementation of programmes to combat poverty and \nimprove the living conditions of our peoples. However, \nwe note with satisfaction that the African continent \nhas ceased to present the image of desolation it did at \nthe beginning of the millennium. A new reality has \nemerged in which African countries boast an average \ngrowth of 5 per cent per year and improvements in \nseveral human development indicators. We believe that \nthe trend of progress will prevail in the near future, \nand we will do everything to make it so by investing in \nfuture generations on the basis of the objectives of the \nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development, the post-\n2015 road map and the African Agenda 2063.\n\nAngola is implementing its National Development \nPlan 2013-2017, which aims to increase the supply of \nsocial services to the population, diversify the economy \nand consolidate macroeconomic stability, thus laying \nthe foundation for the process of graduation to a \nmiddle-income country.\n\nAngola reiterates the need to end the economic and \nfinancial embargo imposed on Cuba, which limits the \nright of the Cuban people to development and is a clear \nviolation of the principles and rules of international law.\n\nFinally, we appreciate and have been touched by \nthe support that Angola has received from numerous \ncountries for its candidature to be a non-permanent \nmember of the Security Council for the 2015-2016 \nbiennium, elections for which will place during the \nAssembly\u2019s present session. Once elected to that \nimportant organ, we will work with partners in the \nCouncil to seek solutions to the serious problems \nfacing the international community and to make a real \ncontribution to peace and security in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to greet the \nGeneral Assembly and to confess how deeply moved \nI feel to be here. For those who have never spoken in \nthe Assembly Hall, it remains a place of extraordinary \nfascination and appeal. For those who have become \naccustomed to being in such halls, they may consider \nit as something already seen and experienced. For \nsomeone like me, who is in the Hall for the first time \ntoday, the emotion is overwhelming to find oneself in \nthe place where there is a sense of still being able to \nbuild a horizon of human rights, respect, freedom and \npeace. I feel the emotion of the future in a place where \na great Secretary-General, Mr. Dag Hammarskj.ld, had \nthe strength, the vision and the intuition to design a \ndifferent world. For those, like us, who grew up with that \nmodel, the statement \u201cFor all that has been \u2014 thanks. \nFor all that shall be \u2014 yes\u201d, which Dag Hammarskj.ld \nwrote in his diary, the United Nations was something \nmore than a political programme, it was the very idea \nof a definition of politics.\n\nYet today, the future appears threatening. The \nfuture is frightening. The future is no longer promising. \nWe want to believe that it is possible to return to the \nidea of tomorrow. It is the dream of the United Nations \nto return to the goal of preserving future generations \nfrom the horrors of war. Today, however, we must \nhave the courage also to say, when looking back at the \nhistory of the Organization, that the errors of the past \ncannot be erased. The year 2015 is the year in which we \nwill recall the twentieth anniversary of what happened \nin Srebrenica, when international institutions remained \nsilent before one of the worst massacres and genocides \nthat still today finds no justification. That is why we \nneed to repeat in this Hall today that it is time for \npolitics to return to finding a definition of a future of \nhope.\n\nMy generation grew up hearing that history had \nended, that the century that had just passed was a short \ncentury in which we had already seen everything. But \nhistory has not ended, the century we have left behind us \nwas not short, and today, we must say that the political \nway is the only way to prevent the bloodletting that \nis causing so much grief in the Mediterranean, in the \nMiddle East, in Ukraine and in many regions of Africa.\n\nBecause of its central location, Italy has the will and \nthe need to play a greater role in the Mediterranean. Italy, \nwhose gift to the world is the image of the city and the \npublic square \u2014 in the sense of an open gathering place \nfor the community \u2014 cannot be silent when confronted \nwith the transformation of the Mediterranean, which \nshould be the heart of Europe and the public square for \ndiscussion and confrontation, but has all too often been \ntransformed into a cemetery.\n\nI take the floor today one year after the Italian \nGovernment launched an important operation called \nMare Nostrum. Thanks to that operation, I can stand \nbefore the Assembly and say that the men and women \nof the Italian Coast Guard and volunteer services have \nsaved 80,000 human lives, 80,000 people who could \nbecome doctors, musicians, workers, 80,000 people \n\n\n\f\nwho were pulled from the Mediterranean as if from a \ncemetery, thanks to an operation that we take pride in \nbut that cannot be left only to Italy today. We need to \nsay forcefully that intervention in the Mediterranean \narea is a strategic intervention for the international \ncommunity that cannot only be left to a single force.\n\nIn saying that, we need to add that the priority \nfor that area today is Libya and our friends, the \nLibyan people, who are suffering through a time of \ntransition that seems never to end. We are committed \nnot to underestimate a hot spot in the midst of the \nMediterranean that could reach a point of no return in \na spiral of violence and instability in the region. Italy \nwill continue to do its part, but we must emphasize \nwith decisiveness and intensity in this prestigious \nforum that the risk of a gradual fragmentation of \nLibya and the negative consequences that that would \ntrigger for the entire North African region would be \ncatastrophic for peace and stability in the entire region. \nWe are committed to supporting a strong and stable \nLibya, and we will continue to work with the Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Libya \nthrough our embassy, which is still open, but we want \nto say with great determination that the situation in \nLibya must be a priority for all.\n\nAnother priority, especially for those today who \nare preparing for a discussion on the terrorist threat in \nthe Middle East and elsewhere, is to be aware that the \nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as was said \nyesterday with great force, is not just a terrorist threat \nto a specific region, but a risk for the entire community \nof men and women who would call themselves human. \nWe are not dealing with a form of religious expression. \nReligions can both fuel the fires of a conflict and \nprovide water to heal wounds. We believe that ISIL and \nthe threat it represents are not connected in the slightest \nway with a conflict of religions.\n\nAt the same time, we say forcefully that those of \nus who had the duty \u2014 or the good fortune, if I may \nspeak provocatively \u2014 to visit a refugee camp, as I \ndid in the second half of August in Erbil, Kurdistan, in \nIraq, will realize that we cannot be unresponsive to the \ndismayed faces of so many victims of fanaticism. To see \nan international aid worker who shows you images on \nher cellphone of children who were executed, who were \nlined up against a wall and shot; to hear stories about \nyoung women taken to barracks in the centre of Mosul \nand forced, in silence and powerlessness, to satisfy \nall the desires of violent terrorists; to think of what is \nhappening to journalists and hostages \u2014 requires us \nto say what must be said. A genocide is under way, \nand in the face of such activities, we know that only a \nunified international community can win this battle of \ncivilization against evil. That is why I said yesterday \nto President Obama that the international coalition can \ncount on Italy\u2019s support to eliminate the threat posed \nby ISIL, and I continue to insist on the fact that the \ncommitment of our country in every region and in \nevery area of the region will be resolute and, I hope, \ndecisive.\n\nItaly has contributed and will continue to contribute \nin Lebanon, through our soldiers and their commitment \nto supporting the United Nations peacekeeping mission \ndeployed in the south of Lebanon. I would take this \nopportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to those \nwomen and men who, from Lebanon to Afghanistan, \nwear the uniform of our country to make a concrete \ncommitment to ensuring stability and peace. But at \nthe same time, I know, we know, that there will be \nno peace in the region until what a great prophet of \nItalian political thought, Giorgio La Pira, called the \n\u201cpeace of the children of Abraham\u201d has brought an \nend to the unresolved conflict between the Israelis and \nPalestinians.\n\nWe will never tire of seeking peace for Jerusalem, \nand a ceasefire in Gaza will be consolidated and \nrespected only if we all recognize the two-State \nsolution and the right of the Palestinian people to \nfinally have a homeland. As I have said before and I \nrepeat here, it is not only a right but a duty for Israel \nto exist \u2014 for the sake of history, memory, innovation, \ndemocracy, freedom, of which the Israeli people give \nconstant proof. The entire international community \nmust support that process. Those words must be clearly \nheard in this Hall, where someone once dared to call \ninto question the very right of Israel to exist.\n\nIt is dialogue and politics that can prevent a return \nto the dialectics of the cold war. We had thought that \nthose times were behind us, but now the tensions on \nthe eastern borders of Ukraine risk are jeopardizing \nthe greatest achievement of the European integration \nprocess \u2014 a continent of peace and stability. Never \nbefore had there been such a long period of peace as the \none we are experiencing today in Europe.\n\nBut the crisis in Ukraine has forced us to confront \nunexpected challenges. I believe that there is a \nconnection between two fundamental principles \u2014 the \nright of the Ukrainian people to have the territorial \n\n\nunity of their country recognized in the face of acts of \naggression that have violated its integrity, and at the \nsame time, I hope that we can overcome the tensions \nwith the Russian Federation, which will, I hope, return \nto playing its role as a global stakeholder so needed by \nthe international community.\n\nA great expert in politics from the Italian \nRenaissance, Niccol\u00f2 Macchiavelli, wrote, \u201cTo know \nhow to recognize an opportunity in war and take is \nof greater benefit than anything else\u201d. Macchiavelli\u2019s \nwords helps us understand in this moment that the Minsk \nAgreement is a great opportunity in the war under way \nin Ukraine. We must seize this opportunity for the \npeople of Ukraine and the international community.\n\nDialogue and reconciliation are indispensable \ntools in the Sudan, Somalia and in the Central African \nregion. They are the strong point of our community as \nit faces newly emerging difficulties, starting with the \nEbola virus and its dramatic humanitarian, social and \neconomic consequences. Italy is doing its part and will \ncontinue to do so, following the Secretary-General\u2019s \nleadership and inspiration, whom I thank for his prompt \naction.\n\nBut I should also emphasize that political solutions \nare the only way forward for the year 2015, although \nthey are often marked by complex, difficult challenges. \nProblems to be solved include the challenge of achieving \nnew global governance of the Internet, as the President \nof Brazil mentioned yesterday (see A/69/PV.6), and \nthe challenge of finally making a major investment \nin gender equality, so that we no longer consider it \nnewsworthy when a woman takes on a position of \nresponsibility. I am very proud to say that for the first \ntime in its history, women make up more than half of \nmy Government. I am happy and pleased to say that we \nwill never fall short in our commitment to leadership \nroles for women, but above all we will fight to ensure \nthat young women can be free in developing countries \nand nations facing especially difficult situations.\n\nI cannot emphasize strongly enough that 2015 will \nbe a very important year in the fight against religious \ndiscrimination. Every religious minority has the right \nto be defended. Never before have so many Christians \nbeen killed in regions around the world because of their \nfaith, and never before has one of the genuine tragedies \nof our times been so badly underestimated. Within the \ninternational community it is especially vital that we \nforcefully affirm the values of equality, respect and \ntolerance, which are of special relevance for us in Italy \nwhen talking about the death penalty. That is why this \nnew session of the General Assembly coincides with \nthe presentation of a new draft resolution on abolishing \ncapital punishment. I hope that the number of countries \nsupporting it will continue to grow.\n\nI would like to say that I am especially excited to \nbe able to speak about that on behalf of Italy, which \nhas always fought at both the governmental and the \nnon-governmental levels to make that issue a priority. \nEarlier in my career, I was mayor of the city of Florence, \nwhich was the first place in history to abolish the death \npenalty. A herald descended the steps of the Palazzo \nVecchio to announce that in that State, the Grand \nDuchy, the death penalty had been abolished. Let us \nnot pile more barbarous acts on other ones. I ask every \nState to join us in this battle for civilization.\n\nThe year 2015 will also be an important one for \nthe Expo in Milan and the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Paris, which we discussed two \ndays ago, and for actions that remind us of the need \nfor a turning point, such as in the debate over Security \nCouncil reform. We all believe that the Council must \nbe made more effective, representative, transparent \nand accountable to the members of the international \ncommunity. But opinions on how to achieve that goal \nstill differ. In order to bring the various reform models \ncloser together, the Uniting for Consensus group, to \nwhich my country belongs, continues to maintain that \ncreating new permanent members would imperil that \ngoal, and I reiterate our willingness to find compromise \nsolutions.\n\nI believe that it is crucial that all those challenges \nbe seen as subsumed within the greatest challenge of \nthem all, one in which we must all be on the front lines. \nThere can be no peace, no freedom, no respect until \nthe international community puts at the centre of its \nstrategy a gigantic, grand investment into education, \nschools, universities, going from house to house, \nvillage to village, piazza to piazza. We say that the \nmost powerful weapon in affirming the values of peace \nand freedom is the weapon of education, of culture, \nof human capital, of investment in people and in the \nstories and freedoms of individual women and men.\n\nThat is why I believe that, while we are living in \ndifficult times, we are also living in a time when we \nmust, as former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld \nput it, say yes to the future. He also said, \u201cWe are not \npermitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what \nwe put into it is ours\u201d. We are not permitted to choose \n\n\nthe frame of our destiny. We are living in a time of \nthreats and problems. Yet what we can put into it is \nentirely ours. Within this frame of our destiny we can \nonce again inspire others with the values of education, \nfreedom and peace, so long as we are stay true to our \nhistory and hopeful for our future.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like to \ncongratulate President Kutesa on his well-deserved \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. His distinguished career \nas a diplomat and leader assures us of a successful \nsession. I would also like to commend his predecessor, \nAmbassador John Ashe, for his remarkable leadership \nduring the previous session.\n\nOver the 69 years of its existence, the United Nations \nhas witnessed several changes in the configuration of \ninternational relations. Some were traumatic, others \nbenign. The survival of the Organization through \nall those tribulations testifies to its resilience and \nthe enduring validity of its mission. Today it is still \nconfronted by serious challenges. The continuous \neruption of armed conflicts throughout the world, \nterrorism, climate change, disease and the lingering \neffects of the economic and financial crises are only \nsome of the challenges that have remained in the \nforeground of international relations and preoccupied \nthe international community.\n\nFrom the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel \nregion, to the Republic of Kenya and the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, the continent of Africa is facing \na rise in terrorism. The Nigeria-based Boko Haram, \nAl-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Shabaab in \nSomalia continue to pose serious threats to the peace \nand security of the continent. The emergence in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere of new extremist groups and \nterrorist entities, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria, has not only further compounded the problem \nbut is a stark reminder that we must act collectively \nto discharge the moral responsibility resting on us to \nensure that people everywhere enjoy the right to peace, \ndevelopment and the sanctity of life.\n\nThe use of military force alone as a strategy for \ncombating terrorism is no longer a panacea for that \nmenace. Terrorism requires a holistic approach that \naddresses the root causes of the scourge. The resolution \nof international disputes based on dialogue, justice and \nthe equality of all States must be at the heart of that \nstrategy if it is to succeed.\n\nThe recurring bloody conflict between Israel and \nPalestine continues to weigh heavily on the conscience \nof all humankind. Recent developments in that region \nhave cast a shadow on the future that had seemed \nto hold out the promise of a negotiated settlement. \nUnprecedented impunity and the disproportionate \nuse of force by the parties involved call into question \nour very claim to be a civilization. Turning United \nNations shelters into combat zones and killing the \ninnocent children, men and women who take refuge in \nthem is a shameful act that must be condemned in the \nstrongest terms possible. Lesotho endorses the recent \nHuman Rights Council resolution S-21/1, demanding \nthat the massacres of innocent Palestinian civilians be \ninvestigated by an independent commission and that \nthose responsible be held accountable.\n\nLet us not forget that in 2005 we unanimously \nadopted the principle of the responsibility to protect \n(see resolution 60/1, paragraphs 138-140) in order \nto safeguard innocent civilians from war crimes, \n\n\n\f\ngenocide, mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing. Indeed, \nthe Security Council has reaffirmed that principle in \nseveral conflicts around the world and in some instances \nhas authorized military intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, in the case of the slaughter of \nthousands of Palestinian civilians, the Council has \nshied away from invoking the principle of responsibility \nto protect. Instead, it took comfort in issuing a \npresidential statement that glaringly fails to reiterate \naccountability for the war crimes committed. Civilians \nin Gaza deserve the protection that Israelis in Tel \nAviv are afforded under international law. We call on \nIsrael \u2014 as we have always done in the past \u2014 to fully \ncomply with its obligations under the relevant Security \nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions. That is the \nonly plausible route to lasting peace.\n\nThe world has long come to terms with the dangers \nto humanity posed by the possession of weapons of \nmass destruction. That is why Lesotho continues to \nadvocate for total abolition and destruction of all \nnuclear weapons. Those weapons have no place in \nmodern-day civilized society, hence the call for a \nconvention to ban them all. While working towards \nthat goal, we must emphasize that full compliance with \nthe provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons is critical. By the same token, \nwe call for the establishment of a Middle East zone \nfree of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the 2010 \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nIt is unacceptable that the United Nations of today \nstill reflects the 1945 architecture of the world as seen \nby the victors of the Second World War. The reform of \nthe United Nations, including the Security Council, can \nno longer be delayed. A reformed, transparent and more \ndemocratic United Nations is necessary for preserving \ninternational peace and security and for confronting \nthe challenges of development. All Member States need \nto garner the necessary political will to advance the \nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \nreform. Let us make the sixth-ninth session one for \ndecisive action.\n\nThe representatives who gathered in San Francisco \nto finalize the Charter of the United Nations dreamed of \na world of peace and shared prosperity. They renounced \na vision of a world in which some unilaterally imposed \neconomic sanctions and financial blockades against \nothers, or one in which peoples were denied their right \nto self-determination or were subjected to occupation, \nas is the case in Cuba, Palestine and Western Sahara. \nWe have to remove those dark spots on the history of \nour time by allowing the letter and spirit of the Charter \nto guide our actions.\n\nThe theme chosen for our general debate, \n\u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative \npost-2015 development agenda\u201d, could not be more \nrelevant at the current international juncture. The \nroad towards the achievement of all the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has been rough, with some \ncountries reporting relative success in reducing poverty \nand hunger, markedly increasing school enrolment, \nreducing child mortality, improving maternal health \nand combating HIV/AIDS. However, the challenges \nremain most daunting in the least developed countries, \nlandlocked developing countries, some small island \ndeveloping States and countries in, or emerging from, \nconflict.\n\nFor our part, in Lesotho we have made some \nprogress towards achieving at least two of the eight \nMDGs, namely, universal primary education, and \npromoting gender equality and empowering women. \nWe still face a long and uphill journey to reach a life \nof dignity for all. HIV and AIDS still pose a serious \nthreat to us. The untold miseries brought about by that \nscourge are known to all of us. Africa is more vulnerable \nto that threat because of the worsening poverty and \nunemployment. Sadly, new, incurable pandemics such \nas Ebola have emerged, wreaking havoc in sister African \ncountries and overwhelming their health systems. The \nworld must mobilize resources and energy to help the \naffected countries of West Africa fight the pandemic \nand to abolish it in the long term.\n\nOur quest to pursue a sustainable future for \nall must never wane as we step into the new era and \nembark on the road map of the post-2015 development \nagenda. We need to formulate a new set of universal \nsustainable development goals that are concise and \nstrong with regard to the means of implementation. It is \nimportant to emphasize national ownership and respect \nfor national conditions in each Member State and to \ntake advantage of global diversity so that we can attain \nour development aspirations.\n\nAs we continue with intergovernmental discussions \nleading up to the Third International Conference \non Financing for Development, which will be held \nin Addis Ababa in July 2015, we must be guided by \nthe spirit of frankness and mutual understanding, \nwithout the acrimony that often characterizes \n\n\n\f\nour intergovernmental deliberations. It is equally \nimportant to emphasize that advancing the rule of law \nat the national and international levels is essential for \nrealizing sustainable development, eradicating poverty \nand protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nLesotho is by no means an exception in that regard.\n\nA few days ago, the Climate Summit provided \nus with an opportunity once again to reaffirm our \ncollective resolve to implement measures that can \nsignificantly address climate change. We disagreed for \nfar too long, until we were confronted by the glaring and \ncompelling scientific evidence that the link between \nglobal warming and human activity is indisputable. \nSadly, catastrophes have begun to hit, mostly affecting \nthe poorest and most vulnerable countries.\n\nMy country is one of the worst affected by climate \nchange. In recent years, Lesotho has faced unsettling \ndevelopment challenges due to the effects of climate \nchange. The effects of increasing extreme weather \npatterns such as early frost, droughts, desertification \nand degradation of arable land compound the challenges \nthat we are already facing. Livelihoods of societies are \nstifled, and economies and ways of life are negatively \naffected.\n\nWhile we appreciate that there are resources aimed \nat helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt \nto the impacts of climate change, we are concerned \nthat such funds are difficult to access. The global \nclimate-finance architecture is complex, with variable \nstructures of governance and modalities. Some finance \nis channelled through multilateral agencies, sometimes \neven outside the funding mechanisms of the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nand some flows through bilateral development- \nassistance institutions, thereby making coordination \nvery difficult. Lesotho calls on the international \ncommunity and our development partners to simplify \nthe accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change \ninitiatives if we are to make an impact on the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, let me point out that the regime of the \nCharter of the United Nations has so far done its part in \npreventing a third world war, thereby fulfilling one of \nthe dreams of the architects of our beloved Organization. \nThe continued success and the relevance of the United \nNations in the new millennium will depend, in large \nmeasure, on its capacity for self-renewal in readiness to \nmeet modern-day challenges.\n\nWe, the United Nations, should continue to be \nthe voice of the voiceless and the best hope for all \nhumankind. Now is the time for leaders everywhere to \njoin the race for transformative action that can drive \npeace, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule \nof law, human dignity, economic competitiveness and \nsustainable prosperity for all. Lesotho will and must \ncontinue to be a persistent and resilient part of that \ninitiative.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of Belize, it is with great \npleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I would also like to take this opportunity to \nregister Belize\u2019s thanks to your predecessor, our own \nson of Caribbean soil, Mr. John Ashe, who performed \nhis duties superbly this past year and leaves the \nOrganization a legacy of lasting value.\n\nMr. President, your chosen theme for this \nyear\u2019s session, \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, \nis ambitious, hopeful and challenging, and Belize \ncommends you on its selection. In the next 12 months, \nwe will closely monitor and contribute to its crafting \nand evolution. The stated goal of the new agenda is \nto promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, \nsafeguard the future of our planet and lead to the \n\nachievement of sustainable development, with the \neradication of poverty and hunger at its core.\n\nBelize views those outcomes as more than \naspirational. For us they are imperatives. Failure to \nattain them will have dire consequences for our nation \nand people. They call for a transformative mobilization \nof our societies at the organic level. For that to happen, \nwe must inspire and equip every actor in our societies \nwith the requisite tools for tackling their responsibilities \nand partaking in the dividends of sustainable economic \ngrowth with equity and social justice.\n\nThe experiences we have had in seeking to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals, however, make \nus less than sanguine that we will have more success \nwith the post-2015 development agenda than we have \nhad in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe are mindful that the support that some developed \nMember States pledged to provide for our efforts with \nthe Millennium Development Goals did not materialize \nin the amounts that were pledged and needed. On the \nwhole, small countries like my own are disadvantaged \nby their lack of the resources and human, financial, \nscientific and technological capacities that are \nprerequisites for succeeding with such ambitious and \ncomplex initiatives. Without cooperation and support \nfor addressing those needs from the developed States \nMembers of the United Nations and other multilateral \nagencies and, crucially, through reform of the policies \nof the international financial institutions, Belize\u2019s \nattainment of the post-2015 development agenda will \nbe severely hampered.\n\nLooking to the future, Belize welcomes and \nsupports the Assembly\u2019s adoption at its sixty-\neighth session of resolution 68/304, \u201cTowards the \nestablishment of a multilateral legal framework for \nsovereign debt restructuring processes\u201d, and hopes \nit will result in a robust multilateral treaty that will \nincrease the efficiency, stability and predictability \nof the international financial system. In the wake of \nthe world\u2019s financial meltdown in 2008 and the many \ndisasters that have occurred around the world over \nthe past six years, necessitating large outlays of donor \nfunding to assist the victims of such disasters, there \nare unmistakable and troubling indications of donor \nfatigue and a tendency towards isolationism and self-\ncentredness in our global environment, a trend that does \nnot augur well for financing the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nBelize nonetheless remains cautiously optimistic. \nWe are encouraged by the pilgrimage to this Hall over \nthe past week of world leaders from nations large and \nsmall, friends and foes, allies and enemies. Each spoke \nfrom this very rostrum, and each in essence voluntarily \nreaffirmed the conviction of their respective countries \nthat collective action under these United Nations offers \nour world the only true hope of dealing successfully \nwith the myriad problems currently afflicting \nmankind, whether climate change, the dreaded Ebola \nvirus, religious fanaticism, or persistent poverty and \nunderdevelopment.\n\nOf those maladies, Belize regards climate change as \nthe most pernicious. While a global consensus seems to \nhave finally been reached as to the causes, as well as the \ncure, for this apocalyptic phenomenon, the political will \nof the major emitters to take immediate, concerted and \ndecisive action to combat it is still absent. Indeed, just as \nour international community was grievously dilatory in \ntaking prompt collective action to prevent the genocidal \nmassacre in Rwanda or the current spread of the Ebola \nvirus in Africa, so the major emitters are being dilatory \nin confronting the challenges of climate change. It is \nevident that the threats that epidemics, pandemics and \nterrorism pose to our planet and humankind pale into \ninsignificance when compared to the existential threats \nof climate change. Furthermore, it is equally evident \nthat it would not be hyperbole to opine that time is \nnot on our side. Horrendous devastation \u2014 caused by \nextreme droughts, huge conflagrations in our forests, \nintense rainfall, floods, hurricanes, melting snowcaps, \nwarming seas and sea-level rises, and an awful and \nfrightening increase in pestilence and diseases \u2014 is \nalready occurring around the world.\n\nAmong other things, my own country, Belize, is \nalready experiencing coral bleaching, coastal erosion \nand flooding, and it is forecast that next year the entire \ncountry will be visited by severe drought. The cost of \nmitigating the damage that is already being done to my \ncountry and of adapting to climate change is prohibitive. \nIt is time for the large competing emitters to put aside \ntheir mutual suspicion and commit to capping global \nwarming at 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. While my \ncountry appreciates the pledges that have already been \nmade to the Green Climate Fund, the amount of money \nneeded to address global warming is exponentially \nlarger. We do, however, remain optimistic that a robust \nclimate change agreement will be signed in Paris in \n2015.\n\nThe development and security needs of nations \nlarge and small in this era of globalization have hastened \nthe imperative of regional integration. Indeed, today \nit is virtually impossible for any nation to function \nsuccessfully on its own in any sphere of activity. In my \nown country\u2019s case, the measure of development and \nsecurity we have enjoyed over the past 33 years, since \ngaining independence, must be credited in large part to \nthe good relations we continue to have with our partners \nin the various regional integration groupings to which \nwe belong and the excellent cooperation programmes \nwe share with our bilateral and multilateral partners, \nprominent among which are the various agencies of \nthe United Nations. However, even as we acknowledge \nwith gratitude the tremendous contributions of our \npartners to our nation\u2019s security and development, \nour Government is ever mindful that the primary \nresponsibility for it rests with our Government and \npeople. In that conviction, and given our limited \nresources, our Government has had to prioritize its \nareas of intervention. It has concentrated on providing \nour nation\u2019s basic needs \u2014 security, housing, education, \nhealth care, employment and wealth generation.\n\nHighest on that list of priorities is the importance \nof safeguarding our country\u2019s security and territorial \nintegrity. Successive Belizean Governments have \ninvested heavily in efforts to bring about a peaceful \nresolution of the Guatemalan territorial claim over our \ncountry. Our Government is unalterably wedded to the \npeaceful resolution of this claim by adjudication at the \nInternational Court of Justice. We have enlisted the \nsupport of all our international friends and partners for \nthat decision, and the Guatemalan Government is also \ncommitted, through the Special Agreement of 2008, to \nthe resolution of the claim by the International Court \nof Justice.\n\nWe are convinced that wars and rumours of war \nand any kind of international conflict will only bring \ngrief and cause pain, hardship and devastation. That is \nwhy we keep working assiduously with our neighbours \nin the region to cement friendly, peaceful, collaborative \nand productive relations in order to achieve development \nfor our people. Belize is very pleased by the recent \ndesignation by the Community of Latin American \nand Caribbean States of our entire region as a zone of \npeace. We also welcome your own call, Mr. President, \nfor the intensification of efforts towards the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes.\n\nDomestically, Belize has enjoyed uninterrupted \npeace and harmony for the past 33 years. Our \nGovernment acts with alacrity and sensitivity to \ndefuse any situation that has the potential for civil \nstrife and disorder, and we invest substantially in our \nsecurity forces, in terms of both capacity-building \nand equipment and transportation. In our quest for \nwealth generation, job creation and the attainment of \nsustainable development, Belize is pursuing, inter \nalia, the prescriptions articulated in our Horizon \n2030 national development plan. In that regard, our \nGovernment is working in close concert with economic \ndevelopment experts from the International Monetary \nFund, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development \nBank and other institutions.\n\nAmong the initiatives we are pursuing is a \ncomprehensive programme of infrastructure works \nthroughout our country, which includes the upgrading \nand expanding of major highways; the paving of streets \nin cities and towns; the installation of new drains in \nflood-prone areas; and the construction and upgrading \nof sporting stadiums and recreational community \nbuildings. Those programmes are being executed at a \ntotal cost of $100 million.\n\nThanks to the collaboration of the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela and the tremendous support \nwe receive through the Petrocaribe initiative, our \nGovernment has been able to invest in infrastructure \nand social programmes to the benefit of all our citizens. \nOur Government is cognizant of the importance of \ngood infrastructure to our economic development. \nBelize is a major exporter of primary products. All our \nagri-products are transported by road from the farms \nto the factories and then to the sea ports for export. \nThe aquaculture products and petroleum products we \nproduce are also transported by road to our seaports. All \nour archaeological sites and many of our tourist resorts \nare also only accessible by road. It is the expectation \nof our Government that, with the enhancement of our \nnetwork of streets and roads, our country will become \nmore attractive to both residents and foreigners, be they \ntourists or investors, and that this will translate into a \nrapid expansion in productivity, economic growth and \nwealth generation.\n\nWith a view to ensuring that as many Belizean \nworkers as possible obtain employment in the \ninfrastructure works being carried out, the Government \nhas requested all contractors who successfully bid \nfor the works to utilize manual labour wherever it is \n\nfeasible to do so. The works are providing employment \nfor many Belizean youth, both male and female.\n\n\nAs a further initiative to stimulate economic \ndevelopment, our Government inaugurated the very \nfirst National Bank of Belize one year ago. The Bank \nstarted out modestly. It commenced operations by \nproviding loans primarily to finance the acquisition of \nhomes for middle-class Belizeans. Though the Bank is \nlimited in its offerings, its establishment has resulted \nin an immediate and dramatic reduction of the interest \nrates being charged by commercial banks in the country \non similar loans. That is a welcome development and \na goal that our Government had tried for many years \nto achieve without success. The new Bank is rapidly \nbuilding up its customer base and has now started to \naccept deposits. The prospect for young employed \nBelizeans to own their own homes at affordable \nmortgages is now greatly increased. Very many \nBelizeans are already landed property owners, thanks \nto an ongoing programme by successive Governments \nto make land available to them at minimal costs.\n\nOur Government is also aggressively promoting \nforeign direct investment. We have successfully \nattracted investment in petroleum extraction, \nagribusiness, renewable energy, tourism and business \nprocesses outsourcing.\n\nOn our Independence Day, 21 September 1981, \nBelize inherited an educational system that was \ndesigned to educate citizens for the needs of a remote \ncolonial outpost in the industrial age, the primary \neconomic activity of which was the export of timber \nand sugar. We have since been making strenuous \nefforts to transform that system into one capable of \nsatisfying the needs of an independent nation in this, \nthe twenty-first century and the information age. That \nis proving to be a task fraught with great difficulty. It \nis also an exceedingly expensive one. Our Government \ncurrently spends 26 per cent of our national budget on \nthe education sector. However, that is not nearly enough \nto cover the cost of the training and education needs \nof our young nation. We appreciate, however, that the \nquality of our workforce will be a great determinant in \nour future development, and that we must therefore do \nall in our power to make our workforce the very best it \ncan be regardless of the cost and without heeding the \nsacrifices we will undoubtedly have to make.\n\nTo that end, our Government is engaged in a \nnumber of initiatives aimed at training and educating \nour population. Among those is a comprehensive \nteacher training and certification programme. We are \nresolved to have only teachers trained in pedagogy \nand in the various subject areas that they are expected \nto teach in our classrooms. Simultaneously, we are \nassiduously expanding our education coverage from the \npre-primary to the tertiary levels. Indeed, more young \npeople today than at any other time in the history of our \nnation can afford to obtain an education and can find \nspace in an educational institution near their homes. We \nare also placing increasing emphasis on vocational and \ntechnical education and training and on the teaching of \nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics. We \nare in the planning stage for a new institute of science \nand technology, and we are expanding the presence of \ncentres for employment training across the country.\n\nBecause we possess only two young universities, we \nmake strenuous efforts to gain access to universities and \nother advanced educational institutions abroad for those \nof our students who successfully attain the matriculation \nrequirements for entry into those institutions. We \nhave been very successful in that initiative. The vast \nmajority of our students attend those universities on \nscholarships, thanks to the generosity of our cooperation \npartners. Every Belizean student, male and female, \nwho attains the requisite matriculation requirement \nhas an equal opportunity to win a scholarship. Current \ndata indicate that our female students are much more \nsuccessful at winning scholarships than their male \ncounterparts. Our initiatives in the education sector are \ncontributing greatly to the increase in the competence \nof our workforce at every level, thereby enabling it \nto produce goods and services that are competitive in \nthe world markets. In order to continue our efforts in \nthat regard, we will need the continued support of the \nUnited Nations and its formidable network.\n\nBelize currently spends over 13 per cent of the \nnational budget on the health sector. We seek to develop \nand maintain a healthy and productive population. To \nthat end, our Government is expanding school food \nprogrammes countrywide and programmes that allow \nparents of low-income families to purchase food items \nat concessionary rates. We know that regular, balanced \nmeals are vital to the health of our population and that \nit is much less expensive to keep our population healthy \nthan it is to cure it when it is ill.\n\nWe continue to strengthen our primary health-care \nnetwork. We continuously upgrade facilities in our \nhospital and clinics with modern diagnostic equipment. \nOur flagship public hospital is now benefiting from \na significant technological upgrade. We also recently \ninaugurated a brand-new neonatal wing at that hospital. \nFor the first time in our country\u2019s history, a state-of-\nthe-art facility to cater exclusively to the health needs \nof our physically challenged children has been built. \nThis facility is the brainchild of the wife of our Prime \nMinister, who serves as a Special Envoy for Women and \nChildren in Belize. She spearheaded both the raising of \nthe finances for its construction and the supervision of \nits construction.\n\nWe take this opportunity also to applaud the \nefforts of our Special Envoy who, just a few days ago, \nhosted one of the largest gatherings of First Ladies \nand Spouses of Heads of State and Government on the \nsubject of the empowerment of women and girls, here at \nthe United Nations. That special event was a universal \ncall to action on the financial health of women and girls \nbased on the Beijing Platform for Action. We call on \nall Governments and international organizations to \nsupport that worthy cause.\n\nBelize expanded the coverage of our health \ninsurance scheme in the last budget year and, through \nour cooperation agreement with the Republic of Cuba, \nwe are significantly increasing the number of our \nhealth-care personnel. Indeed, only some three weeks \nago we welcomed a contingent of some 35 newly \ntrained Belizean doctors \u2014 the largest contingent of \ndoctors ever to return to our country in a single year. \nOur citizens are our nation\u2019s most valuable resource. \nWe are resolved to invest in them, to enhance their \ncompetences and to ameliorate the quality of life of \neach and every one of them.\n\nThe victims of global strife and global tragedies \nare invariably human beings. The United Nations was \nfounded on the determination that no other generation \nwould have to suffer the scourge of war, which we all \nknow brings nothing but death, destruction and sorrow \nto humankind. Our compact is to promote and protect \nfundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of \nthe human person \u2014 all human persons of all nations, \nlarge and small.\n\nThe devastating Ebola virus is increasing \nexponentially and frighteningly. While we are \ndisappointed that international health agencies did not \nrespond more vigorously and with greater alacrity to \nthe Ebola outbreak many months ago, Belize welcomes \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s United Nations Mission for \nEbola Emergency Response.\n\nBelize endorses without reservation the call for \nthe Republic of Taiwan to be permitted to participate \nin the specialized agencies of the United Nations. In \nthis modern day and age, it is incomprehensible that \nwe should want to deny ourselves the benefit of their \nexpertise in dealing with global issues.\n\nIf we are to remain true to the principle of inclusion \nas enshrined in our Charter and as promoted in the \npost-2015 development agenda, we must continue to \nadvocate for the right of the Sahrawi people for self-\ndetermination.\n\nThe indiscriminate killing, maiming and \ndestruction recently meted out to innocent Palestinian \ncivilians, especially helpless women and children, \nand their possessions, were an affront to decency, \nmorality and humanity. We reiterate our support for \nthe resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by \ndiplomatic means and for the coexistence of the State \nof Israel and the State of Palestine in peace and security \nin their respective pre-1967 international borders, as \nrecognized by the international community.\n\nBelize is convinced that any discussion of a future \ndevelopment agenda must include the removal of \nunilateral harmful practices that stifle and stagnate \ndevelopment, wherever they occur. In that respect, we \njoin the rest of the international community in calling \nfor an end to the anachronistic embargo against Cuba.\n\nBelize recognizes that foremost among our \ndevelopment priorities is to ensure the sustainability of \nthe environment, in keeping with our flagship status as \na haven for democracy, the promotion and protection \nof human rights and environmental conservation. We \nembrace the principle that economic growth should \nnot come at any cost. However, neither should our \npeople have to forgo development to protect the natural \nenvironment. We firmly believe that it is a false \ndichotomy to pit development against the environment. \nThat is why we fully welcome and embrace the principle \nof sustainable development. Our future and the world\u2019s \ndepend on the entire globe embracing the sustainable \ndevelopment approach.\n"

        "file_text": "I join those who have \nspoken before me in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa on \nhis assumption of the office of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. Like them, I am \nconfident that, under his leadership, the sixty-ninth session \n\nwill be productive. I would also like to express Fiji\u2019s \ngratitude for the leadership of Mr. John Ashe throughout \nthe sixty-eighth session.\n\nFive years ago, I stood in this great Hall and promised \nthe global community that my Government would introduce \nthe first genuine democracy in Fiji\u2019s history before the end \nof September (see A/64/PV.10). It is my honour to inform \nthe Assembly that, with the support of the Fijian people, \nI have kept that promise. I return to the Assembly today \nas the duly elected Prime Minister of the Republic of \nFiji. At our general election on 17 September, I led my \nFiji First political movement to a decisive victory in \nthe first election to be held under our new Constitution \non the basis of equal votes of equal value. The new \nConstitution replaced the three previous constitutions \nsince our independence from Britain in 1970, in \nwhich Governments were chosen under a weighted \nand discriminatory formula that separated the various \ncommunities and favoured some citizens over others.\n\nFor nearly four decades, we laboured under a system \nthat was undemocratic, unjust and unfair. Indeed, we \nwere a case study of a nation that was supposedly \ndemocratic and casting itself as such, but was failing \nto meet some basic democratic standards \u2014 a common \nand equal citizenry, a common identity and a level \nplaying field on which every citizen can excel. We \nhave often heard it said that elections are key to having \ndemocracy. We in Fiji knew that that was not the case, \nbecause our electoral system, before it was reformed, \ndid not give us true democracy. It did not facilitate \njustice, transparency or good governance. It was about \nreinforcing power, the power of elites, and keeping the \npopulation divided into different communal groups. \nThat weighted system perpetuated injustice for a great \nmany of our people, created different classes of citizens \nand encouraged corruption. It was a system that no \nadvanced democracy would accept for itself. The status \nof any Fijian in national life depended on his or her \nracial origin, whether that man or woman came from \none of the chiefly or business elites, and even what part \nof the country the person lived in.\n\nWe needed a revolution to put us on the path to \ntrue democracy. And from the time that that revolution \nbegan in 2006 to our election 10 days ago, we embarked \non a series of reforms that have transformed our nation. \nMore laws were passed during this eight-year period to \nimprove our standard of governance than in the entire \n36-year period since independence. And central to that \nwas the development of our supreme law \u2014 the 2013 \nConstitution \u2014 from which all other laws flow. It is the \nblueprint for the new Fiji. Now every Fiji Islander enjoys \nequal opportunity and a common identity \u2014 Fijian. That \nname was once reserved for the indigenous majority but \nnow applies to everyone from the Republic of Fiji, just \nas the common name American applies to all from the \nUnited States or the name Australian to any Australian \nfrom Australia.\n\nA range of social and economic rights have also \nbeen enshrined in our supreme law for the first time, \nrights that comply with a number of United Nations \nconventions \u2014 the right to economic participation, \na just minimum wage, education, housing, health \nand adequate food and water. The right to live in an \nenvironment free of pollution is a principle we hope \nthat every nation will embrace, as we strive for the \npreservation and protection of our natural surroundings. \nSo today, I am proud to report to the Assembly that Fiji \nis a fairer, more just society and a more compassionate \nsociety, as we step up our efforts to alleviate poverty on \nthe back of a rapidly strengthening economy.\n\nWe have also set our sights on being a smarter \ncountry by introducing free schooling at the primary \nand secondary levels for the first time. Plus we now \nhave an array of scholarships and a tertiary loans \nscheme to enable our young people to go on to higher \neducation. Our vision is to cement our place as a \npre-eminent Pacific Island nation, a true regional hub \nand a Pacific beacon of prosperity and progress for our \nsmaller neighbours. We intend to play a bigger role in \nthe wider world to voice our collective concerns about \nsuch issues as the environment, climate change and the \nneed to create a fairer trading system to benefit our \npeople in the Pacific and in all developing countries.\n\nAs we begin this new era in our national life, I want \nto thank those in the greater community of nations \nwho have stood by us in recent years as we made the \nreforms that were necessary to create a better Fiji. Not \neveryone understood what we were trying to do. Some \ntried to damage us with sanctions and to degrade our \nquality of governance because we refused to accept \ntheir prescriptive and high-handed approach towards \nus. But the majority of nations recognized our right \nto determine our own future and came to understand \nthat we were working not for the benefit of a governing \nelite but for the common good. To those in the General \nAssembly who gave us their support, our friends, 1 \nextend the grateful thanks of the Fijian people.\n\nI also want to especially thank those countries \nthat made up the Multinational Observer Group that \ndeclared our general election credible, free and fair. \nFor the co-leaders from Australia, India, Indonesia, \nCanada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, the members \nof the Melanesian Spearhead Group, New Zealand, the \nRepublic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the \nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America \u2014 I \noffer many thanks to them all. It has been a long and \nsometimes traumatic journey for our nation in the \n44 years since independence: four coups, a rebellion, \nfour Constitutions and 56 days of shame in 2000 when \nmembers of our Parliament were held hostage.\n\nFiji has struggled to be unified and cohesive; our \ndevelopment was retarded by our inability to think and \nwork as one nation, one people. But with the recent \nelection, we have put that era firmly behind us. In \nour new democracy, we are all Fijians, not members \nof separate ethnic and religious groups. And having \nestablished a common and equal citizenry, along with \na secular State, we intend to move forward together \nto finally fulfil our promise as a nation, to fulfil our \ndestiny.\n\nI especially want to pay tribute today to the Fijian \npeople. I say to them today before the world: this was \ntheir victory. Whichever candidate they chose, theirs \nwas a vote for a better future for our nation. I pledge \nagain that I will govern for the benefit of all our citizens, \nno matter who they are, where they come from or who \nthey voted for. Mine will be an inclusive Government \nover the next four years. I will be the leader of all Fijians, \nfor all Fijians. As we move our beloved nation forward, \nI am determined to leave no one behind. In that spirit, I \nextend a hand of friendship to my political opponents. \nWhatever our differences, let us now work together \nconstructively in our new Parliament, when it convenes \non 6 October, to improve the lives of every Fijian. \nWe are currently enjoying the most sustained period \nof economic growth in our history. The possibility to \ncreate more jobs and raise the living standards of our \npeople has never been greater. Let us join hands to put \nour nation first, to put Fiji first.\n\nI want to assure our Pacific neighbours of Fiji\u2019s \ncontinuing contribution to the region as we work \ntogether and collaborate to resolve the great challenges \nfacing us, develop our economies and improve the lives \nof all Pacific islanders. Fiji has played a leading role \nin the formation of the Pacific Islands Development \nForum, an addition to the existing regional framework, \nwhich, for the first time, links Governments with civil \nsociety groups and the private sector in a joint effort \nto solve our development problems in a sustainable \nmanner.\n\nFiji is privileged to have been given the \nresponsibility of hosting the Pacific Island Development \nForum Secretariat in our capital, Suva. We were equally \nprivileged that the outgoing Indonesian President, \nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyno, was our principal guest at \nthis year\u2019s Forum in June.\n\nIn this International Year of Small Island \nDeveloping States, we need a more concerted effort to \nstrengthen our regional institutions in order to confront \nthe enormous challenges we face in the Pacific, namely, \npopulation growth, the unsustainable use of our ocean\u2019s \nnatural resources and rising sea levels caused by climate \nchange. Climate change threatens to engulf some of our \nPacific Island States altogether, and is already forcing \nthe evacuation of coastal villages in Fiji.\n\nI repeat here what I have said in other forums: \nhistory will judge the world\u2019s major carbon-emitters \nextremely harshly, unless they take immediate and \ncomprehensive steps to reduce emissions. It is simply \nnot acceptable, purely in moral terms, for the world to \nallow the small island developing States to sink slowly \nbeneath the waves because of the selfish determination \nof industrialized nations to protect their own economies. \nTime is fast running out, and I beg Governments to act.\n\nI am also here to rededicate ourselves as a nation \nto the ideals of the United Nations and to its service, \nwhenever and wherever it is required. That service is at \nthe core of our foreign policy, whose central purpose is \nto be friends to all and enemies to none. It has been our \nprivilege to chair the largest voting bloc at the United \nNations, the Group of 77 and China, and this year to \nassume the Presidency of the Executive Board of the \nUnited Nations Development Programme.\n\nFor some 36 years now, Fiji has proudly contributed \nour troops to successive peacekeeping operations in \nLebanon, Sinai, Iraq, Syria, Timor-Leste, South Sudan, \nDarfur, Liberia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Namibia, \nCambodia and the Solomon Islands. Some of those \npeacekeepers have paid with their lives \u2014 as have \ntroops from other countries \u2014 and we honour those \nwho have fallen in the cause of peace. Last month, 45 of \nour soldiers currently serving with the United Nations \nDisengagement Observer Force, were held captive. \nAs a nation, we held grave fears for their safety, but \n\n\nafter two anxious weeks our prayers were answered, \nand our men were freed. I want to thank the skilful \nteam of United Nations negotiators who worked with \nour military officers and diplomats in a tireless effort \nto secure the release of our men. I also warmly thank \nthose nations that came to Fiji\u2019s assistance during that \ntrying period. We will never forget the role played by \nthose Governments in keeping our men safe so that they \ncan continue to fulfil their United Nations mandate and \neventually return safely to their families and friends in \nFiji.\n\nI am proud to say that not once during the course of \nthat crisis were there any calls in Fiji for the withdrawal \nof our troops from that, or future, peacekeeping \nmissions. Peacekeeping is a noble cause and is our \ncontribution to the welfare of ordinary men and women \nliving in less fortunate circumstances far from our \nisland home. I want everyone to know that Fiji will \nalways be ready to serve.\n\nTo strengthen our commitment to meeting our \ninternational obligations, this year Fiji opened a \nPermanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, \nwhich is focused on strengthening our interaction \nwith treaty bodies, such as the Human Rights Council, \nthe International Labour Organization, the World \nTrade Organization, the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization, the International Telecommunication \nUnion and other organizations based in Geneva.\n\nIn closing, Fiji looks forward to contributing \npositively to the work of the United Nations during the \nPresident\u2019s stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. On behalf of all Fijians, I pledge our full \nsupport and cooperation as the President carries out his \ntasks in the cause of the great global family to which \nwe all belong.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate my brother Sam \nKutesa of the Republic of Uganda on his well-deserved \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-ninth session. While wishing him every success \nin the discharge of his duties and responsibilities, \nmy delegation and I promise him our full support \n\n\nand cooperation. Allow me also to pay tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, \nfor his remarkable leadership of the Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session.\n\nOur illustrious Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \ndeserves praise and appreciation for his leadership \nand the good work he is doing for our esteemed \nOrganization. He has been performing his duty with \ncourage, dedication, passion and commitment in \ndriving the United Nations agenda. We will always be \ngrateful to him.\n\nWe welcome and fully endorse the theme of this \nyear\u2019s debate, \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d. \nWe expect the discussion on it to make important \ncontributions in the intergovernmental negotiations \nabout to start on the post-2015 development goals. As \nwe dedicate our time and effort to the negotiations on \nthe post-2015 development agenda, we must not lose \nsight of the unfinished business of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It is important that \nany unaccomplished targets and indicators should be \nproperly factored into the new agenda. In the meantime, \nwe should ensure that we use the remaining 461 days to \naccelerate the pace of implementing the MDGs.\n\nThe issue of financing the implementation of \nthe post-2015 development agenda must be given \nspecial attention. I am mentioning this matter because \nexperience has taught us that, other factors aside, we \nwill fall short of attaining a number of the MDG targets \nand indicators because of unpredictable, unreliable, \ninsufficient and untimely availability of financial \nresources. Therefore, for the post-2015 development \nagenda to be achieved, we must devise a mechanism \nto ensure stable, predictable and reliable sources of \nfinance for their implementation.\n\nThere is more to the year 2015 than the deadline for \nthe MDGs and the onset of the post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment goals. The year 2015 is also a deadline \nfor the world to conclude a legally binding climate \nchange agreement. We thank the Secretary-General \nfor convening the Climate Summit that took place on \n23 September, here at the United Nations. It afforded \nus a unique opportunity to put our minds together and \ndeliberate on ways to save this planet from disaster and \nadvance on clean development pathways. It was very \nopportune, indeed, to hold the Summit two months \nbefore the twentieth Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (COP-20), which is due to be held in Lima in \nDecember 2014, and one year before COP-21, to be held \nin Paris next year. In many ways, the Summit may help \nto make the work in Peru less difficult. As members \nknow, a successful Lima Conference will mean a lot \nin terms of the Paris Conference, where we expect \nto conclude a legally binding climate agreement. We \nknow it is not easy, but Tanzania and Africa as a whole \nare appealing to all countries from all continents to do \nwhatever it takes to ensure that COP-21 delivers on the \nexpectations all of us have. Failure should not be an \noption.\n\nUnited Nations reforms are long overdue. Reports \nthat consultations and negotiations are not showing \nencouraging signs of progress are very frustrating \nindeed. We should remain steadfast and vigilant and not \nallow the momentum to be lost. We humbly request the \nPresident of the Assembly to use his good offices and \nlong-standing diplomatic skills to revitalize the process \nand keep it on track. We must keep the flame burning.\n\nGlobal peace and security are in a state of flux. \nThe events occurring in North Africa, the Middle \nEast, Eastern Europe, the Great Lakes region and the \nHorn of Africa are matters of concern to all of us. \nEqually important is the menace of terrorism; the illicit \nexploitation of natural resources; poaching; and the \nillicit trade in narcotic drugs and weapons, which are \nmaking the world less secure.\n\nTerrorism is assuming new dimensions, making \nit a huge threat today because of its indiscriminate, \nlethal and callous character. Hundreds of innocent \npeople have lost their lives or been abducted, with \nfatal consequences. No country is insulated from this \nmenace, and nobody is safe. As such, it calls for all of \nus to play an active role in the fight against terrorism \nand cross-border crime. Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, the \nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other terrorist \norganizations should not be allowed to have their way. \nLibya should not be left to disintegrate. The senseless \nfighting in the Central African Republic and South \nSudan must be brought to an end. This world, under \nthe leadership of the Security Council and regional \norganizations, has the capacity to do exactly that. Let \nus do what is required of us to stop the bloodshed, loss \nof life, suffering of innocent people and destruction of \nproperty.\n\nThe horrifying scenes of bombings and the \ndeaths of innocent women, children and men in the \nrecent hostilities between Israel and Palestine are \n\n\nheartbreaking. Unfortunately, the conflict has been \ngoing on for far too long, despite the fact that the \nlasting solution is known: two States, living side by \nside harmoniously. That solution has been elusive. The \ntime has now come for the United Nations, the United \nStates of America, Russia, Europe and other global and \nregional Powers to come together in concerted efforts \nto make it happen. We should not wait any longer.\n\nAs regards the question of Western Sahara, let me \nreiterate the appeal I made last year to the Security \nCouncil to do everything in its power to resolve that \nproblem once and for all. Honestly, I cannot comprehend \nwhy that problem, which began around the same time as \nthat in East Timor, nearly 40 years ago, should remain \nunresolved to this day. What are the insurmountable \nchallenges impeding the United Nations from ending \nthe impasse? I ask the United Nations to please do what \nis needed and put the Sahrawi question to rest. I know \nit can.\n\nOnce again, we in Tanzania wish to join others who \nspoke before us in calling for an end to the sanctions \nand embargo against Cuba and its people. For over 50 \nyears, the embargo has condemned the people of Cuba, \nincluding innocent children and women, to perpetual \nhardship and poverty. It is high time that the embargo \nbe lifted and the people of Cuba given the opportunity \nto live in dignity like everybody else on this planet.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held \nat a time when our brothers and sisters in Liberia, Sierra \nLeone and Guinea are confronting the worst outbreak \nof the deadly Ebola epidemic to date. In those three \ncountries, together with Nigeria and the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, some 2,400 people have lost \ntheir lives. The disease, which has no cure or vaccine \nas yet, presents a major threat to the countries where \nthe disease is known to exist, but also to neighbouring \ncountries and beyond. Unless the world succeeds in \ncontrolling the spread of this disease, there is every \nlikelihood that it will become a global epidemic.\n\nOur collective efforts in that regard are the best \nway forward. I believe the world has the technology, \nknowledge and financial resources that, if put together, \ncan defeat the threat posed by Ebola. We should also \ncontinue to support the efforts of the world\u2019s scientists, \nwho are working tirelessly, day and night, in search \nof a cure and a vaccine. We applaud the efforts being \nundertaken by the United Nations, the World Health \nOrganization, the United States Government and other \ncountries with the necessary technical and technological \ncapabilities to assist the affected countries and wage \nthe fight against the disease worldwide\n\nWe request four things. First, we must continue and, \nwhere possible, bolster that support until the spread of \nthe disease is under control. Secondly, we must continue \nto assist other nations in West Africa and elsewhere on \nthe African continent in building their capacities for \nsurveillance, isolation and treatment. Thirdly, we must \nintensify our efforts to develop a cure and a vaccine \nto save the lives of those infected now and to prevent \nothers from being infected. Fourthly and finally, we \nmust help Africa; we must help African nations so that \nthe stigma that is developing against Africa because of \nEbola is stopped.\n\nReports that a number of people from other \ncontinents are now shying away from coming to Africa \nand are cancelling travel plans because of Ebola are \ndisturbing. That is threatening to kill the all-important \ntourism industry, trade and investment flows to Africa. \nMay the United Nations and friends of Africa please \nhelp us to tell the world that Africa is a continent of \n54 countries, not a country of 54 provinces. Not all \ncountries in Africa have the disease. Moreover, many \ncountries are far away from the concerned countries in \nWest Africa. In fact, the affected countries are closer \nto Europe than they are to Kenya, Tanzania or South \nAfrica in eastern and southern Africa, to mention but a \nfew. As a matter of fact, they are 9 to 11 hours away by \nair from those countries. To cancel travel to our parts \nof Africa is incomprehensible and a gross injustice to \nthe continent.\n\nI am confident that this seven-day debate on \nthe theme \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d affords \nus another opportunity to define a bright future for \nourselves, our children, our children\u2019s children and their \ngrandchildren. We should seize the moment to build on \nthe success stories and lessons from the many countries \nand peoples who have been successful. We should \nalso learn from the challenges and failures during the \nimplementation of the MDGs in conceiving the goals, \ntargets and indicators of the post-2015 development \nagenda. Tanzania stands ready to cooperate with the \nrest of the Members of the United Nations family in \nbuilding consensus on the post-2015 development goals.\n\nAllow me to conclude by appealing to everyone in \nthis Hall to promise to work for a post-2015 development \nagenda that will make the world a better place for all of \nus to live in.\n\n"

We are \nfully confident that during his tenure he will advocate \nfor and advance the most pressing issues of our peoples. \nHe can count on Nicaragua\u2019s support.\n\nWe would also like to congratulate the President \nof the General Assembly at the previous session, a \nbrother from the Community of Latin American and \nCaribbean States, Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua \nand Barbuda, and his entire team for their dedicated \nleadership and unstinting effort to realize an agenda for \nthe benefit of our peoples.\n\nWe live in a world of many interconnected and \nrelated crises that reveal the unjust and inequitable \ndevelopment policies prevailing among various peoples \nand nations. The existing unjust economic order, \nresulting from imperialism and its contemporary \nmodel \u2014 global capitalism \u2014 has failed to respond \nto the growing and increasingly frequent crises. The \nnumbers of the world\u2019s poor increase daily in both the \nSouth and the North, in flagrant violation of the most \nbasic human rights. We must work together to overcome \nand eradicate poverty, hunger, malnutrition, disease, \nwar and conflict, regime change politics and coups, \nviolence against women and children, the arms race, \nthe negative impacts of climate change, and emerging \nsocial and slavery plagues, including drug trafficking, \n\n\norganized crime and human trafficking, among others, \nas soon as possible.\n\nSocial justice, solidarity, unity, complementarity \namong peoples, and brotherhood and respect among \nnations must prevail. The eradication of poverty \nremains the greatest challenge facing the world. \nWe will begin negotiations on the post-2015 agenda \nwith the central concern of not having achieved \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in all \ndeveloping countries. It is urgent to redouble efforts \nand create an international environment conducive to \nfacilitating developing countries\u2019 implementation of \nthe MDGs, including appropriate financing.\n\nThe post-2015 agenda will provide a new \nopportunity to strive for a just world order. It should \npromote sustained economic growth, inclusive and \nparticipatory social development, environmental \nprotection and human dignity, with sufficient flexibility \nto respond to the needs, priorities and specificities \nof each country and region, conscious of the fact that \nno single model or recipe for development exists. The \nagenda should involve an intergovernmental, open and \ntransparent process, based on the results of the Open \nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals \nand the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment.\n\nDeveloping countries suffer the most from the \nadverse effects of climate change, whose extreme \nmeteorological phenomena are ever more frequent and \nintense. Despite our economic limitations and prioritized \nfocus on poverty and sustainable development and with \nno obligation under the Convention, we are assuming \nthe costs of the adaptation and mitigation efforts.\n\nWe must urgently achieve a binding agreement \nin 2015, containing strong, ambitious and balanced \ncommitments on all its provisions and based on the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and its principles and provisions, particularly \nequity and common but differentiated responsibilities, \nin order to address the climate crisis and protect the \necosystems that sustain life on our Mother Earth.\n\nNo country that is part of the international \ncommunity can claim the right to use or threaten the use \nof force in its international relations. Such exceptionalist \npolicies not only do not resolve conflicts; rather, they \nstir things up, as has been seen in recent years. Dialogue \nand negotiation are the only means to resolve conflict. \nBased on its Charter, the United Nations must assume \nits role as the main organ responsible for ensuring \nworld peace and must reject war-mongering policies, \nwar and confrontation. Given the challenges we are \ndealing with, thorough reform of the United Nations \nis becoming increasingly imperative, and particularly \nreform of the Security Council, which should recognize \ncontemporary realities by including the voices and \nvotes of developing countries in the categories of both \npermanent and non-permanent members.\n\nWe consider it vital that we have a nuclear-\nweapon-free world with total and complete disarmament. \nWe welcome the designation last year of 26 September \nas the International Day for the Total Elimination \nof Nuclear Weapons, initiated by the Non-Aligned \nMovement at Cuba\u2019s suggestion.\n\nIn the face of the growing Ebola epidemic, Cuba, \nour sister in solidarity, has once again made its human \nand scientific resources available to work alongside \nour African brothers who are fighting the deadly \nvirus. Meanwhile, that same sister nation of Cuba \ncontinues to resist the criminal economic and financial \nembargo imposed on it by the United States. Nicaragua \nemphasizes its unconditional solidarity with Cuba and \ndemands an end to a blockade that violates international \nlaw and the human rights of the people of Cuba. We \ndemand the immediate and unconditional release of \nthe five anti-terrorist Cuban patriots. And we condemn \nthe role that the United States arrogates to itself in \nputting countries on its unilateral and arbitrary list of \nState sponsors of international terrorism, and demand \nthat Cuba be removed from the list. We condemn such \nanachronistic United States policies, as well as the \nintensification of the blockade and its extra-territorial \nnature.\n\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its \nBolivarian revolution continue to suffer from harassment, \ninterference and external aggression. Nicaragua offers \nits unconditional support to Venezuela\u2019s people and \nGovernment, led by our comrade Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \nMoros, in their defence of their revolutionary liberation \nprocess.\n\nWe must bring to an immediate end Israel\u2019s illegal \noccupation of Palestinian territory and prevent Israel \nfrom continuing its aggression and brutal attacks \non the men, women and children of Palestine. The \nSecurity Council should once and for all live up to its \nobligations and demand that Israel end such practices \nand policies in order to clear the way for a sovereign \nand independent State of Palestine, based on its \n\n\npre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \nand with two States, Palestine and Israel, living side \nby side in peace. Nicaragua reiterates its absolute and \nunconditional solidarity with the State of Palestine in \nits fight for freedom and its inalienable rights.\n\nWe also stress our total solidarity with the \nGovernment and the people of Syria in their fight \nagainst international terrorism and in defence of their \nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We emphasize the \nimportance of achieving a negotiated political solution \namong Syrians and ending foreign intervention, \nincluding the financing and supplying of weapons to \nterrorist groups. When confronted by such conflicts, \nrather than opting for dialogue and negotiation to \nsettle them, the NATO countries take unilateral \ndecisions, measures and action outside the United \nNations framework and in violation of international \nlaw, including aerial bombardment in territories of \nsovereign countries.\n\nNicaragua has frequently expressed its rejection \nand condemnation of actions aimed at regime change, \nwhich rupture constitutional order, lead to widespread \nviolence, encourage the use of force and open the door to \ncoups d\u2019\u00e9tat that can overthrow legitimate Governments \nelected by the will of the people. That is the kind of \npolicy that we have witnessed in Ukraine; it has led \nto loss of life and the displacement of populations, \nand created a humanitarian crisis with unpredictable \nconsequences. Because we want peace and believe in \nthe prevention and resolution of conflicts by peaceful \nand inclusive means, we reject such policies, as well \nas the imposition of unilateral measures and economic \nsanctions that violate international law.\n\nNicaragua recognizes the cooperation of China on \nTaiwan with developing countries, particularly in the \narea of food and social inclusion programmes, and we \nreiterate our support for the legitimate aspirations of \nChina on Taiwan for greater participation in the United \nNations specialized agencies, one that accords with the \nrequirements and needs of its population of 23 million.\n\nWe reiterate our full support for the legitimate \nrights of the Republic of Argentina in the dispute \nover the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands, the \nSouth Sandwich Islands and the adjacent islands. The \nUnited Kingdom should comply immediately with the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions and initiate direct \nnegotiations with Argentina. Similarly, we support and \nconsider ourselves part of Argentina\u2019s fight against \nvulture funds.\n\nPuerto Rico continues to labour under the colonial \nyoke and now more than ever needs our solidarity and \nactive support in its struggle for independence and \nself-determination. The United States should free the \nworld\u2019s longest-imprisoned political captive, the Puerto \nRican patriot Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera. We also commend \nand remain in solidarity with the struggle of the people \nof Western Sahara under the leadership of the Frente \nPolisario.\n\nNicaragua, a small country whose policies are \nbased on Christian values, socialist principles and the \npractice of solidarity, works proactively in our complex \nglobal environment, through various international and \nregional forums, to promote policies of peace, unity and \nunderstanding among nations, political and negotiated \nsolutions to conflicts and the right of our peoples to \nachieve sustainable development and well-being.\n\nThe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \nAmerica, of which Nicaragua is a member, has been \na factor in improving unity, complementarity and \neconomic integration in our region. In turn, it promotes \nother forums such as Petrocaribe, which groups together \n20 countries of our region and has had an immediate \nand concrete positive impact on the well-being of our \npeoples as one way of overcoming poverty, hunger and \ninequality. On 14 December, we will celebrate the tenth \nanniversary of its founding, resulting from the unifying \nvision of the Latin American and Caribbean leaders \nHugo Ch\u00e1vez Frias and Fidel Castro Ruz.\n\nThese steps towards regional integration have \nborne fruit with the creation of the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States, through which we \ncontinue to deepen our process of political, economic, \nsocial and cultural integration, respecting diversity and \nbuilding unity. We have declared our region a zone of \npeace. Within the framework of the Central American \nIntegration System, we are strengthening integration in \nall fields and working together to fight the scourges of \ndrug trafficking and organized crime and to turn the \nGulf of Fonseca into a zone of peace and development.\n\nOur Government of Reconciliation and National \nUnity, under the visionary leadership of our President, \nCommander Daniel Ortega Saavedra, continues to work \nto restore the political, economic, social and cultural \nrights of all Nicaraguans. Nicaragua has become the \nleading country in the region in terms of public safety. \nOur fight against drug trafficking, organized crime \nand human trafficking has been recognized as the most \nvigorous and effective in the region. Our economic \n\n\n\ngrowth is consistent and rising and is among the highest \nof our region. We are reducing poverty and extreme \npoverty, attaining the Millennium Development Goals \nand empowering women through political and economic \nparticipation. Indeed, we rank very highly in the world \nin terms of female ministers, parliamentarians and \nmayors.\n\nWe combat violence against women and girls head \non, with strict laws and social programmes targeting \nboth groups, and with police stations for women in all \nmunicipalities of the country. Education and health care \nare prioritized and are provided free for all Nicaraguans, \nand early childhood care programmes and maternity \nhomes can be found throughout the country.\n\nIn our Caribbean autonomous regions, in addition \nto the restitution of the rights of indigenous peoples \nand people of African descent, the autonomy process \nis growing in strength every day, with the recent \ncompletion of the land ownership process in the \nindigenous and Afro-descendant communities. All \nthese efforts of our people and Government, together \nwith our policies of inclusion and social justice, won \nimmediate recognition and support from our people, \nwho have taken ownership of them, and they have been \nheld up as examples of good practice by all the agencies, \nprojects and programmes of the United Nations system.\n\nIn conclusion, we note that the work of the General \nAssembly at the present session and in the coming \nyears will be crucial for developing countries and the \nrest of the world. Let us unite from this very moment \nto achieve the urgent and necessary changes needed to \nattain a better world and better lives for our peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to \nwish you every success in your important duties.\n\nLet me begin with a quote by Edward Wilson:\n\n\u201cThe great challenge of the twenty-first century \nis to raise people everywhere to a decent standard \nof living, while preserving as much of the rest of \nlife as possible.\u201d\nTo preserve life and the sustainability of the planet \nfor every human is not pure theory. It is a practical \nquestion for our future and for that of our children. \nThe Millennium Development Goals, the post-2015 \nframework and the challenge of climate change must \nform much more than the theoretical basis for our \ndiscussions. Those goals must identify, address, offer \na solution to and solve problems that in one or two \ngenerations may bring the human race to the brink of \nits own existence.\nSeventy years ago, when the Second World War \ncaused tens of millions of deaths, consuming all of \nthe principles of humanity, the patriots and democrats \nin my country, Slovakia, took up arms and put their \nlives at risk to fight against evil and for liberty and \ndemocratic values. They fought together with many \nother nations to establish the foundation for new global \ncooperation, given shape a year later with the adoption \nof the Charter of the United Nations. The horrors of \nthe Second World War, the failure of the international \ncommunity to maintain world peace, the direct threat \non the part of larger countries to use force against \nsmaller ones and the absence of an international order \nand rules that are be universally accepted and respected \nwere a painful lesson for us all.\n\nCooperation among nations has come a long way in \nthe past seven decades. The United Nations has played \nan important role on that road, but we have not gathered \nhere to celebrate a false sense of success. We have to \ngo much further than simply to identify challenges. It \nwould be a lost opportunity if political correctness and \ndiplomatic language were to limit us from openly and \nfreely naming and discussing the problems that plague \nour world and the continents, countries and citizens that \nwe represent. We must not betray the commitments that \nwe all made to the principles of democracy, peace and \nsecurity for every single citizen of our planet. We must \nlook into the mirror to see what we are doing, how we do \nit, what we are doing or have done wrong and what we \ncan do better. We believed that the number of conflicts \nwould gradually decrease as our civilization matured \nand developed. However, today, we are confronted \nwith the opposite reality. Instability is increasingly \nbecoming the new status quo. Instability, poverty and \nhatred are the fertilizers and catalysts of terrorism, and \nterrorism is a threat to which no one is immune.\n\nA year ago, we Europeans could hardly imagine \nthat, after investing so much effort in achieving peace \nand stability in our continent, a new armed conflict \nwould arise in our neighbourhood. Conflict is dangerous \nboth in its nature and in its consequences. Twenty \nyears ago, Ukraine abandoned its nuclear programme \nin exchange for the security and territorial integrity \nguarantees granted by the United States, the United \n\n\nKingdom, China, France and the Russian Federation. \nToday, instead of marking a major anniversary of \nachievement in the area of security and stability on the \nEuropean continent, we are witnessing armed conflict \nand political instability. Instead of building a world \nwithout weapons of mass destruction, we encourage \nthose countries that seek security under the lethal \nnuclear umbrella.\n\nSlovakia strongly denounces violations of the \nterritorial integrity of any State. That is a trademark \nof our foreign policy. It is a pillar for the stability of \nthe geopolitical architecture. We support that principle, \nand Ukraine and the annexation of the Crimea are \nnot an exception. We are nevertheless convinced that \ndialogue and diplomatic efforts, with the participation \nof Russia, will lead to sustainable peace in Ukraine. \nWe must respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and \nthe sovereign right of its people to decide their fate in a \nfree and independent manner. The United Nations plays \na crucial role in that matter. What Ukraine needs today \nis to restore peace and stability, implement reforms \nand be reassured of the strength of the guarantees for \nthe inviolability of its territory. Slovakia is ready to \nparticipate in that process.\n\nDiplomatic language is full of allegories, but \neven the nicest language cannot hide the naked truth \nwhen people are being killed. Acts of barbarism and \ncruelty have become a freely available article. They are \nbroadcast live to our homes. They make us insensitive \nto violence far away. At the same time, they create the \nfeeling of having being born into an unsafe world, in \nwhich people ask: where is the effective protective \numbrella of the United Nations?\n\nA year ago, we could not imagine the sudden rise \nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), \nwhich has become a global threat in a short time. It has \novershadowed the long-term effort of the international \ncommunity in Iraq. The ideology and acts of ISIL \nrepresent an unprecedented level of brutality and the \ntwisted use of the media for their self-promotion. It \nrepresents the dangerous ideology of forcing violent \nchanges to State borders. It embodies ethnic and \nreligious cleansing, which will not stop at the borders \nof Iraq, Syria or the neighbouring countries, but has the \nambition to spread beyond the region of the Middle East. \nThe entire global community has the responsibility to \nact in order to end the suffering of the innocent victims \nof violence and to protect children and women. Today, \nwe must to stand united in Iraq and prevent ISIL from \ntaking root in the territory it has occupied and from \nconsolidating its military and economic power.\n\nAutocratic and totalitarian ideologies always bring \nsuffering, the restriction of rights, internal conflict, \ninjustice and death. We are all too familiar with \ntheir ultimate price and catastrophic consequences. \nAmong the many tasks facing the United Nations \nare the prevention of such ideologies from becoming \nsuccessful, the protection of human rights, the adoption \nof every possible preventive measures to prevent \nconflict and the establishment of sustainable peace.\n\nSlovakia, with its own first-hand experience of \ntransitioning from a totalitarian regime to democracy, \nsupports efforts to create the conditions necessary for \nsustainable peace. We promote security sector reform \nas one of the key factors for success in the peaceful \ndevelopment in regions emerging from conflict, as \nwell as for States going through a regime change to \ndemocracy. Stable security institutions such as the police \nand military can better fulfil their duties to safeguard \nhuman rights and protect their citizens, especially \nsociety\u2019s most vulnerable members, including women \nand girls.\n\nThe Slovak Republic actively fulfils its commitments \nto Afghanistan. The United Nations Assistance Mission \nin Afghanistan is led by a diplomat from Slovakia. We \nremain convinced that in the aftermath of the recent \npresidential election, the new Afghan leadership will \nbe able to create the conditions needed to achieve \nnational and social unity and to continue supporting \ninternational assistance. I am pleased to note that the \ntwo former presidential candidates have reached an \nagreement, and we believe that that will contribute to \nAfghanistan\u2019s stability. Slovakia is ready to continue \nto do its part in assisting the Afghan people in that \nendeavour.\n\nDisarmament is key to eliminating potential \nsources of tension and conflict. Last year\u2019s signing of \nthe Arms Trade Treaty was an important step towards \nestablishing common legal standards for regulating \nand monitoring international trade in conventional \nweapons. The Slovak Republic was among the first 50 \ncountries to ratify the Treaty, and we are hopeful that \nits implementation will contribute to eliminating the \ndangers of the illegal arms trade and thus strengthen \nglobal security.\n\nLast but not least, peace, security and stability \nare preconditions for development. The rule of law, \n\n\ndemocratic governance and human rights are essential \nfor every single citizen. But we must address, respond \nto and solve the global issues that may be as deadly \nfor humankind as a nuclear war \u2014 the changes that \nare occurring on our planet. Globalization has created \nborderless opportunities for entrepreneurship, but it has \nalso created new challenges that we must deal with if we \nare to make life on Earth sustainable \u2014 climate change, \ninequalities in development and in the distribution of \ngoods and services, poverty and unequal access to \nhealth and education.\n\nSlovakia is and will remain a responsible member of \nthe global community. We participate in the discussion \non financing sustainable development, offering our own \nexperience of economic transition. Global challenges \nrequire global action and national responsibility. We \nare ready to do our share.\n\nThe peoples of the world have vested in the United \nNations an exclusive and global responsibility: to \nrespond to violations of peace, ensusre respect for \ninternational law, protect human rights and deal with \nthreats to humanity. Let us all make sure that it is able \nto continue to carry out those responsibilities. For \ndecades, the Organization has been the forum where we \ncan name those responsible for the murder of their own \ncitizens on a massive scale, the leaders who worship a \ncult of hatred and intolerance, and those who favour \narms over agreements and international law. But in the \ncases where we have failed, our failure has caused the \nsuffering and death of innocent people.\n\nWe, the United Nations, should not give up on \nthe ideal of being the conscience of the world. Our \nOrganization should be the authority with the ability \nto define, prevent and solve conflicts and problems. \nTogether we must convince people around the world \nthat we are safeguarding the international norms and \nprinciples that the United Nations is built on. If we fail \nto accomplish that within the United Nations itself, \nwe will not be able to guarantee to humankind that \ntotalitarianism, injustice, impunity and amorality will \nnot prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, on \nbehalf of the Government of Papua New Guinea, to \ncongratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \nPapua New Guinea supports his leadership as we work \nwith him on the ambitious theme of \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Ambassador John Ashe for his strong leadership \nin setting the stage for enhancing the sustainable \ndevelopment agenda of Member States, especially \nof small island developing States (SIDS). We also \ncommend the Secretary-General for his leadership and \nuntiring commitment to advancing the cause of global \npeace and security to enhance the multidimensional \nglobal development agenda.\n\nIt has been a long and sometimes hard road for the \npeople of Fiji over the past eight years. We therefore \nwarmly congratulate the people of Fiji for their return \nto constitutional and democratic rule following their \ngeneral elections this year. We welcome the return of \nFiji to the Commonwealth and to the Pacific Islands \nForum. In wishing the people of Fiji well, Papua New \nGuinea will continue to stand ready to assist them, as \nit has done in the past, along with other major Pacific \npartners, in areas where such assistance can be effective \nas Fiji embarks on its new path forward.\n\nThe recent third International Conference on Small \nIsland Developing States, held in Samoa, was a great \nsuccess. We commend the adoption of the Small Island \nDeveloping States Accelerated Modalities of Action/\nSamoa Pathway, which reiterated the sustainable \ndevelopment priorities of SIDS, which has been \naffirmed by the international community.\n\nBut the impacts of climate change continue to pose \na serious challenge to the sustainable development \nof SIDS. The full range of damaging events \u2014 such \nas rising sea levels, coastal erosion, salinization of \nthe fresh water table, prolonged and severe droughts, \nflooding and other extreme weather and loss of and \ndamage to vital infrastructure \u2014 remains a constant \nconcern for SIDS. Many SIDS, especially in the Pacific, \nhave reached a tipping point. While the right thing for \nus to do is to respond to the challenges by working \nsmarter and harder to improve the livelihoods of people \nat risk, the bigger and advanced countries of the world \nmust not only do likewise; they must also redouble their \nefforts in partnering with us.\n\nAs part of our support to Pacific SIDS, Papua \nNew Guinea has launched the Pacific Development \nAssistance Programme, which is aimed at assisting \nPacific SIDS in critical areas of development such as \neducation, health, capacity-building, climate change \nand the reconstruction of important infrastructure \nafter natural disasters. We reiterate our call on the \ninternational community, including the United Nations, \nto work together with SIDS in the spirit of genuine and \ndurable partnership.\n\nWe commend the Secretary-General for convening \nthe successful Climate Summit last week. In \nsupporting the outcomes, we must build on the political \nmomentum generated as we move towards Lima this \nyear and, importantly, towards Paris in 2015, where \nthe international community must conclude a legally \nbinding agreement in order for us to collectively \naddress the adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nThe international community stands at an \nimportant crossroads. The imminent deadline of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \ntransition to the post-2015 development agenda have \nrightly become the centre stage of the global agenda. \nWe support a people-centered and transformative \npost-2015 development agenda underpinned by global \npartnerships that support national ownership of \nsustainable development.\n\nWe welcome the adoption by the General Assembly, \nby resolution 68/309, of the report of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals (A/68/970), \n\nwhich recommended 17 goals. We must chart a realistic \npath, with goals that are attainable given the necessary \nmeans of implementation. We also commend the work \nof the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \nSustainable Development Financing, which is critical \nto the successful implementation of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nIn that respect, the Pacific island developing States \nnote with appreciation the inclusion of the important \nproposed stand-alone goals on oceans and seas, \nsustainable energy and climate change. Along with \nthe other proposed goals, those goals should form the \nbasis for the intergovernmental negotiations that are to \ntake place. Papua New Guinea will participate in those \nnegotiations.\n\nMy Government remains fully committed to those \nefforts because we have experienced the galvanizing \nimpact of the MDGs, which has helped us take national \nownership and develop a home-grown sustainable \ndevelopment paradigm. While my country\u2019s MDG \nscorecard remains a work in progress, my Government \nhas undertaken various initiatives to redress the \nsituation. We have retailored the MDGs to our national \npriorities, with 88 indicators connecting them to our \nnational development plans.\n\nA recent report by the United Nations country \noffice on progress to achieve the MDGs was optimistic \nand positive. The report found that Papua New Guinea \nhad made important strides towards achieving the \nMDGs, especially since the general elections in 2012. \nThey include the bold decision to run budget deficits \nuntil 2017, which, the report notes, has enabled the \nnation to invest in essential areas.\n\nMy Government is implementing a policy of free \neducation for all primary-school children, resulting \nin an increase in school enrolments by as much as \n80 per cent in some areas. We now have around \n2 million children in schools. In the health sector, \nwe are witnessing a reduction of rates in early child \nand maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other \ncommunicable diseases. More mothers and children \nare getting access to health care as a result of our free \nhealth-care policy. Our infrastructure development \nprogramme is improving Papua New Guinea\u2019s business \nenvironment and creating opportunities for our people \nto participate meaningfully in national development.\n\nA key cornerstone of our development road map \nis a people-centred focus on population management \nand stabilization. It entails empowering individuals to \ntake leadership and full responsibility to improve their \nlivelihoods through appropriate measures. Our economy \nhas grown over the last decade at an average rate of 6 to \n8 per cent per annum, and is projected to reach 20 per \ncent in 2015. That growth is transforming our country, \nespecially with revenue from the completion of our first \nliquefied natural gas project and its exports.\n\nThis is a new economic and development age for \nour economy. The unprecedented and transformative \neconomic progress will coincide with the pursuit of \nthe post-2015 development agenda. We are clearly \nfocused on actively participating in the process and in \nits implementation at the national and regional levels. \nOur Government is fully committed to ensuring that we \nmanage the transformation carefully and effectively. \nOur challenge is to ensure that the growth delivers the \nmaximum benefit to our citizens.\n\nRecently, our Government launched a $100 million \ninitiative with our leading national bank, the Bank of \nthe South Pacific, to make home loans more affordable \nfor our citizens. We are also facilitating financial \ninclusion services for our people. We are grateful to our \ndevelopment partners, including the United Nations, \nAustralia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China \nand the European Union. My Government has helped \nwith the capital for the first national women\u2019s bank and \nfor microcredit schemes to help our people at the grass-\nroots level become owners and drivers of their future \nwell-being. In addition, we are giving priority to small \nand medium enterprises to drive national development.\n\nFurthermore, my Government is developing a \nnational statistics development strategy to provide a road \nmap for Papua New Guinea to continually improve and \nupdate the collection and management of its statistical \ninformation in order to improve decision-making. \nThat includes embarking on a national biometric \nidentification card system to record and maintain the \npopulation information of our citizens.\n\nDespite our economic growth, social issues remain \na challenge. My Government values our women and \ngirls, who constitute half of our population, as equal \ndevelopment partners. We are making sure that gender \nempowerment and equality continue to be a cornerstone \nof our responsible sustainable development. We \ntherefore support the work of UN-Women.\n\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that my \nGovernment has committed record funding of \n\n$10 million this year for various initiatives, including \npartnering with the United Nations Population Fund \nto make available 40,000 contraceptive implants as \nimportant intervention measures for the health of our \nwomen and girls of child-bearing age. That will be \nscaled up to $20 million by 2015. My Government, \nin partnership with our development partners, is also \ninvesting in upgrading vital midwifery skills, along \nwith enhancing our health referral systems to address \ncomplicated pregnancies. As a member of the Executive \nBoard of UNICEF, we will promote and participate in \nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the \nRights of the Child.\n\nMy Government welcomes and pledges our support \nfor the President\u2019s timely agenda for strengthening \ninternational peace and security. As a responsible \nMember of the United Nations, we are committed \nto fostering global peace and security. As such, my \ncountry is deploying a modest level of troops to the \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in the Sudan \nand South Sudan. As our capacity grows, we intend to \ncontribute more.\n\nWe are concerned about the increasing conflicts \nand tensions in many parts of the world, particularly \nthose involving non-State actors. An unacceptable \nheavy toll of destruction is exacted upon millions of \ninnocent children, women and men, often uprooted \nfrom their homes, dislocated and downtrodden and \ntheir dignity humiliated. We must rebuke and unite \nagainst the rising tide of intolerance, bigotry and hatred \nunder various banners.\n\nWe again condemn terrorism in all its \nmanifestations. We join the international community \nto combat that global threat. Our support for Security \nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014) against terrorism, which \nwas recently adopted, is a reaffirmation that inhuman \natrocities committed cannot and should not be condoned \nby the international community. Those responsible for \nsuch inhuman atrocities must be held accountable.\n\nWe are also concerned by the rising tensions \nbetween and within certain countries and the \nre-emergence of the ugly head of another potential \narms race. The world does not need that; rather, we \nmust recommit our efforts for global disarmament that \nsupports a transformative development agenda that \nbrings long-lasting improvement in the livelihoods of \npeople everywhere.\n\nThe Ebola crisis is a concern that is not limited just \nto West Africa. It is an international crisis, one which \nwe, the international community, must address together \nas we have done with severe acute respiratory syndrome \nand HIV/AIDS. Those diseases and pandemics do \nnot recognize national sovereign borders. Like other \ncountries, Papua New Guinea has taken appropriate \nmeasures to address the potential spread of Ebola.\n\nWe note with concern that progress in the Third \nInternational Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism \nhas been slow. We need to strengthen efforts to \ncomplete that process. Papua New Guinea urges the \nimplementation of the report and conclusions of the \nUnited Nations visiting mission to New Caledonia this \nyear, and thereby calls on the United Nations and the \ninternational community, particularly the administering \nPower, to support the process of decolonization under \nthe Noumea Accord. The Summit of the Melanesian \nSpearhead Group in June 2013 supported through \na declaration the efforts of the Front de lib\u00e9ration \nnationale kanak et socialiste in New Caledonia.\n\n\nPapua New Guinea strongly believes that the \ninternational community is a better, more secure and \nharmonious place because of the United Nations. \nCertainly there are areas in the United Nations where \nreform is required, as is the case with any large \norganization. We need to recommit ourselves to the \nareas where the Organization has been successful, and \nin other areas we need to build adequate systems. Our \nultimate objective must be to promote a more effective, \nmore accountable, more responsive and more caring \nUnited Nations \u2014 a United Nations capable of meeting \nthe challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nPapua New Guinea therefore shares the President\u2019s \nintention to further reform, rejuvenate and strengthen \nthe Security Council to allow for equitable geographic \nrepresentation. Regrettably, that important organ does \nnot reflect today\u2019s geopolitical realities. We again join \nmany other Member States in calling for the reform of \nthe Security Council in both categories of membership.\n\nAt this time next year we will be celebrating \n40 years of nation-building in Papua New Guinea, just \nas the United Natons commemorates its seventieth \nanniversary. We continue to be a proud, united country \nof many diverse cultures and peoples speaking more \nthan 800 languages. We are also rapidly transforming \n\nour traditional way of life to that of a modern country \nin just one generation.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommit my country to the ideals \nof the Charter of the United Nations and pledge to work \nclosely with all other Member States to collaborate on \nsolutions to the many issues we all face as humankind.\n"

Our Prime \nMinister, the Right Honourable John Key, is engaged in \nforming a Government, and that is why he is unable to \nbe in New York today.\n\nI want to begin by acknowledging the success of \nthe recent third International Conference on Small \nIsland Developing States, held in Samoa. The success \nof the Conference was the result of the extraordinary \nwork Samoa put into preparing for the Conference and \nthe ownership of the agenda that was demonstrated by \nthe small island developing States (SIDS). While it is \nundoubtedly true that small island developing States \nhave placed great value on the opportunity to talk, it \nis also true that there was an undertone of frustration, \nborn of the fact that too often in the past talk has not \nbeen followed by action. I strongly identify with that \nview. The multilateral world is awash with talk of plans \nand strategies and funds, while out there in the real \nworld of small island developing States, not enough is \nhappening on the ground. My country, New Zealand, is \nintent on avoiding that shortcoming, especially in our \nown region, the Pacific.\n\nRenewable energy featured strongly in the SIDS \nConference agenda, as it had at the Secretary-General\u2019s \n2014 Climate Summit in the past week. Pacific nations \nspend 10 per cent of their gross domestic product and up \nto 30 per cent of their entire import bills on importing \ndiesel fuel for electricity generation. Sustainable \neconomic development therefore simply cannot happen \nin our region without renewable energy.\n\nSignificant progress is being achieved, especially \nsince the Pacific Energy Summit 2013 that we co-hosted \nwith the European Union in Auckland in March 2013, \nat which $635 million in funding was committed for \nover 50 projects. The Tokelau Islands have moved from \n100 per cent dependence on fossil fuels to 93 per cent \nrenewable. During the SIDS Conference itself, we \nopened a 2.2-megawatt plant, a solar array in Samoa. \nA year earlier we opened a 1.2-megawatt plant in \nTonga. Next month, we will open a 1-megawatt array in \nRarotonga. And in the next 12 months, all of the outer \nislands of Tuvalu and all but one of the outer Cook \nIslands will be close to 100 per cent renewable. \n\nWe are making real progress towards converting \nour Pacific neighbourhood to renewable energy, \nbringing significant environmental benefits and \ngreatly enhancing prospects for sustainable economic \ndevelopment. My country has committed over \n$100 million to that process. We are not waiting for a \nnew multilateral agreement or a new green fund. We \nare simply getting ahead with robust partnerships and \nmaking it happen.\n\nAnother key topic at the SIDS Conference was \nsustainable fisheries. For our region, that is critically \nimportant. The biggest economic asset in the Pacific \nis its fisheries. In the past year, over $3.3 billion worth \nof tuna was harvested from Pacific waters, yet only \n14 per cent of that value, about $460 million, made \nits way back to Pacific nations. New Zealand has \ncommitted over $70 million over the next five years \nto advance a comprehensive approach that includes \nenhanced surveillance, training of monitors, training \nin commercial fishing practices, research and science \ninitiatives and improving management practices. Our \nobjective is to see the owners of the Pacific tuna resource \nreceive a significantly greater share of the value of that \nresource, and to ensure that it is sustainably managed \nfor the future.\n\nA key message from the SIDS Conference is the need \nto share experiences and skills among the SIDS regions. \nThat is starting to happen. Fisheries management is a \nprime candidate for greater cooperation. We have also \ncommenced a process of interregional cooperation in \nrenewable energy by supporting the development of \ngeothermal energy in the Caribbean and Africa.\n\nWhile small island developing States are showing \nreal leadership in addressing climate change and \nshifting to renewable energy, those issues require action \non a global scale. We therefore commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for convening the Climate Summit here in \nNew York last week. We are participating actively in \nthose negotiations and hope they will pave the way for \na successful conclusion in Paris next year. We have \nmade an initial commitment to the Green Climate \nFund to show our support for the global effort, but we \nwill unashamedly continue to prioritize making real \nprogress with real projects in our own region, which \nwill continue to consume the bulk of our resources.\n\nThe other major event that has recently taken place \nin the Pacific is the election in Fiji. We congratulate the \nPrime Minister, his party and the people of Fiji on their \nsuccessful return to democratic rule. Fiji\u2019s successful \nelections are hugely important for the region. I am \ndelighted that following the preliminary report of the \nmultinational observers group, both the Pacific Islands \nForum and the Commonwealth have commenced the \nprocess of lifting Fiji\u2019s suspension. We look forward to \nrebuilding and strengthening the connections between \nus. Neither New Zealand nor Fiji can contemplate a \nfuture that does not entail close and continuing links \nwith the other. We also welcomed the safe return of the \nFiji peacekeepers who were held hostage in the Golan \nHeights. That incident again underlined the great \nchallenges and the dangers faced by United Nations \npeacekeepers and the responsibilities we all have to \nensure the safety and security of peacekeeping and \nother United Nations personnel.\n\nIt is as well that we are able to note some bright \nspots for our region, because the situation in other parts \nof the world does look bleak. \n\nWhat happened over the past few months in \nGaza was an affront to humanity. No good was done \nfor the cause of Palestine by Hamas firing rockets \nindiscriminately into Israel. No good was done for peace \nin the Middle East by Israel pounding Gaza with such \nintensity and at such cost of civilian lives. We welcome \nthe ceasefire that was agreed after so many false starts \nand are thankful that so far it endures. We call on all \nsides not only to keep the guns and rockets silent but to \nrefrain from actions that may destabilize what can only \nbe described as an uneasy peace. In that connection, we \nexpress our profound regret at Israel\u2019s appropriation of \n400 hectares of privately owned Palestinian land near \nBethlehem for settlements. That act itself is profoundly \nunhelpful.\n\nThe problems of the Middle East are deep and \ndifficult. They go back to the earliest days of the \nOrganization and beyond. But what happened over \nthe past months in and in relation to Gaza was a \nmodern failure \u2014 a failure of leadership, of purpose \nand of vision. We urge the leaders of Israel and of \nPalestine, both West Bank and Gaza, to live up to their \nresponsibilities to their peoples and to their positions.\n\nIn Syria and Iraq, we see the truly frightening \nconsequences when leadership, both internally and \nin the Security Council, has failed. Syria has been a \nweeping sore for over three years. Thousands of Syrians \nhave died, millions have become refugees and all \nSyrian people have suffered terribly from the multiple \nconflicts engulfing the country. And now the tragedy \nof Syria has spilled over into Iraq, which was already \nwrestling with its own deep-seated problems. Many \nactors, in both the recent past and over a longer time \nframe, have had a hand in contributing to the situation \nwe now confront, but now it is time for action.\n\nWe need to find a way to contain the madness that \nis the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, to address \nthe humanitarian tragedy and to help the people of Syria \nand Iraq craft a better future. By any objective standard, \n\n\nthat is a situation that cries out for Security Council \nattention, and that is true of both sides of the border. \nWe need the Council members and the Governments \nconcerned to move past the ideological stalemate that \nhas kept the Council largely impotent for the past three \nyears. The challenge we all face in Syria and Iraq is \nunlike any the United Nations has faced before. The \npolitical circumstances in which it is being played out \nare about as bad as they get. Yet somehow we must find \na way of coming together to defeat that shared problem.\n\nParalysis has also prevailed in the Security Council \nover Ukraine. The Council has been essentially \na bystander as one of its permanent members has \nundermined the integrity of another Member State. We \nrecognize the difficulties of managing ethnic tensions \nthat straddle borders and the risks of local fires being \nstoked into wider national and international crises. But \nwith the strong shared histories of cooperation and \nachievement between Russia and Ukraine, there is no \nexcuse for leaders allowing matters to unravel as they \nhave, to the point where international peace and security \nmay be at risk. Already hundreds of innocent civilians \non Flight MH-17 lost their lives through an associated \nmistake and miscalculation. We welcome the ceasefire \nagreed earlier this month, which has held, for the most \npart. We call on all involved to step back, think about \nwhat is at stake and start rebuilding the trust essential \nto finding a lasting solution.\n\nEvents in the Middle East and Ukraine have \ndominated the headlines in recent months and have \ndiverted attention from the serious situations that \ncontinue to play out in Africa, particularly in Libya, \nMali, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, \nSomalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The \nUnited Nations is directly involved in those crises, \nand they continue to challenge the capacity of the \nOrganization and of the African Union to respond \nto the sheer scale of human suffering and to the \ncontinuing need for external assistance to restore and \nkeep the peace, keep civilian populations safe and \ndeliver humanitarian assistance. Those issues, no less \nthan those in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, \nwill continue to require constant attention from the \nSecurity Council and the coordinated efforts of the \nbroader United Nations family. They show that for all \nits failings and structural inequalities, the Council still \nhas a vital role to play in maintaining international \npeace and security.\n\nBut there is one lesson that we must learn from \nall those recent crises \u2014 the United Nations must \nfundamentally improve its performance in preventing \nconflict. Once fighting is in full spate, the options for \npeace disappear. Prevention is critical, not just in new \nconflicts, but also in the cases on the agenda where \nconflict has been frozen or where peacebuilding has \nnot really taken hold.\n\nWe are deeply troubled by the unprecedented scale \nof the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We recognize \nthe huge challenges it poses to the economies and \nthe political and security cohesion in the region. We \nhave contributed and will continue to contribute to the \nhumanitarian work under way, and on the formation of \na new Government, we will look at further practical \nsteps to support the international effort.\n\nIn 18 days\u2019 time, the United Nations membership \nwill decide who will be on the Security Council for the \nnext two-year term. New Zealand has been a candidate \nfor that position since 2004. It has been 20 years since \nwe were last on the Council. It has been a long and \ndemanding campaign, and it will continue right up to \nthe elections on 16 October. With tough competitors, \nsuch as our good friends Spain and Turkey, that has to \nbe the case. The campaign has been a great opportunity \nfor us to engage with nations around the world. We \ngreatly value the new relationships we have forged \nand the enhanced character of existing relationships. \nWhatever the outcome, we are determined to maintain \nthem. \n\nIn the past, New Zealand has demonstrated that as \na member of the Council it acts strongly, effectively and \nindependently. It champions the rights of small States \nand for the voices of all to be heard. In short, as my \nPrime Minister said from this rostrum last year, there \nis no point in joining the Council simply to make up the \nnumbers. Sometimes one has to speak up and shine a \nlight on what is going on, or not going on, even when it \nis embarassing or inconvenient to others to do so.\n\nAbove all, I can assure the Assembly that if we \nare elected, New Zealand will be a credible, positive \ninfluence on the Security Council. At our core, New \nZealand is an optimistic country and New Zealanders \nare an optimistic people. We believe that things can be \nbetter than they are and are prepared, as a people, to \nwork hard to achieve that. Despite the many challenges \non the international agenda, my hope is that the \nmembership of the United Nations will give us an \n\nopportunity to prove that by serving on the Security \nCouncil from next year.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nit gives me pleasure to congratulate the President of the \nAssembly and his friendly country on his assumption \nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. We are confident that he will lead its \nwork wisely, and we will lend him our support as \nhe undertakes his duties. I take this opportunity to \nexpress my sincere appreciation to his predecessor for \nhis untiring efforts as President of the Assembly at its \nprevious session. I also reiterate our full support to the \nSecretary-General as he strives to realize the purposes \nof the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nI stand before the Assembly today as one of the sons \nof Egypt, from the cradle of human civilization. From \nthis rostrum, I first salute the great people of Egypt. \nAllow me to also salute the thousands of Egyptians who \ntravelled from Egypt and various parts of the United \nStates and who are in the city today to say that the \nnew Egypt is coming. From this rostrum, I salute the \ngreat people of Egypt, who have made history twice \nin the past few years: first, when they revolted against \ncorruption and despotism and claimed their right to \nfreedom, dignity and social justice; and then when they \nheld fast to their identity and, energized by patriotism, \nrose up against exclusion, refusing to succumb to the \ntyranny of a faction which, in the name of religion, put \nits narrow interests before the interests of the people.\n\nThose are simply snapshots of the defining \nmoments Egypt has witnessed recently. They are only \nmilestones in the longer journey that Egyptians, fuelled \nby their dreams and aspirations, have embarked upon, \ntowards a better day and a more prosperous future. The \nworld is starting to grasp the reality of what happened \nin Egypt and to understand the circumstances that \ndrove Egyptians to intuitively take to the streets to \nrebel against the forces of extremism and darkness \nthat, once in power, undermined the foundations of the \ndemocratic process and national institutions and sought \nto impose a state of polarization in order to break the \nunity of the people.\n\nThe upsurge in extremism and violence perpetrated \nin the name of religion that the region is currently \nwitnessing is evidence of the true objectives of those \ngroups that exploit religion. We have warned against \nthem over and over again. They have transformed the \nvalues of justice, compassion and mercy, which are \ntreasured by Judaism, Christianity and Islam, into grim \nsectarianism and destructive civil and regional wars \nthat continue to claim the lives of innocent people of \ndifferent religions.\n\nThe Egyptian people understand \u2014 as do I, given \nthe responsibilities that I have shouldered since my \nelection as President \u2014 that the path towards achieving \nour goals began with the building of a civil democratic \nState, guided by the principles we sought to embody \nand adhering to the road map for the future agreed upon \nby the Egyptian national powers. That road map will \nbe completed when parliamentary elections are held, \nfollowing the presidential election and constitutional \nreferendum through which Egyptians expressed their \nfree will. Our aim is to build a new Egypt \u2014 a State \nthat respects rights and freedoms, honours its duties \nand ensures the coexistence of its citizens without \nexclusion or discrimination; a State that respects and \nenforces the rule of law, guarantees freedom of opinion \nfor all and ensures freedom of belief and worship for \nits people; and a State that is determined to achieve \ngrowth, prosperity and a promising future that meets \nthe aspirations of its people.\n\nTo that end, Egypt began implementing an ambitious \ncomprehensive programme to spur development \nuntil 2030, with the aim of laying the foundations of \na free-market economy that is capable of attracting \ninvestments in a secure and stable environment. The \nNew Suez Canal project, a gift from Egyptians to the \nworld, is proof of the seriousness of our intent and of the \nresolve of the new Egypt to forge a better tomorrow for \nits youth. That is why I invite members to participate \nin the economic conference that will be held in Egypt \nin February 2015 to achieve development and build the \nfuture, not only for Egypt, but for the entire region.\n\nThose steps briefly reflect the gist of the social \ncontract embraced by Egyptians in their new \nConstitution. It is to build a better today and a brighter \ntomorrow for our youth and to establish a State that is \narmed with strong institutions and governed by the rule \nof law; a State that respects the judiciary and ensures its \nindependence and applies the principle of the separation \nof powers; and a State that is not held back by a form \nof terrorism that thinks that it can conquer and repress \nour nation.\n\nEgypt has suffered from the scourge of that \nterrorism since the 1920s, when it concealed its \npoisonous viewpoints behind religion to reach power \n\n\nand establish the caliphate state, relying on armed \nviolence and terror to achieve its objectives and in \nthe process giving rise to a handful of extremists who \ncommit atrocities in the name of religion. Here I stress \nthat we should not allow them to abuse Islam and offend \nthe 1.5 billion Muslims who cherish its noble values. \nReligion, by virtue of its holiness and sanctity, cannot \nbe put to the test by humans and judged whether it has \nsucceeded or failed.\n\nTerrorism is a plague that does not differentiate \nbetween developing and developed societies as it \nspreads. Terrorists come from different societies. They \nare not bound together by any true religious faith. \nThat is why it is imperative that we all intensify our \ncooperation and coordination efforts, pursuant to the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and in \nfulfilment of its objectives, to end the support provided \nto those terrorist organizations that enables them to \ncontinue perpetrating crimes.\n\nThe problems facing our region emanate from \nthe space provided to the local and regional forces of \nextremism and the state of polarization that often leads \nto division and strife. They have become a serious \ndanger that threatens the very existence of the State and \nattacks its identity. That has produced fertile ground \nfor terrorism and its organizations to grow and gain \ninfluence.\n\nIn this regard, the crises facing some countries \nof the region could be resolved by following a two-\npronged approach aimed at building the nation State. \nThe first is the application of the principles of equality \nof all citizens and respect for the rule of law, based on a \nsocial contract and national consensus, while ensuring \nthe enjoyment by all of all rights, especially the right \nto development. That will safeguard societies from \nexploitation and prevent them from succumbing to \nextremism. The second aspect is a decisive confrontation \nwith the forces of extremism and terrorism and with \nany attempt to impose opinions through intimidation \nand violence or to force exclusion through rejection in \nall its forms.\n\nEgypt, in agreement with Libya\u2019s neighbouring \ncountries, has actually put forward an initiative that \nsets specific steps and a clear vision to end the plight \nof that kindred country. We can build on that initiative \nto achieve a comprehensive political solution that \nstrengthens Libya\u2019s elected institutions and ensures an \nend to the bloodshed, while preserving its territorial \nintegrity. Success requires effectively halting arms \ntrafficking into Libya and dealing relentlessly with \nthe extremist movements that resort to weapons and \nviolence and do not recognize the democratic process.\n\nDespite the heartrending humanitarian situation in \nfraternal Syria and the destruction and loss of innocent \nlives resulting from the crisis, I am confident that it \nis possible to establish a political framework that will \nensure that the aspirations of the Syrian people are met \nwithout compromising with terrorism or replicating the \ncircumstances that the Syrians initially rebelled against. \nI emphasize that Egypt supports the Syrian people\u2019s \naspirations to a safe and secure life that ensures Syria\u2019s \nstability and the unity of its people and preserves its \nterritorial integrity.\n\nThe formation in the brotherly country of Iraq \nof a new Government approved by the Parliament is \na significant development that restores hope in the \npossibility of improving the situation and for success \nin internal and external attempts to achieve stability, \nrestore the areas that have fallen under the control of \nthe terrorist group Daesh, maintain Iraq\u2019s territorial \nintegrity, end the bloodshed.\n\nDespite the multitude of crises threatening our \nregion, some of which I have mentioned, the Palestinian \nissue remains a top priority for Egypt. Palestinians \nstill aspire to establish their independent State on the \nterritories occupied in 1967, with East Jerusalem as \nits capital, on the basis of the principles of the peace \nprocess that was established in the 1970s, following \nan Egyptian initiative. Those principles are not up for \ncompromise; otherwise the basis of a comprehensive \npeace in the region would erode and the values of \njustice and humanity would vanish. The continued \ndeprivation of the Palestinian people of their rights is \nundoubtedly exploited by some to inflame other crises, \nachieve hidden goals, fragment Arab unity and impose \ntrusteeship on Palestinians under the guise of realizing \ntheir aspirations.\n\nI am confident that certain challenges will \nrequire us to work seriously and with a clear vision \nto achieve the ambitions of our people for democracy, \ndevelopment and human dignity and for our youth and \ntheir aspirations for a brighter future. Our success will \nguarantee the future of our people.\n\nFrom this rostrum, I call upon everyone to address \nthe Ebola epidemic. In many African countries, \ncombatting the disease is a collective responsibility. We \nmust be able to assist those countries that need help, \n\n\nwhile providing protection to our own people. Distances \nhave become shorter, due to modern advances, thus \nincreasing the threat. As a strong State, Egypt bears a \nspecial responsibility. In the 1990s, Egypt confronted \nterrorism and extremism. I am confident that it will \nsucceed in uprooting terrorism by virtue of its national \nidentity. Egypt will always be a beacon of civilization, \nsupporting cohesion in the region. Egyptians will never \nhesitate to assume their role to that effect.\n\nEgypt considers the security of the Arab States \nintegral to its national security, on the basis of our \ncommon heritage and destiny and our longing for the \nstability of a region that is important and crucial to \nthe world. Egypt\u2019s vision of international relations is \nfounded on respect for the principles of international \nlaw, treaties and conventions, based on mutual respect \nand mutual interests and benefits.\n\nAs the Assembly knows, Egypt was a founding \nMember of the United Nations and has ever since \nstrongly contributed to realizing its goals, especially in \npeacekeeping, peacebuilding and development. From \nthat standpoint, Egypt\u2019s aspiration to a non-permanent \nseat on the Security Council in 2016 and 2017 stems \nfrom its desire to use its membership to achieve the \npurposes of the Organization and protect the interests \nof developing countries, especially in Africa, as well as \nto accelerate the reform of the United Nations system \nas part of a broader vision based on the principle of \nequality of all nations. I therefore invite Member States \nto support Egypt\u2019s candidature for the Security Council.\n\nI have conveyed in all humility the message of the \nEgyptian people, women, men, youth and the elderly. \nIt is a message of hope, of will and of determination to \nwork. It is a message of openness, calling for cooperation \nwith all, to overcome all obstacles and difficulties. I \nwish to assure the Assembly that the Egyptian people, \nafter their two revolutions, have become the sole source \nof our internal and external policies in pursuit of \nstability and development.\n\nEgypt today has regained its self-confidence and is \nupholding the principles of law and freedom. With its \nArab identity and African roots, it is the cradle of the \nMediterranean civilization and the beacon of moderate \nIslam. Egypt aspires to resolve regional disputes and \nuphold the principles of justice and humanity in today\u2019s \nworld. I am confident that Egyptians have an infinite \ncapacity to give. We have inherited that gift from our \nancestors and will remain ever generous, God willing.\n\nLong live Egypt. Long live the peace-loving peoples \nof the world. Long live the principles of humanity and \nthe values of tolerance and coexistence. May peace be \nupon the Assembly, and the mercy and blessings of God \nas well.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I thank the \nGeneral Assembly for electing His Excellency Mr. Sam \nKutesa, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \n\nAs the Assembly knows, the United Nations system \nneeds reform to reflect the new needs and realities in the \nworld today. Uganda will use the time of its presidency \nto make a small contribution towards the reform of \nthe United Nations and its organs by pushing for the \nAfrican agenda on that issue. Those reforms, as will be \nagreed by all of us, will strengthen the United Nations, \nnot otherwise.\n\nAfrica, Uganda included, is at long last emerging \nfrom the long night of decline that the continent has \nbeen through in the last 500 years \u2014 ever since 1472, \nwhen the Portuguese started encroaching on the African \ncoastline. Those 500 years witnessed great traumas \ninflicted on the African continent, including the slave \ntrade, colonialism, neocolonialism, plunder, human \nhaemorrhage and, in some cases, even genocide. Those \ntraumas resulted in the haemorrhage of the population \nand the depopulation of the African continent to \nthe extent that by 1900 the population of the whole \nof Africa was only 133 million people, while that of \nChina, which is only one quarter of the land area of \nAfrica, was 489,000 million people. In other words, by \n1990, the population of the whole of Africa was only a \nquarter of that of China, in a land area four times larger. \n\nSuch traumas were possible in Africa owing not \nonly to internal weaknesses but also external factors. \nForeign aggression caused serious distortions in \nAfrican societies. There was, for instance, the very-\nwell-organized Kingdom of Kongo on the Atlantic \ncoast at the time the first Portuguese explorer, Diego \nC\u00e3o, arrived there in 1483. The Kingdom covered parts \nof northern Angola, Cabinda, parts of the Republic \nof Congo and the western parts of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo. As a consequence of the actions \nof colonialism, that polity, that Kingdom, declined and \ndisintegrated. \n\nIt is only now that the modern countries of that \narea are regenerating that portion of Africa. It is those \ndistortions and the original endogenous weaknesses of \nAfrica that the present generation of African leaders \nhave been addressing. In many African countries, \npositive results are beginning to manifest themselves. \nThe middle class in Africa is now of the magnitude of \n313 million people, and that has boosted the purchasing \npower of Africa to $2.5 trillion. That purchasing power \nis growing at the rate of 3.2 per cent per annum. That \ngrowth and expansion of the African gross domestic \nproduct and purchasing power has happened despite \ninadequate roads, inadequate railways, inadequate \nelectricity, and so on. Once those strategic bottlenecks \nare addressed, the sky will be the limit as far as Africa\u2019s \npotential is concerned. \n\nOne bottleneck that has bedevilled Africa has been \nthe espousing of the pseudo-ideology of religious or \ntribal sectarianism, as well as chauvinism vis-\u00e0-vis \nwomen. When President Obama was walking out, I met \nhim at the door and told him that he had copied some of \nmy statement. That pseudo-ideology has fuelled most \nof the conflicts in Africa. We are also witnessing the \nsame pseudo-ideology causing havoc in the Middle East \nand North Africa. When uninformed outsiders link up \nwith those pseudo-ideologists, the permutation is most \ntragic. Sectarian ideology is pseudo and bankrupt \nbecause it is at variance with the people\u2019s real interests \nof symbiosis and the exchange of goods and services, \nas well as integration for mutual benefit. Only parasites \nrevel in such schemes. That pseudo-ideology should be \nbanished and treated with the contempt that it deserves.\n\nWith regard to socioeconomic transformation, \nUganda is busy building hard-surface roads, electricity \nnetworks, railways, information and communication \ntechnology networks, a universal education system \nand a pan-Ugandan health-care system. Together with \nour neighbours, we have integrated our markets in the \nEast African Community and the Common Market for \nEastern and Southern Africa. We also partner with \nothers on common security solutions. Africa and the \nindividual African countries are therefore becoming \nmore credible partners with all serious actors beyond \nour shores. \n\nUganda needs and welcomes investment, trade \naccess, tourists and, in some cases, security partnerships \nthat are approved by the African Union with our \npartners in the world, many of whom are Members of \nthe United Nations."

My delegation joins previous \ndelegations in congratulating you on your election, \nwhich simultaneously pays tribute to our sister nation of \nUganda and recognizes your personal and professional \nqualities as an experienced diplomat. We wish you \nsuccess in carrying out your term and assure you, Sir, \nof the Cabo Verde delegation\u2019s support and cooperation.\n\nTo your predecessor, the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session, His Excellency \nAmbassador John Ashe, we would like to and express \nour recognition of and appreciation for the dedicated, \ndynamic and able manner in which he guided the work \nof the previous session. We would also like to take \nthis opportunity, on behalf of the Government of Cabo \nVerde, to congratulate and pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts in seeking peace \nand global solutions for the challenges that currently \nconfront us and require shared political will in the \npursuit of global solutions.\n\nAs a small island State, Cabo Verde is particularly \ngrateful to the Secretary-General and the international \ncommunity for convening, and the success achieved in, \nthe third United Nations Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, held in Samoa. We also congratulate \nthe Secretary-General for his initiative in convening \nthe United Nations Climate Summit 2014, as the \nissue of climate change is of particular importance to \nisland States, due to our specific vulnerabilities. For \nus, finding solutions to the adverse effects of climate \nchange is not just an option, but a matter of survival \nand territorial integrity, making it essential to mobilize \nthe political will and international cooperation with \nrespect to that issue. The strategies recently agreed \nupon in Samoa point to paths, modalities of action \nand effective implementation that will increase those \nStates\u2019 resilience and make them better equipped to \ndeal with the consequences of climate change.\n\nCabo Verde is pleased with the adoption of \nurgent measures to face climate change as one of the \nsustainable development goals. The achievement of \nthat goal requires development strategies and policies \nthat will help create a more resilient planet Earth and \nstrengthen the means of their implementation.\n\nThe data recently released in the fifth assessment \nreport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nfocus our attention on alarming scenarios resulting \nfrom the persistent increase in global warming, which \nwill put the more vulnerable countries in situations \nthat may threaten their development. It should be \nnoted that, in addition to other consequences, there \nwill be an increase in tropical cyclones, drought and \n\ndesertification, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, \nloss of biodiversity, weak agricultural production and \nfood insecurity. For the Government of Cabo Verde, \nit is important to ensure that the negotiations that \nwill take place next December in Lima translate into \nsignificant progress with respect to the content of the \nnew agreement to be signed in Paris in December 2015.\n\nRaising awareness regarding the need to reduce \nthe levels of global warming and to foster low-carbon \neconomies must also be taken into consideration. We \nsupport reducing global warming to under 1.5\u00b0C, which \nis both economically feasible and a basic requirement \nfor sustainable global development. We also hope that, \nas we work towards the conversion of our interests, the \nfoundational principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibility will be respected. A compensation \nmechanism for the effective and full implementation \nof the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and \nDamage should be considered. We are convinced that, \nif nothing is done, the consequences resulting from \nclimate change will affect us all and that we all will \npay for our inaction. As the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations likes to say, we are all in the same boat.\n\nInternational cooperation, both with respect to \nclimate change and in other areas, is key. In order to be \neffective, it must be more consistent and pragmatic in \nnational systems and international structures alike, and \ndevelopment financing for countries must be based on \ncriteria reflecting their real needs and vulnerabilities.\n\nWe hope that clear directives and commitments \nare agreed upon in the next Conference on Financing \nfor Development, to be held in Addis Ababa in July \n2015, and that they lead the way to achieving the \nunfinished business of Millennium Development Goal \n8. We hope that they will ensure the redefinition of \nthe criteria for the allocation of financial resources \nfor development based on the principles adopted in \nParis and reaffirmed in Busan. For Cabo Verde, a \ncountry that recently graduated into middle-income \nstatus, albeit lower-middle-income, it is important \nthat innovative mechanisms be designed to provide for \ngreater consistency in development financing and to \nsupport economic sustainability.\n\nThe previous session of the General Assembly was \nconvened under the theme \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d. The theme chosen for \nthis session is \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d. We \nare thus asked to take the next step \u2014 that is, to work \non the adoption of a people-centred agenda aiming \nto eradicate extreme poverty and reduce inequalities \namong nations. That request is made in a complex \nand difficult international environment. In our view, \nit will be achievable only if there is solidarity and if \nthe international community joins forces to promote \nsustainable development.\n\nThe results achieved under the framework of the \nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals, \nwhich conducted its work during the previous session of \nGeneral Assembly, point to possible actions and options \nfor a truly transformative post-2015 agenda. With \nrespect to Cape Verde, our country is close to achieving \nall the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For \nus, the post-2015 agenda must reflect all lessons and \nassessments of the MDGs and other internationally \nagreed goals, and the goals for 2030 must provide for \nthe acceleration of the development process.\n\nWe would also like to briefly note that the twenty-\nninth special session of the General Assembly on the \nfollow-up to the Programme of Action of the International \nConference on Population and Development was held on \n22 September. The lesson that we can take away from \nthat important event is that the post-2015 agenda must \nplace people at the centre of the objectives and goals to \nbe agreed upon, which also means rigorous respect for \nhuman rights. On the other hand, the common good, \nprogress and the well-being of all citizens must be goals \nto be pursued by all Governments as we develop and \nimplement our development policies and programmes.\n\nIn addition to being a matter of social justice, \nensuring gender equality and equity also turns out to be \na smart choice, as no country can aspire to develop and \nestablish social peace and cohesion while excluding \na significant portion of its population \u2014 that is, the \nfemale population.\n\nGender-based violence is an unacceptable \nphenomenon in our societies. The Government of \nCabo Verde is committed to changing the reality in our \ncountry in a significant and positive way, even as we \nare aware that there still is much to do in that regard.\n\nThe issues related to international security and the \nthreats against peace that they represent are matters \nof particular concern. The recent upsurge in acts \nof terrorism is a genuinely dangerous threat to the \nterritorial integrity of States and to the stability of \nentire regions. The systematic and massive violation of \nhuman rights and the barbarism that has come with it are \n\naltogether unacceptable. The international community \ncannot allow this challenge to the humanistic values of \nour civilization, which are also enshrined and promoted \nby the United Nations. The Government of Cabo Verde \ntherefore vigorously condemns all forms of terrorism \nand calls on the international community to urgently \ntake appropriate measures to stop such attempts to \nwreak havoc and mete out suffering to innocent people.\n\nWe are particularly concerned with recent \ndevelopments in the Middle East and Africa. We \nbelieve that States have the moral obligation and \ncollective duty to fight against the subversion of the \nuniversal principles of peace, tolerance and respect for \ndifferences. We believe that the United Nations has an \nimportant role to play when it comes to respect for the \nprinciples set out in its Charter and in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights.\n\nCabo Verde is a peace-loving nation that favours \ndialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We \nbelieve in and defend the principles of the Charter, as \nwell as observance of the standards of international law, \nrespect for human rights and the promotion of human \ndignity. As a result, we understand that no State or \norganization can replace the United Nations in playing \nits fundamental role of maintaining global peace and \nsecurity and that any use of force can be tolerated only \nwhen exercised within the framework of the principles \nset forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nCabo Verde sees urgency in finding a solution \nfor the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and believes that \nthere is no justification for the deaths of thousands \nof innocent people, the unwarranted suffering of an \nentire population and the desolation and destruction of \ninfrastructure in the Gaza Strip. We therefore urge the \nparties to begin negotiations that lead to lasting peace \nand that allow both States, Israel and Palestine, to live \nside by side in security. We also consider it important \nto find a negotiated means to end the conflict in Syria \nand to open humanitarian aid corridors.\n\nWe are concerned with the conflicts that persist \non our continent, such as in Libya, the Central African \nRepublic and the Great Lakes region, as well as the \nactions of terrorist groups in Somalia, Mali and Nigeria. \nWe support and stand side by side with the African \nUnion in finding solutions to the problems that affect \npeace and security in those sister nations and on the \ncontinent in general.\n\nIn the context of Africa, we also wish to commend \nthe progress achieved in the Republic of Guinea-\nBissau, its return to constitutional order and the \nre-establishment of democracy. We wish our sister \nnation the greatest success in the pursuit of peace and \ndevelopment.\n\nIn the West African subregion, the issue of security \nin general and maritime security in particular is of \nparticular concern to the authorities of Cabo Verde. \nOur country is located at the confluence of routes \nconnecting the African, European and American \ncontinents, which places us in a vulnerable situation, \nas these routes are also used by transnational organized \ncrime, resulting in a direct threat to the stability of \nStates and their democracies.\n\nCabo Verde, in association with other States \nand organizations in the United Nations system, \nhas attempted to combat the illegal activities that \nhave unfairly punished this part of the West African \nsubregion, such as the trafficking in drugs, arms and \nhuman beings, maritime piracy, terrorism and illegal \nfishing. As those are phenomena of a transnational \nnature, we believe that no country in the subregion \nis in a position to effectively combat them without \ngreater international cooperation and the combination \nof efforts, means and strategies. Therefore, we would \nlike to count on more consistent support from the \ninternational community.\n\nThe Security Council has rightly determined \nthat the current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a \nthreat to international security. The situation in the \nthree countries most affected by the epidemic should \nprompt the international community to engage in more \norganized and coordinated actions to provide aid, more \neffectively save lives and prevent the spread of the \ndisease to neighbouring countries, to the rest of Africa \nand to the world.\n\nCabo Verde welcomes and supports the efforts \nmade by all nations and organizations involved in \nthat struggle, particularly the Secretary-General\u2019s \ninitiatives in that regard. The inclusion of this issue in \nthe Security Council agenda, the adoption of resolution \n2177 (2014) by unanimity, and the debate that followed \n(see S/PV.7268) are an unequivocal expression of the \ninternational community\u2019s awareness of the priority \nthat must be given to the efforts to halt and control the \nepidemic, which could have catastrophic consequences \nfor our affected sister nations, particularly the Republics \n\nof Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, to which Cabo \nVerde offers its friendship and solidarity."

        "file_text": "In what can seem to be \ndarkening times, I want to begin with a message of \nhope. Amid all our problems, the murderous rage of \nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Syria and \nIraq, Russian aggression in Ukraine, the spread of \nEbola in West Africa and the stubborn sluggishness of \nmany economies, let me start with a small but telling \nillustration of nations working together to serve our \ncommon humanity. Last March, at the height of the \nsearch for the missing Flight MH-70, I went to the Pearce \nairbase in Western Australia to thank all the aviators \ninvolved. There were personnel from Australia, New \nZealand, Malaysia and the United States \u2014 countries \nthat are accustomed to working together. There were \nalso personnel from China, Japan and Korea \u2014 countries \nwhose relations sometimes labour under the weight of \nhistorical grievances.\n\n\nOn that occasion, however, the tragedy and a \ndaunting challenge drew out the best in everyone. \nThe Organization was founded on the principle that \nwe should work together for the common good and \nthat, over time, talking together and working together \nwill improve our capacity for living together. Like \nany institution, the United Nations is an imperfect \ninstrument. Still, it is better than \u201cmight is right\u201d, and \nit gives good arguments the best chance to prevail.\n\nDespite faults and failures, the United Nations \nhas worked for peace and progress for nearly 70 years. \nAustralia has been proud to play its part, starting in \n1946, when we held the first presidency of the Security \nCouncil and helped to draft the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights. At the heart of the Organization is the \nprinciple that we should act towards others as we would \nhave them act towards us. For almost seven decades, \nAustralia has believed in the potential of the United \nNations and supported its work. Keeping commitments, \nvaluing human life, protecting property and extending \nfreedom are universal aspirations, not only Australian \nones.\n\nSince 1947, we have provided more than 65,000 \npersonnel to more than 50 multilateral peace and \nsecurity operations. We are not a country accustomed to \nturning back, once we have put our hand to the plough. \nWe have had Blue Beret personnel in the Middle East \nsince 1956 and in Cyprus since 1964. When leadership \nis needed, we step up, as we did in Bougainville, \nin Timor-Leste and in Solomon Islands. In Korea, \nCambodia, Kuwait and Afghanistan and in Somalia, \nSierra Leone and other troubled places, Australians \nhave lent a hand under the United Nations banner. We \nhave only 21 personnel in South Sudan now but have \nconducted an airlift of equipment that has supported a \nmuch larger force.\n\nWith just 24 million people, Australia is a relatively \nsmall country, but we have the world\u2019s twelfth- \nlargest economy, with global interests and with some \nglobal reach. We are strong enough to be useful but \npragmatic enough to know our limits. Under successive \nGovernments, for more than 100 years, Australia\u2019s \ndetermination has been to advance our interests, \nto protect our citizens and to uphold our values. \nWe have never believed that we can save the world \nsingle-handedly, nor have we shrunk from shouldering \nour responsibilities. After the 2004 East Asian tsunami, \nwe committed $1 billion to Indonesia. We were one of \nthe first countries to arrive with help in Japan after the \n2011 earthquake and in the Philippines after the 2013 \ntyphoon.\n\nTo date, we have pledged $8 million towards \ncombating the Ebola outbreak, and dozens of Australian \nhealth professionals are working with international \nagencies in the region. To us, this is all part of being a \ngood global citizen. Last July, we were pleased to sponsor \nSecurity Council resolution 2166 (2014) and to work \nwith the Dutch and the Malaysians to investigate the \ncrash site and recover our dead, after Malaysia Airlines \nFlight MH-17 was shot down by Russian-backed rebels \nover eastern Ukraine. We are grateful for the help that \nUkraine gave us, and are naturally sympathetic to a \ncountry struggling to preserve its independence and \nterritorial integrity against a bully. With the Dutch and \nthe Malaysians, we will do everything we can to ensure \nthat the investigation is not undermined, and that the \ncrime is not covered up, because that is our duty to the \n38 Australians murdered in this atrocity.\n\nRight now, an Australian force has been deployed \nto the Middle East, so that we can join a coalition \nseeking to disrupt and degrade the Islamic State of \nIraq and the Levant terrorist movement at the request \nof the Iraqi Government. One of our prime ministers \nonce talked about our country\u2019s great objective, \u201cour \nlight on the hill,\u201d as he put it, namely, to work for the \nbetterment of mankind, not just at home, but wherever \nwe can lend a helping hand. To build a better world, \nwe need to respond sensibly to the problems before us, \nwhether through bodies such as the United Nations, \nor in coalitions with like-minded countries. We also \nneed to work purposefully to create stronger and more \nresilient people and communities. A stronger economy \nwill not solve every problem, but it will make almost \nevery problem easier to tackle. Richer people are not \nnecessarily better people, but the problems of plenty \nare invariably easier to deal with than those of want.\n\nAs this year\u2019s Chair of the Group of Twenty (G-\n20), Australia is determined to promote private-sector-\nled growth: growth, because that is the best way \nto generate jobs and improve everyone\u2019s quality of \nlife; private-sector-led, because profitable, private \nbusinesses are the best source of real, sustainable \nwealth. Freer trade, more investment in infrastructure, \na modern and fair international tax system, stronger \nglobal economic institutions and a more resilient \nfinancial sector are all parts of our G-20 agenda to \nstrengthen the world economy.\n\n\nRather than preaching, we are trying to lead by \nexample. Australia has abolished the carbon tax and \nthe mining tax, and we have provided environmental \napprovals for $800 billion worth of new projects. We \nhave also begun the task of eliminating our budget \ndeficit within four years. We have finalized a series of \ntrade deals, because every time a country trades with \nanother, wealth increases, and when wealth increases, \ncountries grow stronger. Our G-20 goal is to boost \noutput by an extra 2 per cent over the next five years \nto create millions of jobs and to generate trillions in \nwealth right around the world.\n\nLikewise, the post-2015 development agenda \nshould also focus on economic growth, because growth \nmakes every other social goal, even tackling climate \nchange, easier to accomplish. To people who do not \nknow where their next meal is coming from, talk of \neconomic growth can seem ignorant or indulgent. But \n\u201ceconomic growth\u201d is really just economists\u2019 shorthand \nfor more jobs, higher pay, new industries and the better \nlife that only greater wealth can provide. Economic \ngrowth might seem a mundane vision, but it allows \nmillions more people to create their own vision of how \ntheir lives can be better.\n\nTo anyone who doubts that stronger economic \ngrowth can be achieved, I say, \u201cLook at the countries \nof East Asia\u201d. In scarcely two generations, the rise \nof Asia has driven the greatest social and economic \ntransformation in history. People live longer, they are \nbetter educated, wealthier and, yes, they enjoy a level \nof freedom and stability that their parents could only \ndream of. In Japan, Korea and now China, in India and \nincreasingly in Indonesia, many hundreds of millions \nof people have been lifted from poverty to the middle \nclass. Almost certainly, that is the greatest and fastest \nadvance in human welfare of all time.\n\nWhile all Governments, Australia\u2019s included, could \nalways be better, smarter and more compassionate, \nno one should be blind to the great progress that has \noccurred. We live in the most remarkable age in human \nhistory. For all the work that remains to be done, we \nhave seen more change for the better than at any other \ntime.\n\nAs the General Assembly session meets with \nsuch pressing issues before it, our challenge \u2014 as \nalways \u2014 is to realize our best hopes and to be our best \nselves. Australians have two defining characteristics: \nwe believe in a \u201cfair go\u201d, because innate decency \ndemands that every person have a chance to contribute. \nWe also believe in \u201chaving a go\u201d, because rolling up \nyour sleeves will always produce a better result than \nstanding on the sidelines complaining. That readiness \nto make an effort for a good cause is why Australia \nfeels so comfortable in this body and is so ready to \ncontribute to its work. We should put no limits on what \nwe can achieve, especially when we work together, trust \npeople and are faithful to our deepest values.\n\nEvery country counts. Every argument must be \nweighed. Every person has equal rights and dignity. \nEvery person deserves respect. All people are entitled \nto make their own choices \u2014 provided they do not \ninfringe on the rights of others. Those are the principles \nthat this Organization embodies and on which the \nfuture of humanity rests.\n"

        "file_text": "On 17 July, in a summer \nalready marked by alarming reports from Syria, \nIraq and Gaza, our country was confronted with a \n\nstark international reality. The 298 passengers of \nFlight MH-17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea \nconflict and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Of \nthose victims, 196 were Dutch nationals.\n\nThat tragedy has had an enormous impact on \nour country \u2014 so many innocent men, women and \nchildren, entire families ripped from neighbourhoods, \nempty desks in offices and schools, teammates gone \nforever. Everyone in the Netherlands knew someone in \nthat plane, directly or indirectly, and we will feel the \npain for years to come. Some of the victims still have \nnot been identified, and that must be done as soon as \npossible. Nothing is more important to their loved ones, \nwherever in the world they may be.\n\nThis summer we were reminded again of how \nclosely interwoven events at home and abroad can be \nand how important a stable world order is to our national \ninterests. We saw again that when it comes to addressing \nthe major problems facing the global community, there \nis simply no alternative to working together. That is the \nfirm conviction of the Dutch Government.\n\nWe are grateful for the wide support for Security \nCouncil resolution 2166 (2014). All remains and personal \nbelongings must be repatriated. The cause of the Flight \nMH-17 disaster must be brought to light, and those \nresponsible must be brought to justice. Unhindered \naccess to the crash site is therefore essential. The Dutch \nGovernment is fully committed to achieving those \ngoals, working with all the countries and organizations \ninvolved.\n\nThe Constitution of the Netherlands contains a \nunique article that says, \u201cThe Government shall promote \nthe development of the international legal order\u201d. That \nself-imposed responsibility comes from a long tradition \nof freedom, respect for the rule of law and our country\u2019s \ninternational orientation. In March, we put that principle \ninto practice once again when we hosted the Nuclear \nSecurity Summit, a conference on an important topic \nthat must remain high on the international agenda. The \nevents of this summer have made us even more resolute \nabout promoting the international legal order and about \nworking to that end with everyone here in the General \nAssembly, in the knowledge that peace, justice and \ndevelopment are closely interconnected.\n\nThe year 2015 is an important one for the global \ndevelopment agenda. We will be reviewing the \nMillennium Development Goals and raising the \nbar once again. In July this year, the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid \nfoundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands\u2019 \npriorities. The most important goal is to eradicate \nextreme poverty within a generation in a way that \ndoes not harm economic growth, social equality or the \nenvironment. We must link short-term goals with long-\nterm goals.\n\nDespite the progress made, we know that fragile \nStates, where the rule of law barely exists, had no \nchance of achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. In 2013 there were more displaced people in \nconflict regions than ever before. For those reasons, \nthe Netherlands applauds the Open Working Group\u2019s \nintention to include peace and the rule of law in the new \nframework.\n\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s announced \nintention to establish the United Nations Mission for \nEbola Emergency Response. The Netherlands will \nsubstantially increase its humanitarian aid. Part of that \neffort is a new contribution of \u20ac18 million to the fight \nagainst Ebola.\n\nIn the same vein, the Netherlands will continue to \nsupport and participate in United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions. We currently have military personnel and \nrelief workers serving in Mali, South Sudan and \nelsewhere. The upcoming review of peacekeeping \nmissions is an opportunity to improve the instrument \nand make it more effective. The Netherlands believes \nthat major progress can be made on that front by further \nintegrating the three Ds: defence, development and \ndiplomacy.\n\nOur commitment to fulfilling Security Council \nresolution 1325 (2000) remains firm too, because \nwomen\u2019s leadership is essential to achieving peace and \nsecurity. The important role that women play as change \nagents in politics, economic development and society \ncannot be emphasized enough.\n\nAs host country to many international legal \ninstitutions, including the International Court of Justice \nand the International Criminal Court, the Netherlands \nfeels a special responsibility with respect to international \nlaw. When innocent people fall victim to impunity, \nhuman rights violations and the violence of war, the \ninternational community cannot and should not just \nstand by and just watch. Perpetrators must be brought \nto justice, however complex and time-consuming the \nprocess may be. We owe this not only to the passengers \nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, but also to the \n\nvictims of violence in Syria and in Iraq. The horrifying \nimages of mass executions and beheadings in the region \nare burned into our memories. They impress upon \nus how important it is for the Security Council and \ninternational legal institutions to be able to act boldly \nand decisively.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands, a partner for \npeace, justice and development, is a candidate for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2017 \nand 2018. We want to help modernize and strengthen \nthat important United Nations body. Renewal is \nneeded to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. The \nSecurity Council must be able to act in a crisis. When \nmass atrocities are being committed somewhere in the \nworld, veto power should be exercised with greater \nrestraint. We salute the French initiative in that regard. \nWe also believe that the Security Council\u2019s authority \nand resolve would be enhanced if the United Nations \nMember States were more broadly represented. That \nis especially true of the African States which, in our \nopinion, are underrepresented.\n\nIn closing, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld once said that\n\n\u201c[t]he principles of the Charter are, by far, greater \nthan the Organization in which they are embodied, \nand the aims which they are to safeguard are holier \nthan the policies of any single nation or people\u201d \n(S/PV.751, para. 4).\nThe Netherlands shares that conviction and remains \nsteadfast in its commitment to promoting the \ninternational legal order, as our Constitution demands.\n"

        "file_text": "We are gathered here at a time when the world is facing pressing global challenges and security threats that \nmust be addressed collectively and with urgency. Our \nplanet is heating up owing to the clear and imminent \ndanger of climate change. Terrorism is rearing its ugly \nhead once again. The global village is gripped with fear \nof the spreading Ebola epidemic. Tension and mistrust \nare building up among the major Powers, reminiscent \nof the rivalry of the Cold War. The number and scale \nof regional and local conflicts is growing in some parts \nof the world. One billion people are still trapped in \npoverty. The world we want is still a distant dream.\n\nClimate change is no longer merely an issue for \nscientific argument; it is one of survival that requires our \nurgent action. Many developing countries economically \ndependent on agriculture, as well as small island States, \nwill bear the brunt of its impact. It is of the utmost \nimportance that we agree a new global commitment \non climate protection and emissions-reduction \nobjectives. My delegation is therefore thankful to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for organizing the \nClimate Summit 2014, whose message that urgent and \nunited action is needed was loud and clear. Myanmar \nwill continue to work together with the international \ncommunity towards a meaningful, implementable and \nuniversal climate agreement in Paris in 2015.\n\nIn support of the vision of the President of the \nGeneral Assembly for a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, we must intensify our efforts at \nthis session to set the world on the path to sustainable \ndevelopment in its economic, social and environmental \ndimensions. In that process, we must also work together \nto find effective means for implementation, including \nthe mobilization of financial and technological support, \nin order to ensure the success of the new agenda and the \nsustainable development goals.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa, with its \nunprecedented nature and scope, is alarming. We must \nnot see that outbreak as unique to one particular people \nor place. It is a common challenge to all of humankind. \nMyanmar welcomes the swift and timely response by \nthe Secretary-General in proactively establishing the \nUnited Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.\n\nTerrorism cannot be condoned for any reason \nor under any circumstances. Ruthless killings and \natrocities in the name of religion must not be tolerated. \nMyanmar has always opposed terrorism in all its forms \nand manifestations. We are not oblivious to the fate \nof those who have fallen victims to terrorism. The \ninternational community must be united to eliminate \nthose horrible crimes. In that regard, my delegation \nfully supports the statement issued by the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers \na few days ago here in New York.\n\nMyanmar firmly believes in the continued relevance \nand legitimacy of the United Nations in world affairs. \nWe will continue to actively cooperate with it, in line \nwith the principles of our foreign policy. Thanks to the \npositive changes in Myanmar, the cooperation between \nMyanmar and the United Nations is now better than \never. The United Nations and its agencies are showing \ngreater interest in Myanmar, extending a helping hand \nto the people of Myanmar in all aspects of their lives. \nThe Government, for its part, is facilitating the effective \nimplementation of the United Nations missions.\n\nThe maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is one of the main purposes of the United \nNations. Myanmar, as a peace-loving nation, abhors \nweapons of mass destruction and is fully cognizant of \nthe danger of nuclear weapons. To that end, Myanmar \nhas annually submitted, since 1995, a draft resolution \non nuclear disarmament. We will do so once again \nat the present session of the General Assembly. We \nencourage all Member States to positively support \nour draft resolution. If we follow the road map in the \nresolution with a strong political will, a world free of \nnuclear weapons will be within our grasp soon.\n\nI would like to inform the Assembly that Myanmar \nis making domestic preparations with a view to \nratifying major international disarmament instruments. \nConsiderable achievements have been made in that \nprocess. I am pleased to announce that the Pyidaungsu \nHluttaw, our Union Parliament, has just approved \nMyanmar\u2019s accession to the Biological Weapons \nConvention.\n\nThe winds of change have blown across Myanmar \nover the past three years. The scope and pace of \npositive changes in Myanmar have earned remarkable \nrecognition and encouragement from the international \ncommunity. Those changes have contributed to raising \nMyanmar\u2019s profile in the regional and international \narena. On the regional stage, Myanmar held the Chair \nof the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral \nTechnical and Economic Cooperation until March this \nyear. After successfully carrying out that responsibility, \nwe are now shouldering the prestigious responsibility of \nchairing ASEAN. Under our chairmanship, ASEAN is \n\nexerting its efforts to speed up the ASEAN community-\nbuilding process with the theme of \u201cMoving forward in \nunity to a peaceful and prosperous community\u201d.\n\nMyanmar is advancing well on the path of peaceful \ndemocratic transition, which began over three years \nago by setting in motion various waves of political \nand economic reforms. The first wave was the \npeaceful transformation from a military Government \nto a multiparty democratic system, where all political \nforces are working together to overcome differences \nthrough dialogue in our two houses of Parliament. An \nall-inclusive political system has been established, \nbringing in all stakeholders in the process through \nnational reconciliation. The first wave of reform \nbrought about national reconciliation, the granting of \na series of amnesties, the creation of greater political \nspace, freedom of the media, freedom of expression, \nand freedom of association and peaceful assembly. It \nwas followed by the second wave of reform, unleashing \nan array of political, economic, administrative and \nprivate sector development reforms. Now, the third \nwave of reform has been launched, which aims at laying \ndown a firm foundation for a new democratic State and \ndelivering benefits to the people by fulfilling their \nsocioeconomic needs. We are determined to keep the \nreforms on track through ensuring peace, stability and \nnational reconciliation.\n\nSince our democracy is still in its infancy, we are \nfacing a multitude of daunting challenges, like other \ncountries in transition. The Government has a long to-\ndo list despite its limited capacity. We are determined to \novercome the challenges and we are convinced that we \nwill achieve our objectives. We need the international \ncommunity\u2019s understanding and continued support in \nour efforts for economic development and capacity-\nbuilding to lay a solid foundation for a democratic \nsociety.\n\nOne of the issues that attracts domestic and \ninternational attention is the process of amending \nMyanmar\u2019s present Constitution. In that regard, \nthe Pyidaungsu Hluttaw set up the Constitutional \nAmendment Review Joint Committee in July last \nyear. Further, after soliciting suggestions and \nrecommendations from the general public and political \nparties, the Constitutional Amendment Implementation \nCommittee was formed to address the issues of \nconstitutional amendment based on the suggestions \nreceived.\n\nPutting democratic values into practice, the \nGovernment is placing much more emphasis and \nconsideration on the aspirations of our people as a whole. \nAccordingly, we are laying foundations to successfully \nconduct an independent, free and fair election within \na legal framework that does not compromise national \nsovereignty. In that context, Myanmar recently received \nthe visit of a needs assessment mission from the United \nNations. All existing political parties are expected to \ntake part in the elections. The final decision will be \nmade by the people on election day.\n\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for political \nstability and for the socioeconomic development of \nthe country. Strengthening national reconciliation is \nan integral part of our reform process. We are working \ntogether with all ethnic armed groups in good faith to \nreach a nationwide ceasefire agreement. So far we have \nalready reached such an agreement with 14 out of the 16 \ngroups. We are now working on a draft framework for \npolitical dialogue that will pave the way for bringing an \nend to the six-decade long conflict.\n\nThe Government is serious in its commitment to \nthe success of the peace process. It is open to discussing \nall issues, except those that could undermine the unity \nand sovereignty of the State. The political dialogue will \nalso become a historic forum for discussion of all issues \nof national concern. We are confident that we are now \ngetting closer to achieving a comprehensive and lasting \npeace.\n\nThere has been steady progress in the promotion \nand protection of human rights in my country. A \nseries of presidential amnesties have been granted, \nwhich creates an enabling environment for everyone \nto participate in the parliament, political parties, civil \nsociety organizations and labour organizations. The \nMyanmar National Human Rights Commission, which \nwas first established in 2011, was reconstituted very \nrecently with a view to functioning as an independent \nentity. Many complaint mechanisms, including the \nCommission, have been made available to citizens so \nthat they can file complaints in the event of violation \nof their rights.\n\nIn this new era, press and media freedom is one of \nthe most visible outcomes of the reforms. In contributing \nto the all-inclusive reform process, the media is getting \nmore space now. The abolishment of decades-old press \ncensorship, the publishing of a multitude of private \nnewspapers and journals and the enactment of a new \n\nmedia law are among the significant achievements in \nour media landscape.\n\nWith firm resolve, Myanmar is now combating \nhuman trafficking, preventing gender violence and \nprotecting children. Sexual violence is a crime strongly \nabhorred in our traditional values and national culture. \nIt is strictly forbidden by law. At the global summit \nin London in June this year, Myanmar joined the \nDeclaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence \nin Conflict. Its signing of the Declaration reflects \nthe country\u2019s State policy of zero tolerance for use \nof rape or sexual violence as a weapon of war. The \nArmed Forces of Myanmar are making important \nprogress in its implementation of the action plan to \nend the recruitment of child soldiers in Myanmar. Due \nto our strong commitment, there is no new underage \nrecruitment, unwittingly or otherwise.\n\nAll major human rights concerns have been \naddressed to a larger extent in the new Myanmar than \nbefore. We have now reached the middle tier of the \nhuman rights ladder. That progress is contributing to \nthe better enjoyment of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms by the people of Myanmar. Therefore, we are \nnow fully convinced that Myanmar should no longer \nremain on the agendas of the Human Rights Council \nand the Third Committee of the General Assembly.\n\nWe are also paying great attention to and making \nefforts to address the issue of the communal violence \nthat had occurred between the two communities in \nRakhine state. The history, diversity and complexity \nof the issue must be fully understood before jumping \nto conclusions. The situation should not be looked at \nin a superficial manner. The international community \nshould contribute pragmatically and objectively to \nfinding a durable solution. In addressing the root \ncause, we are working for peace, stability, harmony \nand development for all the people in Rakhine state. \nAn action plan is being finalized and will soon be \nlaunched. Once in place, it will be implemented in a \nsystematic and timely manner.\n\nI take this opportunity to thank all international \npartners for contributing to our efforts to address the \ncurrent needs of the affected people. As development \nis one of the main challenges in Rakhine state, I \nwould also like to invite the international community, \nparticularly the United Nations, to provide much-\nneeded development assistance there.\n\nThe Government of Myanmar has been focusing on \npoverty reduction and rural development with a view \nto lifting the living standards of rural and urban people \nalike. We are striving to realize the structural changes \nfrom an agriculture-based economy to an industrial \none. As those efforts become increasingly crystallized, \nwe have been enjoying steady economic growth. We \nhave achieved a growth rate in our gross domestic \nproduct of 5.6 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 8.7 per cent in \nthe past three years, respectively.\n\nThat encouraging trend in economic growth and \noverall progress in our reform process has made us take \nan important decision. Taking this opportunity, I would \nlike to announce that Myanmar is fully determined and \nhas initiated the internal process to graduate from its \nleast developed country (LDC) status. In that regard, \nPresident U Thein Sein has communicated to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, our intention \nand determination to graduate from LDC status. A \nhigh-level national committee and subcommittees are \nactively coordinating domestic measures, including \na transition strategy, for our graduation. We are now \nworking closely with the relevant United Nations \nagencies for technical and necessary assistance.\n\nMyanmar has made tremendous progress over the \npast three and a half years, since it began wide-ranging \nreforms in transition to democracy. Myanmar\u2019s success \nin peaceful transformation was even lauded as a model \nin the world today. Despite all those achievements, \nthere remain many challenges and hurdles on our path \nto democracy and development. We are fully aware of \nthose daunting challenges. We will not be complacent. \nWe are resolute and determined to continue our \nunrelenting efforts aimed at reform and the building of \na democratic State.\n\nMyanmar is changing, and changing in the right \ndirection. We are laying a solid foundation for a \ndemocratic State in which we can live in harmony, peace \nand prosperity. Developments in Myanmar should also \nbe viewed in a more balanced and objective manner. It \nis the primary responsibility of the people of Myanmar \nto realize their long-held aspirations for democracy, \npeace and prosperity. The continued support and \nunderstanding of the international community would \ncontribute positively to Myanmar\u2019s reform process. \nRome was not built in a day."

        "file_text": "I would like \nto extend to the President, on behalf of the people and \nGovernment of Togo, as well as on my own behalf, our \nwarmest congratulations on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \nwould also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, my country\u2019s \nsincere congratulations on and encouragement for \nhis efforts to enable our Organization to meet the \nchallenges facing our world.\n\nBy giving the sixty-ninth session of the General \nAssembly the theme \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, the \nPresident wished to remind Member States of their \nresponsibility to spare no effort in defining, as we \nlook ahead in the context of the post-2015 period, a \ndevelopment agenda commensurate with the challenges \nfacing the world. Indeed, it is undeniable that defining \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been \nbeneficial to humankind. While not all of those goals \nwill be achieved by all our States, our commitment to \nworking together to attain them has enabled us to make \nnotable progress towards each of the Goals throughout \nthe world. The new development agenda should therefore \nprovide States with an appropriate road map that takes \ninto account the diversity and complexity of situations \nand developments resulting from the experience gained \nin implementing the MDGs.\n\nFor its part, the Togolese Government remains \ndetermined and mobilized to continue and to scale up \nthe necessary efforts in the context of a new post-2015 \ndevelopment programme with a view to a more tangible \nreduction in the level of poverty in our country. In recent \nyears, the incidence of poverty has in fact been reduced \nby three points in Togo. That trend is supported by an \nimprovement in the business climate that provides good \nprospects for increasing the success of the job creation \nprogrammes being implemented in the country for the \nbenefit of young people.\n\nIn that regard, we note, among other elements, the \npositive impact as a result of conducting several job \ncreation and grass-roots development programmes. In \nthe same spirit, we have established the National Fund \nfor Inclusive Finance, whose goal is to make financial \nservices accessible to the most vulnerable people, in \nparticular women, who are generally excluded from \naccess to credit from traditional financial institutions.\n\nIn the field of agriculture, Togo continues to \ndevelop the National Agricultural Investment and Food \nSecurity Programme. Its implementation has led not \nonly to satisfactory results in the context of food self-\nsufficiency but also to agricultural surpluses for several \ncrop years, particularly that of 2013/14.\n\nIn terms of health, encouraging results have been \nachieved in reducing the maternal and infant mortality \n\nrates and in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and \ntuberculosis.\n\nWith regard to the preservation of the environment \nand improvement in living conditions, robust actions \nhave significantly increased the level of access to \nsanitation and clean water. Moreover, the Government \nhas stepped up its adaptation efforts to curb the impact \nof climate change, in particular, with regard to disasters \ncaused by economic imbalance, which undermines the \nwell-being of our citizens. Our country is actively \nstrengthening the institutional mechanism for disaster \nmanagement. Togo has increased its contribution to \nthe protection of world heritage and to international \nsecurity through significant efforts in its resolute \nfight against the trafficking of protected species, as \nevidenced by the neutralization of several networks and \nthe seizure of large quantities of ivory.\n\nThe forward-looking vision of Togo as a country \nable to ensure and take ownership of its development in \nall respects has led the Government to initiate Vision \nTogo 2030. Launched in April, that initiative is based \non a participatory approach. It should ultimately, with \nthe accelerated growth and job creation strategy, allow \nmy country to better ensure its achievement of the \nMDGs and the post-2015 development agenda, which \nwe wholeheartedly desire. I would like to thank the \nentire United Nations system and all the countries that \nhave helped us to achieve the progress made.\n\nThe situation of chronic instability prevailing in \nAfrica today, in particular in the Sahel-Sahara region, \nis of concern. With its experience as a non-permanent \nmember of the Security Council, on which it served \nin 2012 and 2013, my country, Togo, is now more \ncertain than ever that our agenda for peace and the new \narchitecture for international security must reflect the \nnew situation of the regionalization of conflicts.\n\nUnfortunately, another factor that further threatens \nthe survival of States and their development efforts is \nterrorism. In Africa, for example, Boko Haram and \nAl-Shabaab frequently carry out acts that destabilize \nbrother countries, such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Somalia \nand Kenya. Nevertheless, my country welcomes the joint \nefforts of the international community, which helped \nto thwart the armed terrorist groups, in particular in \nSomalia and Mali. We truly appreciate the efforts of \nthe French Government to remain engaged in the Sahel \nregion so as to continue the fight against terrorists \nalongside African countries in Operation Barkhane. \nHowever, it is important that such efforts continue and \nstrengthen and that the international community spare \nno effort in supporting the affected African countries, \njust as it has mobilized to counter the spread of terrorism \nin Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the world.\n\nBeyond the effective control of borders, in vast \ngeographical areas such as the Sahel, which in recent \nyears has mobilized the international community to fight \nagainst terrorism, it is, in our view, equally essential to \nfurther secure our coasts in order to eradicate, with the \nsame determination, maritime piracy.\n\nIn that spirit, mindful of the stakes involved, Togo \ntook the initiative to host an international conference \non maritime security and economic development \nin Africa in Lom\u00e9 in 2015 under the auspices of the \nAfrican Union. Togo seeks to play a leading role in \nproviding, with the support of all like-minded partners, \na framework to implement measures that have been \nrecommended on various occasions to make the \nAfrican coast a key space for international trade, free \nof organized predators, who instil fear along our coasts.\n\nWith regard to the promotion of peace, stability and \nsecurity in our countries, the deteriorating situation \nin the Central African Republic, Libya, South Sudan, \nSyria, Palestine, Ukraine and elsewhere in the world \nis of the gravest concern to us owing to the harmful \nconsequences. Such repercussions are likely to call into \nquestion the very existence of those countries and to \ndestroy their precious development efforts.\n\nMy country, Togo, has recovered stability. It is \nmoving forward towards a new horizon with renewed \nconfidence. The daughters and sons of Togo have now \nchosen to build the future in a climate of peace and \nnational harmony. Election after election, Togolese \ndemocracy is being built and strengthened through \ndialogue and consultation. It is being established with \nfunctioning institutions, with the support and vigilance \nof a determined civil society and all citizens, who are \nmore aware than ever of the remaining challenges to \novercome in terms of democracy.\n\nThe plan for our society, which is mobilizing Togo, \nseeks above all to make the country an active and \nresponsible member of the international community, \ndetermined to work hand in hand with other nations, \nso as to systematically thwart the conduits of tension, \nbreak the cycle of violence everywhere and prevent \nentrenched insecurity. Those are prerequisites not only \nfor social peace but also for economic development.\n\nI cannot conclude my statement without reminding \nthe Assembly of the great peril to human survival \nthreatening the entire African continent, and West \nAfrica in particular, with the outbreak of the Ebola \nvirus. In that regard, I would like to welcome the \nSecurity Council\u2019s adoption of resolution 2177 (2014), \nwhich describes the disease as a threat to international \npeace and security.\n\nRecognizing the importance of human capital in \ndevelopment work, my country welcomes efforts by \nmultilateral and bilateral actors to stem the epidemic. \nWe launch an urgent appeal to the bodies of the United \nNations system and to States to be more concerned \nabout the fate of our populations, in particular, those \nin Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, by supporting our \nefforts to save the infected and prevent the spread of the \ndisease, which knows no boundaries.\n\nI hope that the common values that we share and \naffirm resonate well beyond the confines of diplomatic \nnegotiations and that daily find direct and clear \nexpression in places where peace, security and shared \nprosperity are tangibly enjoyed.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I bring to the \nAssembly fraternal greetings and best wishes from \nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of \nSierra Leone, and his beleaguered people. President \nKoroma deeply regrets that, for obvious reasons, he is \nunable to participate in the sixty-ninth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. He has, however, instructed me to \ndeliver to the Assembly this message from him:\n\n\u201cI congratulate the President on being elected \nto conduct the affairs of the sixty-ninth session of \nthe Assembly and assure him of the support and \ncooperation of my country, Sierra Leone, during \nhis tenure. To his predecessor, Ambassador John \nAshe of Antigua and Barbuda, let me, on behalf \nof my Government and people, express our \nappreciation for his astute leadership and skill in \nsmoothly directing the work of the past session of \nthe General Assembly.\n\u201cMy sincere thanks and appreciation go to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his constructive \nand dynamic leadership of the Organization. Sierra \nLeone deeply appreciates his forward-looking and \nlaudable initiatives on the issues of sustainable \nenergy and climate change, among others. In \nparticular, I appreciate his robust response to the \nEbola epidemic that is causing so much havoc in \nour lives and threatening our dignity and our very \nexistence. We will continue to support those highly \nambitious and commendable initiatives for a better \nand safer world.\n\u201cSierra Leone commends the President on \nthe choice, appropriateness and sense of urgency \nof the theme of the sixty-ninth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, and we join him in calling \nfor a structured dialogue, strengthened global \npartnership and enhanced cooperation for its \nachievement. Sierra Leone wishes to reiterate the \nneed to generate the required global political will \nto address unfinished business in the context of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by \nfocusing on implementation gaps and new and \nemerging challenges. As Chair of the small Group \nof Seven Plus States, Sierra Leone reaffirms the \ncall of this group of fragile and post-conflict States \nfor the support of goal 16 of the outcome document \nof the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. Goal 16 is one of 17 priorities \nof the post-2015 development agenda and envisages \npromoting peaceful and inclusive institutions as a \nstand-alone aim.\n\u201cMy country is battling one of the biggest life-or-\ndeath challenges facing the global community. As \nI stated in my address to the Secretary-General\u2019s \nhigh-level meeting on response to the Ebola virus \ndisease outbreak, Ebola is unlike previous threats, \nnot because something similar has never occurred \nbefore, but because the Ebola outbreak has mutated \ninto a phenomenon for which my country, my \nregion and the global community were grossly ill-\nprepared. Isolated communities are becoming less \nfrequent in our globalized world. Mutating viral \ndiseases like Ebola can no longer be neatly isolated \nsimply by sealing off a country in a corner of the \nworld. The Ebola outbreak in our region provides \nthe first challenge to infrastructure, human capital \nand public health and surveillance systems that \nare too weak to deal with the faster occurrences \nof animal-to-human, and human-to-human \ntransmissions of highly contagious diseases that \nhave been made possible by quicker transportation, \nincreasing urbanization and dense networks of \npeople moving between rural and urban areas and \nacross borders.\n\u201cWe have been slow to meet this new challenge \nbecause no one recognized that this confluence of \ntrends could emerge with such virulence in West \nAfrica. Our international partners were slow to \nrecognize the threat for what it was, and when \nrecognition did come, it was accompanied by a \nspontaneous reaction of fear and panic that led to \nthe closure of borders and the imposition of travel \nrestrictions to and from Sierra Leone and our \nsubregion.\n\u201cThis is the very first time Ebola has come to \nour region and to my country, Sierra Leone. We \ndid not bring it on ourselves. We are rebuilding \nour infrastructure, implementing policies that \nwere increasing our growth rates, improving our \nhealth-care and literacy indicators, enhancing \nour peace, and strengthening our democracy. \nWe are contributing troops to the United Nations \npeacekeeping operations in other lands, as our share \nof the peace dividend. The world was lauding us for \ndoing so many things right, for being a symbol of \n\nfast-paced recovery from a decade-long devastating \ncivil conflict, for promoting and protecting human \nrights, and for advancing along an impressive path \nof socioeconomic reconstruction. We were gearing \nup our health-care system to fight the known \nailments of our land, such as malaria, maternal \nand infant mortality, Lassa fever, tuberculosis \nand typhoid, when Ebola struck. Based on the \nknowledge we had, based on the advice we were \ngiven by our international partners, we mobilized \nto meet this unfamiliar threat. But the staff, \nequipment, medicines and systems we had were \ninadequate, and this slowed our effective response.\n\u201cSeveral months down the road, the \ninternational community has finally come around \nto the view that the Ebola outbreak is a challenge \nfor everyone, and that, while Sierra Leone and its \nsister republics are at the front line of this fight, \nthe heavy aerial and ground support of the world \nare required to defeat the outbreak, for Ebola is \nin many ways worse than terrorism. As a country, \nwe have taken extraordinary measures, including \ndeclaring a state of emergency and shutting down \nthe country for three days to get health educators \ninto every household in the country. Today, most of \nour people know that Ebola may present with the \nsame signs as malaria, typhoid, diarrhoea and other \ninfectious diseases, but that it is far more deadly, \nand that there is a need to modify behaviour in \norder to counter its transmission.\n\u201cSocioeconomic disruptions are already being \nfelt. We are no longer able to engage in our cultural \npractices, such as shaking hands when we gladly \nreceive each other, or hold religious and communal \nburial ceremonies. Our people live in fear and \ncannot understand the nature of a disease that \nclaims lives and prevents family members from \nburying their loved ones.\n\u201cThe indeterminate suspension of several \nongoing development projects, and the disruption \nto farming, mining, manufacturing, construction, \ntourism, trading and public transportation, following \nthe outbreak of Ebola, are now undermining the \ngrowth and human development prospects of the \ncountry. The International Monetary Fund has \nestimated that our gross domestic product will \ndrop by 3.3 per cent in 2014 from 11.3 per cent to \n8 per cent. Ebola has placed a stranglehold on the \nsocioeconomic prospects of the country, and, in \naddition, we risk reversing the hard gains achieved \nin peacebuilding.\n\u201cWe salute the great efforts of countries, as \nwell as international and national organizations, \nthat have committed resources to our common \nfight. We welcome the adoption of the landmark \nSecurity Council resolution 2177 (2014) and its \nGeneral Assembly counterpart, resolution 69/1, \nboth of which recognize the Ebola outbreak as a \nthreat to international peace and security. We \nalso salute the Secretary-General for his initiative \nin establishing the first-ever United Nations \nemergency health mission, the United Nations \nMission for Ebola Emergency Response, to lead \na concerted and coordinated effort to contain and \ndefeat this scourge within the subregion.\n\u201cWe know that to defeat the disease and \nprevent future outbreaks anywhere in the world, we \nmust improve our capacities for quicker response. \nIn Sierra Leone, this calls for faster deployment of \nstaff, medicines and equipment at the global and \nnational levels. Globally, a faster response means \nquickening the pace of resource mobilization \nand disbursements, as well as the development of \nvaccines and curative medicines. Nationally, our \neffort must rapidly translate into effective urban \nand rural community response initiatives. Any \nbreak in this chain of fast response makes the \nchallenge more difficult to meet, and not meeting \nthe challenge means more deaths in our country and \nthe increased possibility that the virus will mutate \nand spread to areas from which it is currently \nabsent.\n\u201cThe world needs a faster global response \ninfrastructure to deal with this new trend that \nis today manifesting itself in the West African \nnations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but to \nwhich no country can be immune. Ebola is winning \nthe race against us. To make an impactful start in \nreversing this trend, we must have more treatment \nbeds than there are Ebola cases. Only when the \nnumber of available beds surpasses the number of \ncases can we say that Ebola has been brought under \ncontrol. This is a fight for all of us. We must prove \nthat humankind is equal to overcoming this new \nchallenge to our collective existence.\n\u201cWe also believe that it is high time for this \nAssembly to make its voice heard regarding the \nflight bans and cancellations that have accompanied \n\nthe deadly Ebola outbreak. The World Health \nOrganization and many others have advised against \nimposing blanket flight bans. We therefore urge \nMember States to re-examine their policies of \nisolating and stigmatizing Ebola-affected countries \nand their respective citizens. The world is too \nglobalized for policies that shun engagement with a \ndemocratic nation. The United Nations was founded \non a mandate to confront human insecurity, not \nshun it. Moreover, this Organization was founded \non the principle of doing better than before. We \nstrongly urge loyalty to the founding ideals of our \nglobal Organization.\n\u201cDespite the daunting challenge facing us as \na nation and subregion, Sierra Leone will remain \na trusted and strategic partner in the global effort \nto eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable \npeace, stability and development. My Government \nis committed to forging closer bonds with all \ncountries, especially within the context of the New \nDeal for Engagement in Fragile States.\n\u201cAs Coordinator of the African Union \nCommittee of Ten Heads of State on the Reform of \nthe United Nations, we will continue to advance the \nAfrican Common Position on the reform process of \nthe United Nations by reaching out and engaging \nwith other interest groups in a bid to reach a common \nunderstanding of how to obtain a strong, inclusive, \nunited, transparent and accountable Security \nCouncil. While the world now acknowledges the \nhistorical injustice represented by the fact that \nAfrica is the only continent not represented in \nthe permanent category of Council membership \nand, at the same time, is underrepresented in the \nnon-permanent category, it is about time for this \nOrganization to take the necessary bold steps to put \ninto practice our reaffirmation of the equal rights \nof nations, large and small. Indeed, as we gear up \nto celebrate 70 memorable years of the existence \nof the United Nations, it is an appropriate time \nfor the Organization to promote the principle of \nthe sovereign equality of all its Members and to \nensure for all the rights and benefits resulting from \nmembership.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the progress made in \nstrengthening peace and democracy within member \ncountries of the Mano River Union, and we shall \ncontinue to support initiatives for the sustenance \nand growth of democratic order, peace and security \nin the subregion. We will continue to adhere to \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS) protocols for peace, democracy and \nstability and will sustain our support for the \nbuilding of the ECOWAS logistical depot in Sierra \nLeone. We firmly support the African Union \nrapid intervention initiative for peacekeeping and \npeace-support operations. We have also ratified \nthe Arms Trade Treaty and the Convention against \nTransnational Organized Crime and the Protocols \nthereto. We are currently working to incorporate \nthem into our domestic law.\n\u201cMy Government will continue to contribute \ntroops and support international peacekeeping \noperations for international peace and security, and \nwe will accordingly seek capacity-building and \nother support in such laudable ventures. We are, \nhowever, dismayed by the current trend of events \nin South Sudan, the Central African Republic, the \nGaza Strip, Syria, Ukraine, Iraq and other parts of \nthe world that are still in conflict. We will commit \nSierra Leone to the global search for common \nagreement on the root causes of those conflicts \nand encourage dialogue to work out resolutions \nthat are peaceful and sustainable. We support the \ntwo independent States solution in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict.\n\u201cSierra Leone condemns any act of terrorism \nin all its forms and manifestations in the world \nin general and in Africa in particular. Terrorism \nis a common enemy to international peace and \nsecurity. Sierra Leone prides itself on its high level \nof religious tolerance, and we believe that people of \nall religions and ethnic backgrounds must be able \nto coexist in peace and harmony everywhere in the \nworld. We likewise view acts of drug trafficking, \nhuman trafficking, smuggling of migrants, \nmarine piracy, cybercrime, abductions and all \nother organized or unorganized transnational \ncriminal activities as serious threats to global \npeace, stability and development. My Government \nwill strengthen national capacities and contribute \nthrough international cooperation to preventing \nand combating those crimes.\n\u201cAs a post-conflict country, we are aware \nthat sexual violence in conflict is one of the \ngreatest and most persistent injustices in the world \ntoday. We are therefore supportive of the United \nKingdom\u2019s Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative \n\nand the subsequent Declaration of Commitment to \nEnd Sexual Violence in Conflict. We support the \nwork of the Office of the Special Representative \nof the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence \nin Conflict. We also fully support the United \nKingdom Government\u2019s leadership in promoting \nglobal advocacy against the use of children in \narmed conflicts.\n\u201cWe are following the unfolding developments at \nthe International Criminal Court and are supportive \nof the efforts to ensure judicial accountability in \nways that are respectful of Africa\u2019s concerns for \nthe ability of its statesmen and stateswomen to \nsteer the countries of the continent towards greater \nsecurity, reconciliation, peace and development.\n\u201cMy Government will continue to support \nthe work of the Human Rights Council. We are \ncommitted to the moratorium on the death penalty \nand have gone a step further in the process of \ncommuting capital offences to life imprisonment in \nour statute books.\n\u201cIn conclusion, while applauding the \ninternational community for supporting our \naspirations, we wish to remind the world that \nfighting the Ebola virus disease in West Africa \nis a matter of life and death for the whole of \nhumankind. The World Health Organization \nfinally got it right when it declared the outbreak \nas a global health emergency, but an emergency \nrequires a response faster than what is currently \nobtaining. We can defeat Ebola and, as already \nnoted by experts, future outbreaks of diseases \nof that nature anywhere in the world can also be \ndefeated by quickening the pace of response. Our \nunderstanding of that unprecedented outbreak is \nbetter now than at the beginning, and our response \nhas improved accordingly. While our capacities are \ngetting better coordinated, there is still room for \nstrengthening those capacities to ensure effective \nnational ownership and leadership of all response \nmechanisms. Undoubtedly, we can do better than \nwhat obtained at the beginning of the outbreak, and \nwe must do all we can to end such a grave threat \nto our collective survival. We will also continue \nour engagement with all stakeholders to build our \npublic health system beyond Ebola.\n\u201cOn the occasion of the sixty-ninth session of \nthe General Assembly, let me reiterate our deepest \ncondolences to the families and relatives of all our \nbrave men, women and children who have lost their \nlives to the Ebola virus disease. May the Father \nmost high receive their souls and the souls of all \nfaithful departed into his merciful hands.\u201d\n"

I would also like to thank Mr. John \nAshe for his work during his presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. Our appreciation \nalso goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nannual report on the work of the Organization (A/69/1).\n\nWe meet today on the eve of the seventieth \nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations, to \nwhich my country had the honour to contribute. That \nmilestone reminds us of the need to draw lessons and \nexplore the best ways to put an end to war and violence \nand to mobilize international efforts to combat terrorism \nand terrorists.\n\nI wish to convey the concerns of my country, \nLebanon, which is at the crossroads of a turbulent \nregion. Today Lebanon is the target of a fierce terrorist \nonslaught being perpetrated by obscurantist and criminal \ngroups. They have attacked many parts of Lebanon and \ncaused the loss of military and civilian lives, as well \nas considerable material damage. Last month, terrorists \nkidnapped a number of soldiers and security officers. \nThey took them hostage in order to bring pressure to \nbear on and to blackmail the Lebanese authorities. They \nbrutally executed three of the detainees. Such crimes \nhave impeded the ongoing indirect negotiations that \nmy Government was conducting with the assistance of \nfriendly countries to secure the release of the soldiers. \nI would like to underscore that compromise on our \nfirm beliefs is not an option. We remain focused on the \nrelease of our soldiers, while preserving the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and security of our country.\n\n\nIn combating terrorism, the Lebanese people stand \nunited with its armed forces, which represent the main \npillar on which we depend to safeguard our national \nsovereignty, security and peace. Our Government \ncontinues to rally the necessary support for its forces \nto be able to fulfil their duty. In that regard, Lebanon \nvalues the generous donation of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia to support our armed forces. We also pay \ntribute to the initiative of the Secretary-General, who \nlaunched the International Support Group for Lebanon \nlast September here in New York city. We express our \nsatisfaction and reassurance over the outcomes of the \nmeetings held by the Support Group this year in Paris \nand Rome.\n\nThe current international mobilization against \nterror reflects the international community\u2019s awareness \nof the alarming situation in our region and the need \nto extinguish the flames of violence and prevent the \nspread of such attacks. Lebanon underscores the \nneed for regional and international cooperation to \nfight terrorism. We welcome the Security Council \nresolutions on the subject, in particular resolutions 2170 \n(2014) and 2178 (2014). Lebanon calls on its brothers \nand friends around the world to safeguard and protect it \nfrom regional power struggles.\n\nOur fight against terrorism is not new. For years, \nLebanon has suffered under the threat posed by political \ncrimes, which have targeted many of its leaders, in \nparticular former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and \nprominent media figures and intellectuals. We continue \nto follow the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. \nWe look forward to the establishment of the truth in \norder to put an end to impunity, enable justice to be \nserved and deter criminals.\n\nThe events unfolding in vast areas of Syria and Iraq \nconstitute human crimes that cannot be understood \nor accepted by any intellect or faith. Perpetrated in \nthe name of Islam, such crimes have cost the lives of \ntens of thousands of Muslim civilians and have caused \nunprecedented waves of displaced people. In addition, \nthose crimes have destabilized national entities, divided \nsocieties and destroyed human and material resources. \n\nThat terrorist onslaught targets religious groups \nthat since time immemorial have been an essential \ncomponent of the social fabric of the region and a \nfundamental part of the social and cultural diversity \nthat has long characterized the eastern Mediterranean. \nIn the past few months, the entire world has witnessed \nattacks against Christians and Yazidis in Iraq, their \nforced expulsion and the destruction of their property \nand holy sites. Lebanon considers attacks against \nreligions, their followers and sacred places to be an \noffence against human dignity and a violation of the \nfreedom of religious belief and practice enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the International \nBill of Human Rights, respect for which is guaranteed \nby our Lebanese Constitution.\n\nLebanon is proud to be the only country in the \nArab and Islamic worlds where the President of the \nRepublic is a Christian citizen. That confirms that our \ncountry, despite its political crises, has been a paragon \nof diversity in the Middle East, an exceptional example \nof coexistence and interaction among followers of \ndifferent religions and sects and a model totally opposed \nto the notion of a racist State. I take this opportunity \nto reiterate before the General Assembly the Lebanese \nGovernment\u2019s call for the election of a new Christian \nPresident of the Republic as soon as possible.\n\nThe painful and worrisome war in Syria, which \nhas continued for more than four years, has driven \nnearly 1.5 million displaced Syrians to Lebanon \u2014 a \nnumber that is equivalent to one-third of the Lebanese \npopulation. In order to fully understand the dimensions \nof that situation, one would have to imagine 100 million \npeople flooding into the United States of America \nand spreading out randomly through its cities, towns, \nschools and parks, with their related urgent needs \nand requirements, posing an unbearable burden at the \neconomic, humanitarian, social, educational, health \nand security levels.\n\nThat huge number of displaced people weighs \nheavily on the Lebanese infrastructure, which already \nhas structural problems. It puts pressure on the national \neconomy, where growth has dropped to almost 0 per \ncent owing to the regional situation, which represents \na loss of $7.5 billion for Lebanon, according to World \nBank estimates. This reality constitutes a national \ndisaster for us. The problem of the displaced Syrians, \nwith all its serious economic, social and security \nimplications, is not \u2014 and should not be \u2014 a purely \nLebanese problem. It is a major regional crisis that we \nput before the international community, which must \nshare that enormous burden with Lebanon. Such a \nburden cannot be borne by any country alone, no matter \nhow large.\n\nLebanon reiterates its concern for the unity, \nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of \nSyria. In our Government policy statement, we have \n\n\nreaffirmed our commitment to the policy of keeping \nour distance in order to protect ourselves from the \nrepercussions of the crisis in the neighbouring country.\n\nOn the eighth anniversary of the adoption of Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon asserts its \ncommitment to implementing all of the resolution\u2019s \nprovisions. We believe that it will strengthen stability \nand security in southern Lebanon and contribute to \nextending the State\u2019s authority over its entire territory. \nWe renew our appeal to the international community \nto compel Israel to fulfil all its obligations in that \nregard, to stop violating Lebanese sovereignty from the \nland, the sea and the air and to fully cooperate with \nthe United Nations peacekeeping forces of the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in order to \ndemarcate what is left of the Blue Line and immediately \nwithdraw from the area north of Ghajar, the Sheba\u2019a \nFarms and the Kfar Shouba Hills.\n\nWe also wish to reaffirm Lebanon\u2019s full rights to its \nterritorial waters and the natural oil and gas resources \nwithin its exclusive economic zone. Lebanon cannot \nfail to acknowledge the role of UNIFIL and the ongoing \ncooperation and coordination between UNIFIL and \nthe Lebanese army. Lebanon would like to thank all \nnations that contribute to the Force, the Force leaders \nand the members of the Force for their dedication in \nthe service of the stability and security of civilians in \nsouthern Lebanon.\n\nLast month, the Gaza Strip was subjected to a new \nIsraeli aggression, which killed hundreds of civilians, \ndisplaced more than a quarter of the population and \ndestroyed homes, hospitals and infrastructure. Lebanon, \nwhich has paid dearly as a result of the repeated Israeli \nattacks, calls for legal accountability for the war crimes \ncommitted by Israel and for that country to be held \naccountable for its actions in order to prevent impunity.\n\nLebanon believes that Israel is responsible for \nfrustrating all efforts to reach a peaceful settlement \nbased on the two-State solution. It stresses the need \nfor a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the \nconflict in the Middle East, based on Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the Madrid terms \nof reference for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative, \nadopted at the Beirut summit in 2002.\n\nToday, the Levant seems to be the stage for \ndark and arbitrary tragedies, where the most recent \nmanifestations of human savagery are being played out. \nToday, the Levant seems to be hostage to ignorance, \nextremism and obscurantism, plunged into a hatred \narising from a distant past and guided by a fanaticism \nand instincts that yield only bloodshed. However, that \ntroubled area was, is and will be home to many people \nwho, like all other human beings, have land, homes, \ntales, dreams and a history. They are individuals who \nare eager to live as free and equal citizens in free and \nstable countries. They have sons and daughters who \nseek better opportunities for engagement in the world \nand a better place to live.\n\nHumankind owes a debt to our Levant. We gave \nhumankind enlightenment when darkness, extremism \nand ignorance were crippling the other side of the \nworld. We still have much to offer and to add to the \ntremendous development of human progress and \ncreativity. The world must stop counting our dead. It \nmust meet its obligation and seek to establish peace in \nthat tormented part of the world \u2014 a peace that is based \non law, justice, respect for the sovereignty of nations \nand the protection of their security and territorial \nintegrity, the safeguarding of the fundamental rights \nof individuals and groups, including their right to enjoy \ntheir wealth, and the protection of religious and ethnic \ndiversity.\n\nWe, the Lebanese people, both at home and in \nevery corner of the world, look to the United Nations \nfor assistance. At the same time, we are determined to \novercome the current crisis, as we have done so many \ntimes before. We are confident that, together, we will \nnot allow any person, any circumstance or any party \nto extinguish the beacons of freedom, democracy, \ndiversity, pluralism, knowledge and human rights in \nLebanon.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-ninth session and to wish you every success \nin carrying out that important task. It is also a great \npleasure to express my gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for \nhis successful and fruitful guidance of the previous \nsession of the General Assembly.\n\nThe current situation in the world vividly \ndemonstrates that the ongoing instability, increasing \ndisputes among the leading world Powers and the absence \nof a clear and comprehensible vision for the future of the \nworld order have become part of our everyday life. War, \nconflict, a refusal to listen to one another and unilateral \naction are pushing the international community ever \ncloser to the precipice. Such developments undermine \nour efforts to work together effectively to address \ntoday\u2019s threats and challenges. It is no surprise that \nvarious terrorist and extremist groups are cunningly \ntaking advantage of the prevailing political vacuum and \nfierce opposition among world and regional Powers in \norder not only to insinuate and assert their presence, but \nalso to demonstrate their ability to directly influence \nthe situation around the world.\n\nTherefore, the role of the United Nations as a \nplatform for comprehensive dialogue is becoming ever \nmore important. Kyrgyzstan has consistently advocated \nthe further strengthening of the central coordinating \nrole of the United Nations in international affairs so \nas to maintain peace, security and stability; to promote \nshared sustainable and constructive development; and \nto encourage broad international cooperation. We \nbelieve that the ongoing and emerging sources of global \ninstability require a strengthened role for the United \nNations in every possible way. The relevance of political \nand diplomatic conflict resolution is reconfirmed by \nthe situations in Afghanistan, the Sahel, East and West \nAfrica, Ukraine and Syria. In order to overcome the \nthreats and challenges to peace, prosperity and creative \ndevelopment, we should firmly and resolutely move \nforward by uniting the efforts of the entire international \ncommunity. Kyrgyzstan expresses its full readiness \nto participate in such constructive and effective \ninternational cooperation.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of such negative global \npolitical developments, the further strengthening of \nhuman rights principles and of the rule of law, based on \nconstructive approaches and cooperation, is becoming \nall the more relevant. For Kyrgyzstan, these principles \nare an integral part of political development. The \nupcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in \nKyrgyzstan, in 2015 and 2017, will serve as an important \nstep in strengthening the democratic foundations of our \ncountry. We hope that the international community \nwill provide effective assistance to Kyrgyzstan in \nimplementing its far-reaching goals. In line with our \ncommitment to democratic principles and the desire to \nmake a further contribution to the dialogue on global \ndemocracy, Kyrgyzstan has announced its candidacy \nfor the Human Rights Council for the period of 2016-\n2018. We count on the support of members of the \nAssembly in that regard.\n\nThe world today is at a difficult juncture, marked \nby increasing regional and international instability. All \nnations, regardless of their geographical location, face \nsimilar security challenges. Our region, in this regard, \nis no exception. It is obvious that the most serious \nexternal challenge to Central Asia remains the situation \nin Afghanistan, as well as the threats of terrorism, \nextremism and drug trafficking emanating from that \ncountry.\n\nAs in the past, problems related to illegal drug-\ntrafficking as a direct consequence of the situation in \nAfghanistan are among the most severe in the entire \nregion. We are especially alarmed by the continuing \nstrong link between terrorism and illegal Afghan drugs, \nwhich undermine the achievements in Afghanistan\u2019s \nsecurity situation and its ability to ensure law and order \nthroughout the country. In this regard, it is necessary \nto pool efforts with the United Nations to promote \nsecurity and stability in Afghanistan.\n\nIn order to effectively curb these threats, we call \nfor a more proactive international contribution, in order \nto strengthen the capacity of regional law-enforcement \nagencies and to promote regional cooperation. We \nattach particular importance to the Istanbul Process \nas an important dialogue in improving regional \ncooperation on Afghan issues. We count on the active \nparticipation of all parties in achieving practical \nresults. We hope that the establishment of the new \nGovernment of Afghanistan by Mr. Ashraf Ghani and \nMr. Abdullah Abdullah will be the starting point for the \nfuture stabilization in that war-weary country.\n\nAnother important factor for regional instability \nis the unresolved border issue in Central Asia. \nUndoubtedly, a successful solution is in the best \ninterests of all States of the region. The solution would \n\ngreatly contribute to enhancing the regional transit \npotential of our countries, developing cross-border \ninfrastructure, improving the economic situation and \ndecreasing social tension. In this regard, I call on all \nCentral Asian States to support the recent initiative of \nthe President of Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Almazbek Atambaev, \non the development and subsequent signing of bilateral \nagreements on border-related confidence-building, as \nput forward at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization held in Dushanbe. I am confident that \nthe successful implementation of that initiative would \nlet us take historic steps towards the development of \nregional economic and trade relations, as well as in \njointly maintaining regional stability.\n\nAmid the turmoil sweeping through the Middle \nEast, it is especially important to focus our attention \non the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, \nwhich we view as the major destabilizing factor for the \nregion and the world. The use of force leads only to \nfurther bloodshed, destruction and hatred and does not \nsolve any problem. In order to revive mutual trust, the \nconflict must be resolved by exclusively political and \ndiplomatic means, on the basis of relevant resolutions \nof the Security Council.\n\nThe theme of the present general debate, \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d, is both timely and relevant. Next \nyear, at the seventieth anniversary session of the United \nNations, we will need to formulate and adopt new goals \nfor the following 15 years. The evolving situation today \nillustrates that many countries, including Kyrgyzstan, \nare unlikely to achieve all the objectives proposed in \nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the \nMillennium Development Goals in the next year. We \nbelieve that the goals not achieved should be refined \nin the light of gained experience and they should find \nproper reflection in the post-2015 goals for sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nWe advocate including countries with special \ndevelopment needs on the agenda of the post-2015 \nagenda. Kyrgyzstan falls into such a category. Ours \nis a developing, landlocked and mountainous State \nthat is highly vulnerable to climate change. It is well \nknown that extreme poverty in Kyrgyzstan has many \ncauses, foremost among them a disadvantageous \ngeographical location. More than 70 per cent of our \nterritory is mountainous. The country lies 5,000 \nmetres above sea level, with approximately one third \nof its total area lying 400 metres above sea level. Such \nStates are characterized by remoteness, inaccessibility, \ninformational isolation, severe geoclimatic conditions \nand a high cost of living.\n\nFor Kyrgyzstan, the absence of access to the sea \nis yet another factor having a restrictive effect on \nour economic development. Remoteness from major \ninternational transport networks and high transportation \ncosts hinder the development of multi-vector and \ndiversified international economic relations and the \nimplementation of the country\u2019s large-scale investment \nprojects. We believe that the establishment of an \ninternational development fund to provide support and \nassistance for the economies of developing landlocked \ncountries would contribute to their sustainable \neconomic development. This is especially important \nin the run-up to the second United Nations Conference \non Landlocked Developing Countries, to be held in \nVienna, where a new programme of action for the next \ndecade should be adopted.\n\nThe year 2015 will be a milestone for the entire \nworld community. In addition to the adoption of the \npost-2015 agenda, we anticipate the adoption of an \ninternational legally binding instrument on climate \nchange. On 23 September, on the margins of the \nGeneral Assembly, the United Nations Summit on \nClimate Change was held, at which States outlined \ntheir vision for a solution incorporating adaptation to \nand mitigation of climate change. For Kyrgyzstan, as \nfor all mountainous countries whose ecosystems are \nhighly sensitive to climate change, these issues are of \npriority importance on the national agenda. Abruptly \nmelting glaciers, rising temperatures, soil degradation, \nlandslides, mudflows and floods cause significant \neconomic damage and serve as vivid reminders of \nthe vulnerability of mountain ecosystems. According \nto reliable forecasts, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s ice cover could be \nreduced by 40 per cent by 2025, leading to a one third \ndrop in the water available in the region. In that regard, \nconscious of the undoubted interconnections between \nthe environment, climate change and sustainable \ndevelopment goals, we believe that it is essential that \nthe interests of vulnerable countries be adequately and \nfairly reflected in future action at the global level.\n\nSpeaking of regional problems in Central Asia, I \nshould note that dealing as we are with global challenges \nsuch as climate change, the potential threat of an \nenergy crisis and population growth, water resources \nare a key factor in prosperity, and in that regard, our \nbasic position is that the issues of water resources and \n\nenergy are indissolubly linked and inseparable from \neach other. It is crucial to understand that hydropower \ndevelopment is an essential precondition for our \nsustainable development. That is entirely consistent \nwith the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative in declaring \nthe period between 2014 and 2024 the Decade of \nSustainable Energy for All. It is clear that access to \nmodern, affordable and environmentally friendly \nenergy supplies is essential if developing countries are \nto achieve global development goals, including those \nin the Millennium Declaration. The issue of affordable \nenergy should unquestionably be appropriately \nreflected in the new world agenda of the United Nations \npost-2015.\n\nThe recovery and secure storage of uranium tailings \nin Kyrgyzstan remains a serious transboundary problem \nfor Central Asia. Most are concentrated in densely \npopulated areas, and their condition has deteriorated in \nthe last 10 years in the wake of closings of industrial \nenterprises and major production facilities. Moreover, \na large part of these tailings are at risk of exposure to \nlandslides and floods, as they are located in seismically \nactive regions near the banks of Central Asia\u2019s major \ntransboundary rivers. Despite my Government\u2019s efforts \nat the national level, along with the support of various \ninternational programmes and projects, the serious \nsocial, economic and environmental problems related \nto these issues continue. I would therefore like to urge \nthe international community to assist Kyrgyzstan \nin dealing with this problem of radioactive and toxic \nwaste through full rehabilitation of the contaminated \nareas, as envisioned in resolution 68/218, on the role of \nthe international community in averting the radiation \nthreat in Central Asia.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that no \nState can solve all the challenges it faces and maintain \nsustainable development in isolation. We cannot \nachieve our sustainable development goals and establish \nglobal order without the consolidated efforts of the \ninternational community. In that regard, I would like to \nassure the Assembly that Kyrgyzstan, in its partnership \nwith the United Nations, stands ready to contribute to \nthe search for new opportunities to solve the complex \nchallenges of our time, as well as to contribute to \nstrengthening stability and peace in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is \nan honour and a legitimate source of pride for me to \nspeak from this rostrum on behalf of my country, the \nCentral African Republic, on the occasion of the sixty-\nninth session of the General Assembly of our shared \nOrganization.\n\nI would like first to address, on behalf of the \ndelegation that is accompanying me and in my own \nname, my warm congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda, \nfor his election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. My congratulations also go \nto Mr. John Ashe, who successfully presided over the \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session, during which the \nsituation in my country was widely debated and was \nsubject to numerous resolutions of the Security Council.\n\nI would especially like to express all my gratitude \nand that of the people of the Central African Republic \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dynamism \nand commitment to my country, a commitment that was \nembodied in his April visit to Bangui.\n\nIt is also especially important for me to solemnly \naddress members in this Hall to express the profound \ngratitude of the Central African people for the \ninternational community\u2019s unwavering and tireless \ncommitment to my country in distress. That recognition \ngoes especially to the Heads of State of the Economic \nand Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC), \n\n\nthe Economic Community of Central African States \n(ECCAS), the African Union, European Union, and \nthe countries of the International Mediation under \nthe leadership of President Denis Sassou Nguesso of \nthe Republic of the Congo. It also extends to France \nand its President for their dogged determination, and \nto the United States of America and members of the \nInternational Contact Group on the Central African \nRepublic for their renewed and unflagging support for \nthe transition authorities in my country.\n\nThe sixty-ninth session is being held at a time \nwhen my country is still experiencing a worrying \nhumanitarian, security and economic situation that \nchallenges all of us as members of the international \ncommunity. The political instability and internal \nconflicts that have been recurring for more than two \ndecades have plunged the Central African Republic into \na situation of extreme vulnerability. Since December \n2012, the Central African Republic has been shaken by \none of the worst crises in its history, which has left the \nCentral African people in a dramatic situation.\n\nFollowing the resignation of my predecessor on \n10 January, I responded to the distressed calls of the \npeople of the Central African Republic. My election has \nraised great hopes among the people of my country, who \nwelcomed the election of the first woman President of \nthe Central African Republic as a sign of a break with \nthe past and the start of a new future. Since then I have \nfelt the weight of the responsibility that has befallen me \nand taken stock of the situation that I had inherited.\n\nWith determination, I immediately embarked \nupon dealing with the situation, with the support \nof the international community, in accordance with \nthe road map for the transition, whose main axes are \nthe restoration of security and peace, the resolution \nof the serious humanitarian crisis, the recovery of \nState authority throughout the national territory, the \nrelaunching of economic activities, and, of course, the \nholding of free, transparent and democratic elections. \nToday, I rejoice that my calls to the international \ncommunity to support the efforts of the transition \nhave not remained unanswered; we have been offered \nmultifaceted support, thanks to which the worst was \navoided in my country.\n\nThose combined efforts have resulted in noticeable \nprogress on security issues and humanitarian, \neconomic and political matters. In terms of security, I \nwelcome the Security Council\u2019s adoption of resolution \n2149 (2014) on 10 April, authorizing the deployment \nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic \n(MINUSCA), which was a strong response on the part \nof the international community to the Central African \ncrisis and which led, on 15 September, to the final \ntransfer of authority from the African-led International \nSupport Mission in the Central African Republic to \nMINUSCA. I want to thank all States that have made \ntheir troops, materiel and financial contributions \navailable to the Mission.\n\nWe have placed high hopes in the deployment of \nthe Mission, which should contribute effectively and \nefficiently to securing the country\u2019s path to peace and \nsustainable development. The fact remains, however, \nthat the success of the Mission will also depend on the \nclose involvement of the national security and defence \nforces, which can provide support to the Mission based \non their knowledge of the terrain.\n\nI would ask the Sanctions Committee to show \ngreat understanding and to reconsider the arms \nembargo imposed on the Central African Republic. \nAt the same time, it is also urgent to go beyond the \nBrazzaville forum, which resulted in the signing of \nan agreement to cease hostilities and opened the way \nfor the disarmament of all armed groups, the reform \nof the defence and security sectors, and especially the \nimplementation of the disarmament, demobilization \nand reintegration programme. In those areas, too, we \nwill need substantial backing from the international \ncommunity.\n\nIn the humanitarian field, efforts have been \nongoing since January. To date, the number of internally \ndisplaced persons has dropped from 900,000 to 175,000 \npeople, which means that 81 per cent of the internally \ndisplaced persons have left makeshift sites to return \nto their communities. Despite the improvements, the \nhumanitarian situation remains worrying in general, \nsince it is dependent on the fragile security situation, \nparticularly in the countryside.\n\nEfforts should be focused on the return of 400,000 \nrefugees now in neighbouring countries. Similarly, the \nresources mobilized so far cover only 48 per cent of \nthe expressed humanitarian need. In that respect, we \nexpect other disbursements to support the return of \ndisplaced and exiled persons to their homes.\n\nWith regard to the economy, the Central African \nRepublic\u2019s economy has been hit hard by the deep \ncrisis. As a result, the growth rate of the country fell \n\n\nto minus 36 per cent in 2013, placing the country in \nsudden deep recession. Thanks to active diplomacy, the \nCentral African Republic has benefited from emergency \nbudgetary support for CEMAC and ECCAS countries, \nan agreement signed with the International Monetary \nFund for the conclusion of a programme for the rapid \ndisbursement of credits and budgetary support from \nthe World Bank, the African Development Bank and \nthe European Union, as well as agreements signed with \nFrance for budget support. Beyond the announcements \nthat have been made, the effective disbursement \nof those funds will boost our country\u2019s economic \nactivities and set it on a path of growth. The emergency \nplan for sustainable reconstruction was designed to \neffectively respond to the economic crisis, and one of \nour expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the international community \nis that we should be given all the necessary support for \nthe effective implementation of that plan.\n\nIn order to promote political dialogue and national \nreconciliation and help Central Africans to live better \nwith one another, I have always focused on pacifying \nhearts and minds so as to achieve genuine national \nreconciliation. The first step was taken in Brazzaville \non 23 July. It is now time to continue the process in \nthe Central African Republic itself, by providing our \npeople with an opportunity to assess the situation of the \ncountry themselves and share their vision for the future \nof the country, and by bringing together all the parties \nto the crisis around a table to consider a new republican \npact to recast the Central African State. The Central \nAfrican Republic cherishes the ardent wish that special \nattention will be given to the political process, whose \nsuccess will depend on the resources available for its \nimplementation.\n\nI would like to commend the relevance of the \ntheme that was chosen for this session of the General \nAssembly. That theme should lead us to take stock \nof the achievements of the Millennium Development \nGoals and of emerging challenges. It comes at the right \ntime, because our world continues to be shaken by \ncrises of all types in Africa, the Middle and Near East, \nAsia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. The Ebola \nvirus disease, which is raging throughout the West \nAfrican region with the risk of expanding beyond the \nregion, is another current challenge that has large-scale, \nadverse economic and humanitarian consequences in \nmany countries. I would like to take this opportunity \nto extend, from this high rostrum, my most heartfelt \ncondolences and those of the people of the Central \nAfrican Republic to our brotherly countries in Africa \naffected by that scourge, which has claimed so many \nlives.\n\nI also extend my condolences and those of the \nCentral African people to French President Fran\u00e7ois \nHollande and the French people for the dastardly \nmurder of Herv\u00e9 Gourdel, which has upset us all. That \ncowardly murder is a timely reminder of the need to \nstep up our fight against terrorism, which remains a \nmajor threat to our planet and a real obstacle to the \npromotion of international peace and security. The \nCentral African Republic calls for greater mobilization \nby the international community against terrorism, and \nin particular against the Boko Haram sect operating \nin Nigeria and Cameroon, not far from the borders of \nmy country and against the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, \nwhich continues to rage throughout the territory of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and some \nneighbouring countries.\n\nSimilarly, the Central African Republic opposes the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, which \ncontinue to be traded illicitly and continue to fuel the \nworst conflicts throughout the world, particularly in \nAfrica. The Central African Republic welcomes the \nefforts undertaken to achieve the signing of the Arms \nTrade Treaty and the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 2117 (2013) on the non-proliferation of \nsmall arms and light weapons, and we are awaiting the \neffective implementation of that resolution.\n\nRelated to situations of war is the issue of justice \nand human rights. I am strongly committed to fighting \nimpunity. The Central African Republic, as a party to \nthe Rome Statute, will continue to support the actions \nof the International Criminal Court in its fight against \nimpunity for the most serious crimes, which affect the \nentire international community, and especially my \ncountry. In that context, the Central African Republic \nsupports the initiative taken by France and Mexico \nto cut back on the abusive use of the right of veto in \nthe Security Council in cases involving massacres of \ncivilian populations, war crimes and genocide.\n\nMy country had been committed to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, and to that end has \ndeveloped a poverty-reduction strategy paper that has \nbeen implemented with tangible results, including in \nthe areas of water, sanitation and education. That was \nthe case until the most recent crisis unfortunately came \nabout, which called everything into question. I should \nalso like to draw the attention of the international \ncommunity to landlocked States like mine and to call \n\n\nfor international solidarity to ensure that substantial \nassistance be granted to them in order to ease the \nburden associated with our economic vulnerability and \nfacilitate the implementation of the Almaty Programme \nof Action.\n\nI commend the efforts undertaken by the \ninternational community to stem climate change and its \nnegative impact on the world. I strongly encourage all \ncountries to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto \nProtocol and to incorporate the principles of the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \ninto the new agreement to be adopted at Paris in 2015.\n\nThe Central African Republic is against any and \nall attempts in favour of partition and threats against \nthe territorial integrity of nations. As such, it supports \nthe position of the Kingdom of Morocco on the Sahara \nissue, which is in accordance with Security Council \nresolutions 1754 (2007) and 2152 (2014).\n\nI cannot conclude without paying a heartfelt tribute \nto the work of the United Nations to promote peace \nthroughout the world. In conclusion, I would like to \nexpress, above all, my pride at the courage and great \nresilience of the Central African people and their \ndetermination to rise up from the recurrent crises that \nhave inflicted untold suffering on them. Long live the \nUnited Nations! Long live international solidarity to \nensure that peace and security prevails throughout the \nworld!\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly \ncongratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I also congratulate Ambassador John Ashe \nfor his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. My appreciation also goes to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his stewardship of our endeavours to \nrealize our common vision of a world of peace, dignity \nand well-being for all.\n\nFour decades ago, in his maiden speech before \nthe General Assembly, the Father of our nation of \nBangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman \n(see A/PV.2243), described his vision for a global \norder, saying that the Bengali nation is pledge-bound \nto establish a global order, one based on peaceful \ncoexistence, social justice and freedom from poverty, \nhunger, exploitation and aggression. That vision \ncontinues to guide Bangladesh\u2019s national development \npolicies and our engagement in global affairs.\n\nWe gather at a time when the global development \ndiscourse finds itself at an important juncture. As the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) approaches its deadline, the global community \nis engaged in framing a transformative development \nagenda for 2016-2030. The theme for this session of the \nGeneral Assembly is therefore quite timely. Bangladesh \nbelieves that our deliberations will help us to arrive at a \nbalanced, pragmatic and ambitious agenda.\n\nWe cannot achieve sustainable development in the \nabsence of durable peace and security. The volatile \nglobal security situation continues to pose significant \nchallenges to international development. Bangladesh \nbelieves that a threat to peace anywhere is a threat to \nhumankind as a whole.\n\nIn keeping with our position of principle, we \ncontinue to express our full solidarity with the \nPalestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-\ndetermination. We condemn the systematic killing of \nhundreds of Palestinian civilians, including women and \nchildren, by Israel during the recent offensive in Gaza. \nWe seek a permanent solution to that long-standing \nconflict through the creation of an independent and \nviable State of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders \nand with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\n\nBangladesh strongly believes in the centrality \nand legitimacy of the United Nations as the custodian \nof global peace, security and development. Our \n\ncommitment to international peace is manifest in our \nsupport for the flagship resolution 68/125 on a culture of \npeace and non-violence. Our peace leadership is further \nreaffirmed through our support to the United Nations as \none of the top troop- and police-contributing countries \nin the Organization\u2019s peacekeeping endeavours. We \nhave so far contributed 128,133 peacekeepers in 54 \npeace missions. Bangladesh proudly contributes the \nhighest number of women police to United Nations \npeacekeeping, commensurate with our credentials in \nthe empowerment of women.\n\nTerrorism and extremism remain major impediments \non the road to global peace and development. My \nGovernment maintains a zero-tolerance policy with \nrespect to all forms of terrorism, violent extremism, \nradicalization and faith-based politics. We remain firm \nin our resolve not to allow any terrorist individual or \nentity to use our territory against any State.\n\nThe anti-liberation forces remain active in \nattempting to destroy the progressive and secular \nfabric of our nation. They resort to religious militancy \nand violent extremism at every opportunity. Under \nthe direct patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist \nParty-Jamaat-e-Islami Alliance Government from \n2001 to 2006, they coalesced to form terrorist groups \nthat carried out bomb and grenade attacks and killed \nsecular political leaders and activists. Those gruesome \nattacks cemented my resolve to create a strong legal and \nregulatory regime for countering terrorism, including \nthe adoption of the amended Anti-terrorism Act of 2013 \nand the Money Laundering Prevention Act of 2012.\n\nMy Government is also seeking to entrench \ndemocracy, secularism and women\u2019s empowerment in \norder to defeat terrorism and extremism ideologically. \nWe have also significantly enhanced transparency and \naccountability in governance by strengthening our \nelection, anti-corruption, human rights and information \ncommissions. To uphold peace and the rule of law and \nend the culture of impunity, my Government remains \npledge-bound to bring to justice the perpetrators of \nwar crimes, crimes against humanity, rape and acts of \ngenocide committed during our 1971 war of liberation. \nThe highly transparent, impartial and independent \ninternational crimes tribunals in Bangladesh have \nalready completed the trials of a few key criminals \nwho carried out heinous crimes against humanity. We \nhope for the international community\u2019s full support for \nour people\u2019s desire for this long-awaited rendering of \njustice.\n\nOur Government has integrated the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) into our national \nfive-year plan and Vision 2021, a people-centric \nprogramme that aspires to transform Bangladesh into \na knowledge-based, technology-driven middle-income \ncountry by 2021. Bangladesh has already met or is on \ntrack to meet the first six MDGs. Poverty rates have \nfallen from 57 per cent in 1991 to below 25 per cent \ntoday. During the past five years, our gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth rate remained at 6.2 per cent, \ndespite a global recession. Our export earnings grew \nmore than threefold from around $10.53 billion in \n2006 to more than $30.5 billion for the last fiscal year. \nRemittances have also almost tripled, from $5 billion \nin 2006 to $14.5 billion, while our foreign currency \nreserves jumped six and a half times, from $3.49 billion \nin 2006 to $22 billion today.\n\nIn an effort to unlock Bangladesh\u2019s development \npotential, we have undertaken some massive \ninfrastructure and connectivity projects. We have begun \nwork on a 6.15-kilometre bridge over the great river \nPadma using our own resources. We will soon begin \ndeveloping a deep-sea port in Sonadia, Chittagong. We \nare already working on upgrading our road and rail \ninfrastructure, including expressways and river tunnels. \nWe have reached agreements with friendly countries \nsuch as India, China and Japan to develop large-scale \npower plants to meet our growing demands by 2021. We \nare developing 18 economic zones around the country \nto enable potential investors to invest in Bangladesh, \nespecially in the context of our growing integration \ninto the regional connectivity framework. Bangladesh \nenjoys a clear demographic dividend, with two thirds \nof its workforce young, employable and capable of \nremaining economically active till 2031. One of our \npolicy priorities is investing in skills development for \nour increasingly youthful population.\n\nWith a view to developing a knowledge-based \nsociety, we are rapidly building the capabilities of our \ncountry and people in the area of modern information \nand communications technologies. Our people currently \nreceive more than 200 types of service from more than \n4,500 union service and information centres, while rural \npopulations have access to health-care services from \nmore than 15,000 information-technology-connected \ncommunity health clinics and union health centres. \nThese networks enable us to bring various crucial \npublic services to our people\u2019s homes at an affordable \ncost. Bangladesh has 117 million SIM cards with more \n\nthan 78 per cent telephone penetration and 50 million \nInternet connections.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s strides in education have enabled \nus to achieve the MDG targets of ensuring universal \nprimary school enrolment and gender parity in primary \nand secondary schools. Our Government provides \nstudents with a free education up to the twelfth grade \nand provides 12.8 million students, 75 per cent of them \ngirls, from poor families with monthly stipends from \nprimary level to graduation. Each year we distribute \naround 318 million free textbooks to all students up to \nthe secondary level. We are now focusing on improving \nthe quality of education to enable our boys and girls to \nacquire essential life skills and grow up with a truly \nglobal outlook.\n\nFor us, sustainable development implies the \nempowerment of women and their equal participation \nwith men in all walks of life. Our efforts to promote \nwomen\u2019s empowerment by enhancing their access \nto productive resources and representation at the \nnational and local level are producing visible results. \nThe Government\u2019s pragmatic policies have helped \nleadership by women grow from the grass-roots to the \nhighest levels. Bangladesh may be the only country \ntoday where women concurrently occupy the positions \nof Prime Minister, Speaker, leader of the opposition \nand deputy leader. In the judiciary, administration, the \ncivil service, the armed forces and law enforcement \nagencies, 10 per cent of posts are reserved for women, \nas are 60 per cent of primary-school teaching posts.\n\nWith a view to ensuring equality, my Government \nhas established numerous social safety-net programmes \nthat cover more than 24 per cent of the population, \nnotably feeding and development programmes for \nvulnerable groups; the Ashrayan poverty alleviation \nproject, which provides housing and income generation \nfor the homeless; monthly pensions for senior citizens, \nwidows, destitute women and the disabled; maternity \nallowances; and food and nutrition security for rural \ndwellers through one-house, one-farm schemes aimed \nat promoting family farming. Persons with disabilities \nare provided with education, skills development and \ninterest-free credit for self-employment, with a 1 per \ncent jobs quota reserved for them in the formal sector.\n\nThe MDGs have been the most successful global \nanti-poverty push in history. It is due to them that the \nworld is seeing 50 per cent less poverty than in 1990, \nas well as more girls in school, fewer children dying \nand more people with access to safe drinking water \nand sanitation. However, progress has been uneven and \nunequal within and among countries and regions. Sadly, \nmore than 1.3 billion people still live in abject poverty. \nAs we reflect on our new and emerging development \nchallenges, eradication of poverty must remain at the \ncentre of the post-2015 agenda, and we must build \nlinkages from it to all other goals. Our new framework \nmust achieve a balance between the three pillars of \nsustainable development, and it should particularly \nkeep in mind the importance of access and the unique \ncircumstances and diverse needs of countries such \nas Bangladesh. I am pleased that the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals has used a \nrigorous, broadly inclusive process to come up with \nrecommendations for a set of interlinked goals and \ntargets.\n\nIn Bangladesh, we have held national consultations \nand remained intensely engaged in the global process. \nWe consider the set of goals and targets a carefully \nbalanced package and a crucial basis for the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. The future development agenda \nmust address low-income developing countries\u2019 long-\nstanding constraints on resources and capacity in a \nmeaningful way and respond to emerging risks and \nvulnerabilities. The post-2015 development framework \nmust fulfil our aspirations for building an equitable, \nprosperous and sustainable world where no person \nor nation is left behind. It must also contribute to a \nstrengthened multilateralism, go beyond the national \npolicy space and forge international cooperation. \nGreater resources would be key to the success of the \npost-2015 agenda. There is a need for a robust and \nbroad-based global partnership based on the principles \nof mutual trust, respect and common but differentiated \nresponsibilities.\n\nBangladesh underscores its clear resolve with \nregard to the financing of sustainable development \nby next year, in particular from the financing for \ndevelopment process. While it is encouraging that some \ndeveloped countries have fulfilled their commitment to \ncontributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national income \n(GNI) and 0.2 per cent of GNI as official development \nassistance (ODA) to the least developed countries \n(LDCs), most other countries have yet to fulfil those \ngoals. At the same time, in a globalized economy, the \nleast developed and most climate-vulnerable countries, \nsuch as Bangladesh, require greater support in terms of \nODA, science and technology innovation and capacity-\n\nbuilding. All products from all LDCs must be granted \nduty- and quota-free access to all markets of developed \ncountries.\n\nThe world today is witnessing unprecedented \nhuman mobility within and beyond borders. Bangladesh \nhas emerged as a key stakeholder in global migration. \nFor instance, remittances contribute approximately \n14 per cent of our GDP. Millions of our migrant \nworkers continue to make a significant contribution \nto development in a range of countries worldwide. We \nneed to acknowledge the manifold contributions that \nmigrants and their families make to our economies and \nsocieties apart from just remittances. It is therefore \nlogical for migration and development issues to find \na well-deserved space across the emerging post-\n2015 framework. It is my pleasure to announce that \nBangladesh will chair the ninth Global Forum on \nMigration and Development in 2016.\n\nNo challenge is as complex, widespread and \nformidable as climate change, in particular for \ncountries such as ours. A recent Asian Development \nBank report estimated that the mean economic cost of \nclimate change and adaptation for Bangladesh would \nbe between 2 and 9 per cent of GDP by 2100. Earlier, \nI emphasized before the Assembly that an increase of \n1\u00b0C in the temperature is estimated to lead to a 1-metre \nrise in the sea level, thereby submerging a fifth of the \nterritory of Bangladesh. That could compel 30 million \nof our people to move elsewhere as climate migrants. \nFor Bangladesh, climate change is a matter of bare \nsurvival.\n\nIn addressing climate change, adaptation remains \nparticularly key for us. We have a crucial need for \nadequate, predictable and additional climate financing, \naccess to locally adaptable technologies and support \nfor capacity- and institution-building. We reiterate, \nunder United Nations leadership, in particular through \nthe role of the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC), the importance of the \nprocesses for the integration of the UNFCCC, disaster-\nrisk reduction and the sustainable development goals.\n\nThe world also needs to recognize the untapped \npotential of an ocean-based blue economy. The coastal \nand small island developing States stand to greatly \nbenefit from the balanced conservation, development \nand use of marine ecosystems, resources and services. \nWe call for global support for coastal countries, such as \nBangladesh, in developing the much-needed capacity, \ntechnology and institutional frameworks that will \nenable us to tap into blue opportunities. For that reason, \nwe continue to support the inclusion of blue-economy \nprinciples and practices in the post-2015 framework.\n\nBangladesh proposed a flagship resolution at \nUNESCO, adopted in 1999, which led to the recognition \nof 21 February as the International Mother Language \nDay for the peoples of the world. We established the \nonly International Mother Language Institute in Dhaka \nto preserve the more than 6,500 mother tongues of \nhumankind. Those are two pillars of our commitment \nto mother languages. I once again call on the Assembly \nto recognize Bangla, which is spoken by more than \n300 million people, as an official language of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nThis year, Bangladesh celebrates 40 years of its \nmembership of the United Nations. On this special \noccasion, I should like to reaffirm, on behalf of \nour people, the appeal by the father of our nation, \nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, for our progeny \nat this Assembly in 1974: Let us together create a world \nthat can eradicate poverty, hunger, war and human \nsuffering and achieve global peace and security for the \nwell-being of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to join earlier speakers in offering my \ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. My thanks also go to our outgoing President, \nMr. John Ashe, for his excellent work over the past \nyear, especially his contribution to the discussions on \nthe post-2015 development agenda. I offer my profound \nappreciation to the many United Nations officials, \npeacekeepers and volunteers in the field who often \nwork in the most difficult conditions and put their lives \nat risk.\n\nIt is also fitting to offer our thanks and gratitude \nto the Secretary-General and his team for tirelessly \npromoting the cause of this world body, especially with \nrespect to urgent matters affecting the livelihoods and \nsecurity of our peoples. I also deeply appreciate his \npersonal support at the fifth summit of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United \nNations held in Brunei Darussalam last year.\n\nToday is a special occasion for me personally and \nfor Brunei Darussalam as a nation. It marks the thirtieth \nanniversary of our membership in the Organization. \nLooking back, the world then was ideologically divided. \nNow we are linked by globalization and interdependence, \nsearching for a united approach to addressing the many \nchallenges faced by the human race. As we confront old \nand new problems, I believe the United Nations is best \nplaced to address them collectively. That is its strength, \na fact that is evident today as we strive to realize the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\n\n\nWe are fast approaching the deadline of the MDGs, \nand we in Brunei Darussalam are pleased to see that \nthere is concerted global commitment and consensus \nwith respect to eradicating extreme poverty and \nfurther promoting peace and sustainable development. \nBrunei Damssalam actively contributes to regional \nand international efforts in the areas of training and \ncapacity-building through the Initiative for ASEAN \nIntegration and through collaboration with the United \nStates in an English enrichment programme for \nASEAN. Similar undertakings have also been carried \nout through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical \nCooperation.\n\nThe work of the United Nations and its relevant \nstakeholders in leading the way forward beyond 2015 \nis indeed laudable. I am encouraged by the fact that we \nhave accomplished a great deal in the current initiative. \nWe have also learned many valuable lessons that will \nhelp carry us through our journey in the coming decades. \nIt is reassuring to know that extensive discussions \nand wide-ranging consultations have been conducted \nto shape a universal framework for delivering and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda. I therefore welcome the new development \nagenda and its emphasis on the importance of a human \ndevelopment process that is inclusive, people-centred \nand sustainable.\n\nThose elements are also integral to Brunei \nDarussalam\u2019s National Vision 2035, which is dedicated \nto improving the welfare of our people and ensuring \na high quality of life. I am also pleased that there is \nunanimous agreement on the importance of protecting \nthe environment. In that regard, I greatly value the \nconvening of the United Nations climate summit to \ngalvanize support for addressing the impact of climate \nchange and in ensuring a dynamic and sustainable post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nHowever, the full realization of our noble \nexpressions for the near future and the decades to come \nfaces many obstacles. The international and regional \nsituation continues to be threatened by instability, \ninjustices, social and economic inequalities and \nincreasingly frequent occurrences of natural disasters. \nWhile there is relative peace and stability in the world, \ndevelopments over the past year have reminded us \nof how complex security issues can cause turmoil \nand instability that threaten progress in long-term \ndevelopment. We are gravely concerned with security \ndevelopments in many parts of the world. Further \nescalation of conflicts can weaken the international \ncommunity\u2019s resolve and ability to work together to \nachieve our worldwide initiatives.\n\nFor its part, Brunei Darussalam has participated \nin United Nations peacekeeping, specifically in the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and other \ninternational peace monitoring missions, such as our \nwork in the southern Philippines. We remain committed \nto such endeavours.\n\nThe overall outlook is further complicated by \nchallenges that are global in nature, ranging from the \nimpact of climate change, extremism and terrorism \nto the serious repercussions of pandemic diseases. \nBrunei Darussalam stands united with the international \ncommunity in combating terrorism in all its forms \nand in rejecting extremism. We support all regional \nand international efforts to counter terrorism, and we \nwill continue to participate in global initiatives such as \ninterfaith dialogues and dialogues among civilizations \ndesigned to promote understanding, tolerance and \nrespect among world communities.\n\nI call on every nation to take concerted action in \nworking to ensure that the rapid pace of globalization \nand interconnectedness brings wide-ranging benefits \nto all our peoples and communities. In securing the \npositive aspects of globalization, as a community \nof nations we must work closely together. We must \nrenew our approach to governance and strengthen \nour cooperation, especially in resolving new issues \nthat require collective global action and unity of \npurpose. I would like to emphasize the importance of \na comprehensive approach, especially when it comes \nto ensuring peace and security. Our peoples\u2019 quality \nof life can be further enhanced only through inclusive \neconomic development and equitable social progress.\n\nAt the same time, all our efforts to develop our \neconomies should not work to the detriment of our \nnatural environment. These are areas that demand \nrenewed commitment, partnership and creativity on \nthe part of our global community. I would also like \nto underscore the importance of strengthening our \ncapabilities in disaster management. The frequent \nrecurrence and growing intensity of natural disasters in \nrecent years have caused great destruction and hardship \nto many communities around the world. Last year, \nBrunei Darussalam hosted a humanitarian assistance \nand disaster relief exercise for military personnel from \nacross the Asia-Pacific region, the first such event of \nits kind under the auspices of the ASEAN Defence \n\n\nMinisters Meeting Plus process. During the exercise, I \nwas very inspired as I witnessed the close cooperation \nand unity shown by the diverse range of participants \nfrom different nations, cultures and backgrounds, all \nstriving together to practise saving lives.\n\nSuch regional efforts are just a modest step. More \nimportant, the fundamental principles of mutual respect \nand trust, putting aside differences, upholding the rule \nof law and justice and promoting cooperation should \nserve as the basis for resolving conflicts, so that we \ncan all enjoy continued peace and stability. In the same \nspirit, I also hope that we can overcome our differences \nand move forward in further opening up global trade.\n\nAll our efforts to achieve the MDGs will be in \nvain if, at the same time, we disregard our commitment \nto pursuing peaceful means of settling disputes, as \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \nescalation of disputes and threats to international peace \nand security has resulted in appalling human tragedies \nsuch as the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-\n17 and the current dire situation in Gaza. Although the \nprospects of all-out war seem remote today, instances \nof worsening situations, skirmishes and brinkmanship \nhave shown us all too well how threats of conflict \nand violence remain an obstacle to our long-term \naspirations for a better world. For Palestine, freedom \nand justice are long overdue. The cycle of suffering \nexperienced by our Palestinian brothers and sisters is a \nstark example of how little our development goals mean \nif there is no peace or stability. The Palestinian people \nmust be granted their basic right to live in dignity and \nenjoy economic development. We are encouraged by \nthe observance of the current ceasefire by the parties \ninvolved, and I greatly appreciate the efforts of other \ncountries that have made that possible.\n\nLooking to the future, I remain hopeful. I still \nfirmly believe that we need this Organization in \norder to ensure that generations to come will enjoy a \nsecure and prosperous future. The world has changed \nfundamentally since the adoption of the MDGs, and \nI am confident that the United Nations will continue \nto be a source of hope. It is important that all States \ndo everything they can to contribute positively to our \nOrganization.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin \nby congratulating the President on his election. His \nwisdom and experience will stand him in good stead as \nhe guides the General Assembly.\n\nI would like to pay tribute to the health workers \nwho are fighting Ebola in West Africa. Malaysia was \nable to contribute more than 20 million rubber gloves \nto help the doctors and nurses who are working to stop \nthe outbreak. Our prayers are with them.\n\nI also wish to thank all those who came to \nMalaysia\u2019s aid in this difficult year. Flights MH-370 \nand MH-17 were tragedies that will stay with us forever. \nAs we mourn the loss of life, we take heart from the \ncompassion shown by our friends. Their support will \nnot be forgotten. We thank our friends and allies who \nare giving their time and their resources to help find \nFlight MH-370. Men and women continue to risk their \nlives searching the deepest oceans. We owe them our \ngratitude and our commitment. We will not give up the \nsearch. We are also grateful to our international partners \nthat are working together to investigate the loss of Flight \nMH-17. Malaysia will continue to seek justice for those \nwho died. We urge all parties to continue to cooperate \nwith the investigation. We also hope that those two \ntragedies will change the global aviation system for the \nbetter and that nations will unite behind new standards \nfor aircraft tracking and overflying conflict zones.\n\nFour years ago, I stood before the General Assembly \nand called for a global movement of moderates to \ncounter extremism (see A/65/PV.19). Last year, I \nspoke of the conflict between Sunni and Shia that is \ntearing the Muslim world apart (see A/68/PV.18). Now \nthose two forces \u2014 violent extremism and religious \nintolerance \u2014 have joined hands beneath a black flag. \nTwo countries fractured by war face a new threat \u2014 a \nself-declared Islamic State. Its victims are Sunni and \nShia, Yazidi and Kurd \u2014 anyone who will not bow \nbefore the sword.\n\nThat so-called State, torn from existing nations with \nviolence, rules by violence. Its authority is maintained \nby forced conversions and public executions. Its \nmilitants have destroyed lives and communities. They \nhave destabilized fragile nations and threatened regional \nsecurity. Yet their dark ambition stretches further still. \nThey challenge the very notion of the State. They call \nto our youth with the siren song of illegitimate jihad. \nThey demand that all Muslims swear allegiance to their \nso-called caliph. That demand will never be met. We \nreject the so-called Islamic State. We reject such a State \ndefined by extremism. We condemn the violence being \ncommitted in the name of Islam.\n\nAround the world, Muslims have watched in despair \nas our religion \u2014 a religion of peace \u2014 has been used \nto justify atrocities. We have turned away in horror at \nthe crucifixions and the beheadings. We have mourned \nthe sons who have been stolen and the daughters who \nhave been sold. We know that the threat to world peace \nand security is not Islam but extremism \u2014 intolerant, \nviolent and militant extremism. The actions of those \nmilitants are beyond conscience and belief. They \nviolate the teachings of Islam, the example set by the \nProphet Muhammad and the principles of Islamic law.\n\nAs we speak, some Syrians and Iraqis are being \nforced to abandon their faith. Yet the Koran states: \n\u201cThere shall be no compulsion in religion\u201d (The \nHoly Koran II:256). They are being forced from their \nhomes and forced to convert to Islam. Yet the Koran \nsays: \u201cTo you be your religion, and to me my religion\u201d \n(ibid., CIX:6). If they do not comply, they face death. \nYet the protection of life is a fundamental precept of \nIslamic law, and the killing of civilians, even in war, is \nprohibited in Islam.\n\nThe question is: How should we respond? In the \npast, when the world mobilized to fight extremists, we \nlaunched wars without planning for peace. We attacked \none evil only to see a greater evil emerge. This time \nmust be different. This time, we must defeat not only \nthe extremists but also their ideas. We must confront \nthe heresy of a State conceived by ungodly men and \nenforced through violence. In its place, we must advance \nthe true Islam \u2014 the Islam founded on the principles of \npeace, tolerance and respect, as set out in the Koran, the \nSunna and the Hadith. There are key things we must do.\n\nFirst, security and statehood must be returned to \nthe people of Syria and Iraq. Malaysia co-sponsored \nSecurity Council resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign \nterrorist fighters to strengthen our commitment to \ngalvanizing international action to combat terrorism. \nWe call on the international community to stop the flow \nof money and recruits to extremist groups. We continue \nto offer humanitarian assistance under the ambit of the \nUnited Nations or internationally recognized bodies \nto those who are displaced by the fighting. Attacks \n\non militant targets should, at all cost, avoid collateral \ndamage.\n\nSecondly, we must pursue a different kind of \npolitics. The emergence of such militants is a symptom \nof political failure, of poor governance in fragile States \nand the conflict that still rages between Sunni and \nShia. We must break the cycle where one group gains \npower only to wield it against the other, and where \nmarginalization leads to radicalization, as people \nlose confidence in the State\u2019s ability to provide both \nsecurity and coexistence. Individuals and ethnic and \nreligious groups need to feel that they have a stake in \na nation\u2019s success, not its failure. We should therefore \ncommit to more inclusive politics. That is a difficult \ntask. It demands pragmatism and compromise and must \ncome from within.\n\nMalaysia stands ready to share its experience \nin marginalizing extremism, in maintaining a \nmultireligious country, where different faiths coexist \nand prosper, and in showing that Islam can not only \nsucceed but also drive progress and development in a \npluralistic society. Like all nations, we have had our \ngrowing pains. Stability is never permanent. It must be \nactively maintained. But in Malaysia, there are streets \nin which mosques, temples and churches stand side by \nside. Ours is a society in which religions may differ, \nbut they do so in peace, in the knowledge that we are all \ncitizens of one nation.\n\nWe believe that such a moderate approach can \nmake a valuable contribution to fragile States and \ninternational affairs alike. It is a philosophy that we \nhave applied when acting as an honest broker in peace \nprocesses in the southern Philippines and elsewhere. \nIt is a principle that we will pursue as we chair the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next \nyear, when it forms the 600-million strong ASEAN \nCommunity, with greater political security and \neconomic and sociocultural integration.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Malaysia will work with all \ninterested partners to move the moderation agenda \nforward at the United Nations. That work informs our \nbid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for \nthe coming term. The moderation agenda involves us \nall. The fight against extremism is not about Christians \nversus Muslims or Muslims versus Jews but moderates \nversus extremists of all religions. We need to rally a \ncoalition of moderates \u2014 those willing to reclaim their \nreligion and pursue the path to peace.\n\nI therefore reiterate my call on the leading figures \nin all the great religious traditions. Let us join together \nto ensure that religion is the source of healing and \nblessing rather than conflict and destruction. In that \nrespect, I welcome Pope Francis\u2019s visit to Palestine and \nhis efforts to bring moderate Palestinians and Israelis \ntogether to pray for peace. By demonstrating moderation \nin the political process, we can ensure that no one is left \noutside society. By practising moderation in religion, \nwe can marginalize the extremists. By committing to \nmoderation here at the United Nations, we can show \nthat the world is willing to fight extremism not just \nwith short-term military operations but with long-term \nplans.\n\nThe security response of the international \ncommunity and a commitment to more inclusive politics \non the part of affected countries will remove two of the \nconditions that allow extremism to take hold. However, \nin order to defeat the extremists, we must undermine \ntheir authority and erode their appeal. We must \nconfront their propaganda. We must defeat the message \nthat seduces young people into acts of violence. And \nwe must address any legitimate grievances that drive \npeople to extremism, be they political or economic. In \nshort, we must win the hearts and minds of those who \nwould serve the so-called caliph.\n\nThat is the work of a generation. To begin, we \nshould focus on the real-world conditions that allow \ndisillusion to grow. That means building sustainable \neconomies that bring opportunities for our young \npeople and addressing legitimate concerns that drive \nradicalization.\n\nMalaysia, like so many countries around the \nworld, was appalled by the brutal violence against \nPalestinian civilians in Gaza. We strongly condemn \nIsrael\u2019s disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks \non Gaza and its continuing violations of international \nand human rights law. The use of heavy weapons in \ncivilian areas and the obliteration of houses, mosques \nand schools were an affront to common decency. We \ncondemn such acts not just for the innocent lives taken \nbut for the message that they send, namely, that religions \ncannot coexist and that the international community \ncannot enforce international law and protect the rights \nof Palestinians. Their plight is one of the most effective \nrallying calls for those who claim that the international \nsystem is broken. \n\nLet us therefore unite to find a peaceful, just and \nlasting outcome that brings dignity and security to the \n\npeople of Palestine. That should be predicated on a \ntwo-State solution based on the 1967 borders, with East \nJerusalem as its capital. That will bring dignity and \nsecurity for the people of Palestine, who have suffered \nso much, and will allow us to redouble our efforts to \nbring peace to other parts of the world where conflict \nfuels extremism.\n\nWe must also understand why those militants \nsucceed in drawing people to their cause. The \nextremists call upon Muslims to pledge their allegiance \nto their self-proclaimed caliphates in Syria and Iraq, \nin Nigeria and Somalia and in Kenya and Libya. They \nreach out to a people in search of a State. The fact that \nsome answer that call is testament to our failure. We \nhave failed to uphold a vision of moderate and inclusive \nIslamic development and to tackle isolation in our own \ncommunities.The fight against extremists must be won \nnot just in Syria and Iraq but also in Britain, Belgium, \nthe United States and Malaysia. We have managed \nto prevent extremism from gaining a foothold in our \ncountry. Yet even a few Malaysians have been lured \nby foreign terrorist fighters, who led them to Iraq and \nSyria.\n\nCountries must educate, include and, where \nnecessary, confront those at risk of radicalization. Our \nreligious leaders must continue to show that faith and \nsociety are best aligned under a just rule of law. We \nmust continue to make the case that the moderate path \nis the righteous path \u2014 the path that Allah set out for \nus when he said, \u201cwe have made you into a community \nthat is moderate, justly balanced\u201d (ibid., II:143).\n\nWe must confront the myth that committing \natrocities in the name of an Islamic State is an act of \nfaith and that death in the service of that aim brings \nmartyrdom. The extremists use that distorted narrative \nas a recruitment tool. To counter that deception, \nMuslims should work together to promote a greater \nunderstanding of what a true Islamic State means. An \ninternational conference of scholars of Islamic law, \nconvened by my Government to define the true meaning \nof an Islamic State, agreed that for a State to be called \nIslamic, it must deliver economic, political and social \njustice. It must protect and further the six objectives of \nIslamic law: the right to life, religion, family, property, \ndignity and intellect \u2014 the same universal rights that \nare enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of \nHuman Rights.\n\nThe so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and \nthe methods used to declare it have violated every \nsingle one of those objectives. It is therefore neither \nIslamic nor a State. Individuals, religious leaders and \nnations have said that and must continue to do so and \nto advocate for Islamic principles within a framework \nof tolerance, understanding and peace.That, after all, is \nthe true nature of Islam; a religion of peace that values \ncoexistence, mutual comprehension and learning, \neven in times of struggle. When 70 prisoners of war \nwere captured during the Battle of Badr, for example, \nthe Prophet Muhammad was urged to slay them. \nThe Prophet not only protected the lives of innocent \ncivilians, he also spared enemy combatants.\n\nIt is that spirit of understanding and compassion \nthat we should continue to embrace and espouse. Now \nis the time to advance a vision of peace and moderation. \nLet us call for a global community of understanding. \nLet us prove that we can honour the words of the \nProphet and build balanced and just societies, where \ndifferent faiths live and prosper in peace. Let us show \nthat Muslims, united in faith, can be a powerful force \nfor progress, knowledge and justice, as we were in the \ngreatest periods of our history, as we can be today, and \nas we will be tomorrow."

        "file_text": "As \nPresident of Mexico, it is a high honour for me to \nparticipate for the first time in the General Assembly, \nthe greatest symbol of unity among nations. Mexico \nreiterates its historic commitment to this universal \nforum of dialogue, understanding and cooperation.\n\nToday\u2019s world could not be imagined without \nthe United Nations. Its positive influence is present \nin all realms of our lives. The United Nations leads \ninternational efforts to combat hunger, pandemics and \nclimate change. It protects our children, preserves the \nheritage of humanity and furthers the empowerment \nand advancement of women around the world. The \nOrganization promotes trade and global communications \nas well as human rights and peace. Thanks to the United \n\n\nNations, our world today enjoys greater freedom and is \nmore democratic and more developed.\n\nWhile United Nations contributions to the well-\nbeing of millions of people are indeed evident, one \ncannot deny the multiple challenges that every country \nof this planet is currently facing. From the global \neconomy that has yet to recover its dynamism, to \nregional conflicts that have caused deaths and forced \nmigration flows, to climate change triggering natural \ndisasters, it is clear that the world requires multilateral \nresponses that are more effective.\n\nIn a world with so many phenomena that transcend \nborders, international cooperation is more necessary \nthan ever, and the sum of global efforts can emerge only \nhere, at the United Nations. Today, our planet needs \nto be able to depend on a more effective, efficient, \ntransparent and representative United Nations, where \nall societies of the world have greater participation. The \nUnited Nations must dare to change in order to improve.\n\nIn Mexico, we firmly believe that the United \nNations has all the attributes to be more daring and self-\nrenewing. With respect to institutional change, we need \na Security Council that evolves and that truly represents \nthe new world equilibrium. It is important to reform \nthe Council in order to strengthen its transparency, \naccountability and capacity to respond. We believe that \nthe Security Council should be enlarged by increasing \nthe number of non-permanent members, creating long-\nterm seats with the possibility of immediate re-election \nas part of a more equitable geographic representation. \nThe world needs a United Nations where the permanent \nmembers of the Council refrain from using the veto in \ncases of grave violations of international humanitarian \nlaw.\n\nWith respect to international peace and security, \nthe United Nations must prevent arms trafficking \nand the serious damage that phenomenon inflicts on \nour societies. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) provides \nthe tools to tackle that growing challenge. However, \nit is vital that all nations sign the Treaty, but, more \nimportantly, that they all ratify it. The First Conference \nof States Parties to the ATT will be held in Mexico next \nyear. It will be a great opportunity for all nations to \nwork together to prevent arms from hurting children or \nvulnerable populations around the world.\n\nSimilarly, we must also strengthen the United \nNations so that it can effectively combat terrorism, \nwhich is lacerating societies around the world.\n\nIn addition, we need the United Nations to renew \nits efforts for nuclear disarmament. We must prevent \nmore countries or non-State actors from having that \ndestructive capacity within reach, and we must also \ndemand that those already possessing it reduce and \neliminate those weapons. If we want a safer world, \nno one should use or threaten to use nuclear power to \nendanger the very survival of humankind itself.\n\nI turn next to the development agenda. Now that \nthe date is approaching to define the sustainable \ndevelopment goals, we need a United Nations with a \nbroader vision of the well-being of individuals. The \npost-2015 development agenda must recognize that \npoverty is not determined solely by insufficient income, \nbut also by other scarcities that impede personal and \ncollective development. Furthermore, we believe that \neconomic and social inclusion should be one of the \nprincipal points of the agenda.\n\nThe United Nations also needs to update its \ncommitment to the rights of girls, boys and adolescents, \naddressing new challenges that threaten their integrity. \nWe should initiate at the global level a joint initiative \nto combat harassment at school, or psychological \nharassment like bullying, and at the same time reinforce \nbasic values among our children and youths. If we want \nfor tomorrow a world in which adults have a spirit of \nempathy, understanding, friendship among peoples, \npeace and universal brotherhood, we need to act now \nwith more determination so that our children and our \nyouth can live free from any type of abuse.\n\nIn short, to address the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century, we need a United Nations with a new \ninstitutional design, with a renewed commitment to \npeace and security and, above all, with a comprehensive \nand inclusive development agenda. Change is never \neasy, especially when it demands a fundamental \ntransformation and when it depends on the cooperation \nof multiple actors, each with its own priorities and \ninterests. In the specific case of the United Nations, \nmultiple voices acknowledge the need for a change, but \nat the same time, they believe it is an impossible task \nbecause no one is willing to yield.\n\nIn Mexico, we experienced a similar situation. \nThere were those who agreed on the urgency of \npromoting structural changes domestically, but they \nalso warned that it would not be possible to carry \nthem out. Those voices affirmed that political groups \nand the Government of the republic would not be able \nto reach agreement in order to transform our nation. \n\n\nNonetheless, Mexico demonstrated that it is possible to \nbuild with a plurality, that diversity is a strength when \nthere is a readiness for a constructive dialogue. The \nfoundation for achieving that was the Pact for Mexico, \nan agreement under which all essential commitments \nwere formed in order to advance a broad agenda for \nreforms in a various spheres of the national life.\n\nBuilding upon that innovative political instrument, \nMexicans dared to improve the quality of education, \nto make the job market more flexible and to combat \nmonopolies and anti-competitive practices. We dared \nto modernize the telecommunications sector, to \nincrease the opportunities for credit and reduce its \ncost, to strengthen public finances and to initiate a \nnew model for energy development for the country. We \nMexicans held dialogues and agreed on the renewal \nof our political and electoral institutions and of our \njustice system and accountability system. We decided \nto transform ourselves. Those profound changes were \ndecades overdue, because no political party has held \na majority in Congress in past years. Nevertheless, \nthrough dialogue and consensus it was possible to \nachieve those changes in just 20 months.\n\nWhat was the principal difference from the \npast? It was the will of an entire nation that dared to \nchange. Mexico acted decisively and wisely. It dared \nto transform itself and to set itself in motion. On the \nbasis of that experience, I am convinced that the United \nNations can also change.\n\nAlmost 70 years after its creation, the United \nNations must evolve, as the world has evolved. I know \nit will not be easy to build consensus to succeed, \nbecause inertia must be broken and paradigms must \nbe changed. But I also know that the talent, the vision \nand the audicity needed to achieve that do exist. It is \ntime to build a new United Nations for a new century. \nThat will require that all States have the will to listen, \ndiscuss and tolerate and the capacity to yield. At the \nend of that process, the world will have more a efficient \nOrganization, a United Nations that is able to work \nsuccessfully in favour of the peace and development of \nthe planet. My country is ready to play an active role in \nthe transformation. It is determined to evolve with the \nUnited Nations.\n\nMexico supports and values peacekeeping \noperations, a United Nations instrument that assists \ncountries to overcome conflicts and create conditions \nfor sustainable peace by providing the means for \nreconstruction, humanitarian aid and security. That is \nwhy Mexico has decided to participate in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations, providing humanitarian work \nto benefit civilian populations. Our participation will \nbe in keeping with a clear mandate from the Security \nCouncil and with the foreign-policy norms established \nin our Constitution. With such determination, Mexico, \nas a responsible stakeholder, will take a historic step in \nits commitment to the United Nations.\n\nNext year, the Organization will reach its seventieth \nanniversary. That will offer us a great opportunity to \nmake our plurality both an asset and a strength for \nchange. With the participation of all, with the drive and \nthe boldness of the Member States, the United Nations \ncan transform itself to benefit the whole of humanity."

        "file_name": "AUT_69_2014.txt",
        "file_text": "It is with great respect that \nI stand at this rostrum for the first time as Austrian \nForeign Minister. Many eminent world leaders have \nstood here before me and laid out their visions on \ninternational challenges and crises. As many may be \nable to tell, probably even from the last row, I look a bit \nyounger than most of the speakers before me. Indeed, \nI believe I am the only person under the age of 30 who \nhas the privilege of speaking here this week. So while \nI cannot speak from many years of experience, what I \ncan offer is the perspective of a young generation.\n\nMy generation is the post-Cold War generation. \nThe Iron Curtain collapsed 25 years ago, when I was 3 \nyears old. For us in Europe, the years after the collapse \nof the Iron Curtain were years filled with hope and new \nopportunities. We could travel freely, study in foreign \ncountries and meet people from all over the world. \nWe grew up in a society where human rights were \nrespected, where the rule of law was a given, and where \nreligious freedom was practised. We communicate \nwithout borders on Facebook and Twitter, we have our \nentire lives stored on our smartphone, and we consume \nthe news online.\n\nWhile the world after the Cold War offered \nfascinating new opportunities, it also proved to be not \norderly at all, but quite messy and more uncertain than \nmany had predicted. Just two years after the Berlin Wall \ncame down, war returned to Europe in the Western \nBalkan countries. Thankfully, the horrors came to an \nend, and these countries now have a clear European \nperspective. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, we \nbelieved that the world would move forward and that \nmore and more people would benefit from the same \nopportunities that my generation in Western Europe \nenjoyed. But the world today seems to be shifting \ninto reverse. We are facing situations and horrors we \nthought we had overcome many years ago. For young \npeople like myself, who learned about the Cold War \nonly through history books, it seems unbelievable that \nthe thinking in terms of confrontational blocs could \nreturn to Europe.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine is probably the most serious \nchallenge to peace and security Europe has had to face \nin decades. In retrospect, it is easy to claim that this \ndevelopment should have been predictable, and that we \nshould have foreseen it. But let us be honest. Who would \nhave predicted that, after three years of negotiations, \nPresident Yanukovych would refuse to sign the \nAssociation Agreement with the European Union? Who \nwould have predicted that the Maidan movement would \nbe strong enough to force him to leave the country? \nAnd who would have predicted that Russia would react \nby annexing Crimea and would even actively support \nseparatist movements?\n\nWe cannot accept that international law should \nbe violated and that recognized borders challenged in \nEurope once again. At the same time, we need to find \n\na political solution that goes beyond a mere ceasefire. \nWe need a solution that offers the prospect of a free, \nstable and united Ukraine, a Ukraine which enjoys \nstrong economic ties with both the European Union \nand the Russian Federation. Let us not return to Cold \nWar thinking, where two blocs face each other. Our \npolitical guideline must be to move from a policy of \n\u201ceither Europe or Russia\u201d to a logic of \u201cboth Europe \nand Russia\u201d.\n\nSome people have claimed that Ukraine would \nnot be in this situation had it not given up its nuclear \nweapons. This kind of thinking is dangerous. And we \nhave to ask ourselves, where would this lead us? As \nlong as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use, on \npurpose or by accident, remains real. Let us be clear: \nthe use of nuclear weapons, more than any other human \naction, has the potential to end life on this planet. And, \n69 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, let us not \nforget that the humanitarian consequences of a single \nnuclear explosion are terrifying and long-lasting. The \ndesire to prevent the humanitarian consequences of \nnuclear weapons should unite us all. We therefore hope \nthat the Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of \nNuclear Weapons in Vienna in December will mark a \nreal change of direction in international discussions on \nnuclear weapons.\n\nLooking beyond our region, we are currently \nwitnessing a further rise of extremism in the name of \nreligion, and a new development \u2014 foreign terrorist \nfighters who come from Western countries and travel \nto the Middle East in order to join the fight. There \nis no time to lose; we must actively address what is \nhappening in northern Iraq, where the so-called Islamic \nState of Iraq and the Levant is attempting to wipe out \nentire religious communities, where children are being \nbeheaded, mothers raped and fathers hanged because of \ntheir beliefs.\n\nIn Europe, we estimate that there are thousands of \nforeign fighters with European passports. In our case, \nthere are more than 140 people from Austria fighting \nin the name of a so-called holy war. We all know that \nthe terrorist organizations operate worldwide. They \nget their terrorist fighters by recruiting globally. They \nfinance themselves through global networks. They \nbuy arms and other resources on a global scale. And \nthey use, or rather abuse, the global communication \nnetworks to their benefit.\n\nHow is it possible that terrorist organizations have \naccess to financial and economic resources that allow \nthem to operate so effectively? How is it possible that \nwe allow terrorist organizations to abuse the right to \nfreedom of expression by showing their barbaric acts \non social media? And how is it possible that they are \nable to recruit new fighters within our societies?\n\nWe all, Governments and the private sector as well, \nhave a duty to develop preventive measures within our \nsocieties to stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, \nto cut off financial support to their organizations and \nto put an end to the abuse of social media networks \nby developing forms of voluntary self-restriction for \nthose networks. The adoption of Security Council \nresolution 2178 (2014) this week was an important first \nstep, but now we must implement it. And we should \nalways remind ourselves that the battle lines in this \nconfrontation are not limited to Iraq or Syria. They run \nthrough our own Western societies.\n\nMy generation in Austria was privileged to grow \nup in freedom from fear and from want. There are, of \ncourse, other stories to be told of young people growing \nup in Afghanistan or the Central African Republic, for \nexample. Today half of the world\u2019s population is under \n25 years of age, and many of them lack adequate nutrition, \nhealth care, education and jobs. All in all, those are not \ngreat prospects for life. The work of the United Nations \non development is therefore crucial to lifting millions \nof people out of poverty, helping the hungry and the \nsick and educating new generations around the world. \nThe United Nations needs and deserves our support, \nand I can assure the Assembly that Austria fully stands \nbehind the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nBut we must also ensure that respect for human \nrights and the rule of law receive proper attention. Only \na society that respects the rights of its citizens can enable \neach individual to develop his or her potential. We are \ntherefore very pleased to be organizing the Second \nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \nCountries, to be held in Vienna in November. And we \nare honoured that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \nagreed to attend the Conference.\n\nI am aware that the list of challenges that the \ninternational community and the United Nations are \nfacing is long: the situations in Iraq, Ukraine, Syria, \nGaza, the Central African Republic and Mali and the \noutbreak of the Ebola disease, to name just a few. In \nview of those challenges, the United Nations needs and \ndeserves our full support. I want to especially thank \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \nat the helm of the United Nations. I can assure him \n\nthat Austria remains committed to working actively \nwithin the United Nations and its bodies to support his \nwork and to address our global challenges, whether as \npeacekeepers, through our presidency of the Economic \nand Social Council or as a member of the Human \nRights Council. We are particularly proud to host the \nUnited Nations Office at Vienna, which has become \nan Austrian landmark. Austria has a long tradition of \nbuilding bridges and serving as a place for international \ndialogue. We will continue to do so in the future and to \noffer our contribution to making the world a little bit \nsafer and better for the generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the \nPresident on his election to preside over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. At the same time, \nI would like to welcome the wise choice that he has \nmade to view his mandate as an extension of the work \nof Ambassador John William Ashe, his predecessor, to \nwhom I pay a well-deserved tribute. I also commend the \nPresident on having chosen a theme for the sixty-ninth \n\nsession that invites us to engage in a comprehensive \nconsideration of the post-2015 agenda. I would also like \nto pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nreiterate to him the unwavering support of the Republic \nof the Congo for the efforts he expends with devotion \nand selflessness at the head of our Organization.\n\nThe world is in turmoil. Humankind lives in \nfear of tensions and conflicts, which exist virtually \neverywhere; of terrorism, which has become the \nbogeyman of States; of old and new epidemics that \nplague societies, especially the poorest among them; \nof the persistent disparities among and within States; \nand of climate change, which threatens our planet. \nThose are the challenges that arouse a feeling of great \napprehension throughout the world.\n\nIn turn, they make us put our faith in the United \nNations, the only instrument available to the world in \nits search for solutions to those many problems. In that \nuniversal quest, the priority action of States must be \ndirected above all to peace, security and the conservation \nof nature. For the world needs peace and security, \nespecially wherever senseless conflicts have developed, \nsuch as in Syria, Ukraine, Iraq and between the Israelis \nand the Palestinians. The world needs peace and security \nin Africa, especially in Libya and throughout the entire \nSahel-Saharan region, in South Sudan, Central Africa \nand the Great Lakes region. Africa needs the increased \nsupport of the international community so that Somalia \ncan, once and for all, emerge from the abyss and so that \nMali can recover its integrity and unity. It needs such \nsupport so that the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nwhich has now experienced a degree of calm, will not \nagain be plunged into the violence that afflicted it for \nso many long years. Finally, it also needs that support \nso that the positive developments seen in the Central \nAfrican Republic in recent weeks with the cessation \nof hostilities agreement, signed in Brazzaville on \n23 July, and the transfer of authority, on 15 September, \nfrom the African-led International Support Mission \nin the Central African Republic to the United Nations \nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \nthe Central African Republic can be strengthened to \nallow the Central African people to emerge from the \ncrisis that has lasted too long.\n\nAfrica needs the ongoing support of the \ninternational community to curb maritime piracy, \nwhich increasingly threatens the Gulf of Guinea, and \nto combat terrorism, which extends from the Sahel \nto the south of the continent, with the involvement of \nmany local networks. That also applies to Boko Haram, \nwhich rages in Nigeria and seeks to spread its activities \ntowards Cameroon, and perhaps soon to other countries \nif nothing is done to prevent it. The same goes for \nthe rebel movement known as Joseph Kony\u2019s Lord\u2019s \nResistance Army, which is still active in the Central \nAfrican Republic, the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo and Uganda.\n\nIn Central Africa, as elsewhere on the continent, \ninsecurity is often the result of a number of factors. There \nare not only war and armed violence but also poverty \nand endemic diseases, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, \nnon-communicable diseases and Ebola haemorrhagic \nfever. We commend the great spirit of solidarity shown \nby the international community in assisting the African \ncountries affected by the Ebola epidemic to eradicate \nthat terrible scourge. In that regard, we welcome the \nestablishment of the United Nations Mission for Ebola \nEmergency Response by the Secretary-General.\n\nI would like to briefly address the issue of climate \nchange, which, as everyone knows, remains a major \nthreat to our planet. The Republic of the Congo, which \nfully shares the Common African Position, supports the \nconclusions of the Elys\u00e9e Summit for Peace and Security \nin Africa of 6 and 7 December 2013. The Climate \nSummit held here in New York on 23 September saw \nthe announcement of firm commitments with a view \nto the adoption of a universal, important and binding \nagreement on both mitigation and adaptation at the \nParis summit in 2015.\n\nIn that regard, I would like to underscore the \nimportance for my country and for Africa of the \nestablishment of technology transfer and innovative \nfinancing mechanisms and of ensuring the maximum \nbenefit and real implementation of the Green Climate \nFund, as well as the promotion of a substantive \nprogramme to counter climate imbalance so as to \nmaximize the opportunities provided by combating \nclimate change.\n\nIllicit logging and the illegal trade in fauna and \nflora are another serious threat to the environment \nand to biodiversity. In response to that international \nenvironmental crime against biodiversity, during the \nfirst half of 2015, my country will host in Brazzaville, \nunder the auspices of the African Union and in \npartnership with the United Nations Environment \nProgramme, an international conference on the illegal \n\n\nexploitation of and the illicit trade in the wild fauna and \nflora of Africa.\n\nThe sixty-ninth session of the Assembly of our \nOrganization takes place on the eve of 2015, the \ndeadline for the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The review undertaken by \nstakeholders at all levels has shown that we have not \nreached those Goals owing to, inter alia, shortcomings \nin their initial preparation and drafting. Africa is the \ncontinent with the largest number of countries that will \nnot have achieved some MDGs by the 2015 deadline. \nAfrican leaders have adopted a Common Position on \nthe post-2015 development agenda in order to meet \nthose challenges. We call for the joint commitment \nof all members to ensure that the Common African \nPosition is placed at the centre of our concerns in the \nnegotiations that should lead to the adoption of an \ninclusive post-2015 development agenda.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to solemnly \nreaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to the promotion \nand protection of fundamental human rights and \nfreedoms, the various mechanisms for the protection \nof human rights and the universal periodic review \nprocess, in which we have actively participated. In that \nspirit, Congo seeks to enrich its legal and institutional \nframework by strengthening its national system for the \npromotion and protection of human rights, with the \nfull participation of civil society. In that context, the \nRepublic of the Congo has decided to present, in the \nupcoming November elections to be held in New York, \nits candidature for a second term on the United Nations \nHuman Rights Council for the period 2015-2017.\n\nSports, as a contributor to peace and development, \nunites peoples. In that spirit, in September 2015 \nBrazzaville will host the eleventh All-African Games \non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of that \nAfrican youth festival.\n\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment \nto the ideals of our universal Organization and reiterate \nour commitment to supporting the efforts of the \nentire international community for peace, security \nand development, on which depend the well-being of \nhumankind and the advent of the better world to which \nwe fervently aspire.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session, and I convey my \nGovernment\u2019s full support in the exercise of your \nhigh duties with the shared goal of promoting United \nNations principles in a period of great uncertainty and \ninstability.\n\nThe General Assembly constitutes the only \ninternational forum in which all Heads of States or \nGovernments gather together in order not only to \nbrief international public opinion about serious issues \nfaced by their countries, but to also deliberate on all \nregional and international challenges that are not \ncountry-specific and that call the international order \ninto question.\n\nWe should always bear in mind that the United \nNations was created with the aim of maintaining \ninternational peace and security, thus fostering the \neffective protection of the fundamental freedoms and \nhuman rights of all people, irrespective of gender, \nracial or ethnic origin, religion or belief. For those \nprinciples at the heart of the Charter of the United \nNations to be upheld, we should all realize that in an \nera of globalization, all Members of the Organization \nare bound to be affected, one way or another, by \nevents unfolding in any country or region, although \nin a dissimilar magnitude and at different times. \nTherefore joint actions are needed, through a common \nunderstanding that despite our individual differences, \nthe path to peace, stability and democracy can be \nachieved only through the United Nations. Enhancing \nits role, adhering to the principles of its Charter and \nimplementing its resolutions are a sine qua non for \neffectively tackling both new and long-standing threats.\n\n\nThe upcoming seventieth anniversary of the United \nNations will be a significant milestone in United \nNations history. Cyprus believes that it is now the right \nmoment to intensify our efforts and commit ourselves \nto move ahead through self-assessment and an all-\ninclusive debate so as to reach a tangible outcome that \nwill strengthen the relevance and effectiveness of the \nOrganization. In that connection, I would like to recall \nthe 2005 World Summit, during which world leaders \nagreed to an early reform of the Security Council.\n\nA year ago, when for the very first time I addressed \nthe Assembly (see A/68/PV.12), I conveyed my deep \nconcern and indignation about acts that we were \nwitnessing that undermined the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of States, causing regional and \nglobal insecurity, such as terrorism, the annexation \nof territories via illegal use of force, religious \nfundamentalism and the forcible displacement of \nmillions of peoples. Unfortunately, despite our efforts, \nwe have to admit that during the past year we have not \nadequately risen to meet those challenges. It is even \nmore worrying that their extent and impact has been \nintensified at the expense of human lives, individual \nand collective social and economic prosperity and, \nultimately, regional and international peace and \nsecurity.\n\nEverything we are witnessing in Libya, Lebanon, \nSyria and Iraq, particularly following the emergence \nof Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and the perpetration \nof its untold atrocities, should not leave us indifferent \nor passive. It is our duty towards humankind and our \nshared values to immediately adopt a more proactive \ninvolvement, so as to save future generations from \nthe plague of asymmetrical threats, terrorism and \nbald hatred. In that connection, we welcome Security \nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), adopted last Wednesday, \nto decisively address the growing threat posed by the \nunprecedented flow of foreign terrorist fighters and \nthe growth of facilitation networks fuelling conflicts \naround the world. We expect that those responsible for \nthe shocking crimes committed in the past few weeks \nwill be held accountable.\n\nAt the same time, we should not ignore that deep-\nrooted and long-standing conflicts possess the ability \nto instantly ignite regional instability, cause bloodshed \nand endanger the lives of thousands of innocent \n\ncivilians, including children. Regrettably, such events \nsow the seeds of animosity and of further violence \nthat render dialogue and negotiations more difficult to \nconduct and to eventually bring to success.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the Middle East peace \nprocess, the right of the Israeli people to statehood \nshould not be called into question, nor should the \nsame right for the people of Palestine. We commend \nthe very positive role of the Egyptian Government in \nmediating between the two sides. At the same time, we \nstrongly urge all interested stakeholders to discourage \nthe activities of terrorist groups that oppose the Middle \nEast peace process.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot remain indifferent to \nwhat is taking place in Ukraine and the repercussions \non the relations between some of the most important \nand influential actors in the world arena \u2014 the United \nStates, the Russian Federation and the European Union. \nWe welcome the agreement reached in Minsk on \n5 September, and we call for it to be honoured and fully \nimplemented by all sides.\n\nOf course, above and beyond those regional \nconflicts, we should be vigilant and remind ourselves \nthat other conventional and unconventional challenges \npose existential dangers that we have yet to tackle. \nThose include, among others, human trafficking, the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nglobal poverty, hunger and distress, which intensify \nmigration flows and create demographic changes and \nthe spread of epidemic such as the recent example \nof Ebola. Moreover, the effects of climate change \ncould eventually, in the distant future, turn out to be \nirreversible and catastrophic.\n\nCyprus lies at the crossroads of Europe, North \nAfrica and the Near and Middle East, a volatile region \nin which most conflicts take place. However, we \ntake pride on being a member State of the European \nUnion (EU) and in enjoying excellent relations with \nall our neighbours. Hence, we are considered to be an \nhonest broker with no hidden agendas. We do realize \nthat our geography is our destiny. We have assumed a \nconstructive role in upholding United Nations values \nand principles and are contributing to peace efforts in \nour region, always, of course, within our capabilities.\n\nWe are at the forefront of efforts to fight terrorism, \nhuman trafficking and the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and to provide humanitarian aid and \nfacilities when deemed necessary. Only yesterday, \nCyprus was instrumental in rescuing around 350 \nSyrian refugees from a fishing boat stranded in the \nMediterranean, thus averting a great humanitarian \ncatastrophe.\n\nThe discovery of hydrocarbons in our \nneighbourhood has undoubtedly upgraded its strategic \nimportance. Energy can serve as a catalyst for broader \ncooperation, thus contributing to peace and stability. \nand can be a means to strengthen regional and EU \nenergy security and diversification. That would boost \nthe economies of the countries in the area. We are ready \nto contribute toward that cause and even to mediate to \nbring together neighbouring hydrocarbon-producing \nand hydrocarbon-consuming countries.\n\nThe year 2014 marks the fortieth anniversary of the \nviolent division of my country as a consequence of the \n1974 invasion and continuing occupation by Turkey. \nIt is not my intention to engage in a blame game, as \na plethora of United Nations resolutions and Security \nCouncil decisions not only truly reflect the historic and \ncontinuing responsibilities of those who are at fault, \nbut also condemn the unacceptable status quo and call \nfor the reunification of Cyprus and the withdrawal of \noccupation forces.\n\nWhat I would like to stress once more is my sincere \ncommitment to working vigorously and with resolve to \nreach, through a constructive, in-depth and substantive \ndialogue, a settlement that will reunite Cyprus and its \npeople, restore the fundamental freedoms and human \nrights of all its lawful citizens, relieve the island of \nthe presence of occupying troops, ensure peaceful \ncoexistence and socioeconomic collaboration among \nall its citizens, and guarantee the effectiveness and \nefficient functioning of Cyprus as an EU member State.\n\nFor me, there is only one plan, and that is to reach \na settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of \nwhat has been agreed as a compromise: the evolution \nof the Republic of Cyprus into a bicommunal, bizonal \nfederation with political equality, as set out in the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions and the high-\nlevel agreements, with a single sovereignty, a single \ninternational legal personality and a single citizenship.\n\nAfter months of difficult negotiations, a joint \ndeclaration was agreed between the two communities \non 11 February 2014, setting out the basic guidelines \nand principles for reaching the framework of the agreed \nsolution, as well as the methodology of the negotiating \nprocess. At the same time, it is extremely important \n\n\nthat the joint declaration clearly articulates that the \nshared, sole purpose of the negotiating process is to end \nthe unacceptable status quo and reach a settlement that \nwill safeguard and respect the principles upon which \nthe European Union is founded. Following the joint \ndeclaration and intensive negotiations between the two \nsides, comprehensive proposals on all chapters of the \nCyprus problem have been submitted. We have now \nreached the phase of concentrating our efforts to bridge \nthe differences so as to pave the way towards a viable, \nlasting solution.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to warmly welcome \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s recent appointment of his new \nSpecial Adviser, Mr. Espen Barth Eide. We believe \nthat that appointment at this critical juncture in the \nnegotiation process demonstrates the United Nations\u2019 \ndetermination to ensure that that process moves \ndecisively forward. However, it goes without saying \nthat what is also needed is a demonstration of a genuine \nwill by our compatriots to negotiate in good faith and \nby Turkey to contribute constructively to the efforts to \nreach a settlement, not only in theory and rhetoric, but \nthrough practical and substantial actions.\n\nA first step towards the long-awaited demonstration \nof genuine political will would be the adoption of \nmy package proposal for bold confidence-building \nmeasures that would create a win-win situation \nfor all parties concerned, helping to build mutual \nunderstanding, confidence and good will and thereby \nserving as a catalyst for the ongoing negotiating process. \nMoreover, we expect Turkey\u2019s sincere cooperation on \nthe humanitarian issue of missing persons, including \nthrough granting access to all areas as required and \nproviding the necessary information that will help \nshed light on their fate and alleviate the pain of their \nrelatives.\n\nCyprus and its citizens deserve much more than a \ndivided country. Forty years is more than enough for all \nof us. It is high time for all those involved to realize that \nthe artificial complacency with regard to the status quo \nbenefits no one. A solution would benefit all Cypriots, \nTurkey, our immediate region and the international \ncommunity. My ultimate vision is to relieve all Cypriots, \nespecially the younger generation \u2014 the future of the \ncountry \u2014 of the anachronistic burden of having to live \nin a divided country in which they are forcibly prevented \nfrom enjoying the freedoms that are the birthright of \nevery citizen in the world \u2014 a burden that they are not \nto blame for and are entitled to see redressed. I will \nnot deviate from pursuing that vision, as that is the \nduty I have undertaken towards all Cypriots. Nor will \nI shy away from the historic responsibility to provide a \nstable, peaceful and prosperous and conciliatory future \nin my country.\n\nIt would be a serious omission if, before concluding, \nI did not extend the sincere gratitude of my people \nand my Government to the Secretary-General and the \nSecurity Council for the work of the United Nations \nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus over the past 50 years, \nwhich constitutes a prime example of the successful \nrole that the United Nations can play in peacekeeping. \nWhile we greatly value the benefits of peacekeeping \nand the role played by the United Nations to that end, we \nconsider that it is even more important to support and \nempower the Organization to continue its work towards \npeacemaking, peacebuilding and conflict prevention, \nparticularly with regard to new and emerging threats. \nOn my country\u2019s behalf, I want to assure the Assembly \nthat we will continue to offer any help deemed necessary \nto achieve those noble objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, I extend \nwarm congratulations to you, Sir, the Minister for \nForeign Affairs of Uganda, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. My delegation reaffirms the core function of \nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative body on \nall global issues. We look forward to working with you \nin \u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative \npost-2015 development agenda\u201d, which is the theme that \nyou have chosen for this session.\n\nMy delegation pays tribute to your predecessor, \nMr. John Ashe, who has done a sterling job in setting \nthe stage for a post-2015 development agenda. Under \nhis watch, he convened four high-level events and \ntwo thematic debates in shaping the new development \nparadigm. President Ashe also guided the work of \nthe Open Working Group of the General Assembly \non Sustainable Development Goals in developing \nuniversal sustainable development goals (SDGs). \nToday, we have 17 carefully crafted and delicately \n\nbalanced SDGs, accompanied by 169 targets. A means \nof implementation is attached to each goal, which, if \nhonoured, will trigger a seismic shift in the way that \nwe do business.\n\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General\u2019s post-\n2015 synthesis report later this year. That report will \nprovide a structure for our post-2015 negotiations. My \ndelegation is mindful of the fact that the outcome of \nthe third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, scheduled for mid-2015, will feed into \nthe negotiation process. Solomon Islands commits itself \nto ensuring that our people own and buy into the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nThe Solomon Islands\u2019 scorecard on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) remains mixed across all \neight Goals. We are on track for achieving some of them, \noff track for others and in the process for three Goals. \nHowever, we remain committed to consolidating our \nMDG gains and are beginning to build the foundation \nfor integrating a new development agenda nationally at \nall levels.\n\nIf sustainable development is to grow roots in any \ncountry, it needs to be nurtured in a politically stable \nenvironment. The Solomon Islands National Parliament \npassed the Political Party Integrity Bill in May. The act \nallows political parties to develop and to operate in a \nregulated and systematic manner, thereby instilling a \npredictable and stable political atmosphere, which is an \nessential condition for development.\n\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that, under the \nleadership of the Prime Minister, the Honourable Gordon \nDarcy Lilo, the ninth Solomon Islands Parliament \nconcluded its four-year term early this month. As the \npeople anxiously look forward to exercising their right \nto vote in the forthcoming national general election, we \nwill do so using the biometric voter system for the first \ntime. As a young democratic State, we are constantly \nimproving our governance system and correcting past \nelection irregularities. We could not have achieved that \nwithout international support and partnership. To our \npartners, I convey once again the deep appreciation and \ngratitude of Solomon Islands.\n\nSolomon Islands would also like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate both Fiji and New Zealand \non their newly elected Governments and Parliaments. \nWe stand ready to strengthen our bilateral relations \nwith our two neighbours and to address issues of \nmutual concern. We also convey our best wishes to the \nKingdom of Tonga for its November national general \nelections.\n\nSolomon Islands has continued to serve on the \nExecutive Board of UN-Women. Gender-based \nviolence is a major economic leakage in any country\u2019s \ndevelopment. It reduces women\u2019s productivity in all \nthree dimensions of sustainable development. Gender-\nbased violence also imposes a cost on the wider society. \nLast month, the Solomon Islands National Parliament \nmet its international obligation under the Committee \non the Elimination of Discrimination against Women \nand adopted family protection legislation. The act \nprotects families from domestic violence, deals with \nperpetrators and provides practical support to victims \nof violence. The legislation has received strong national \nvisibility and promotes gender equality. Solomon \nIslands wishes to acknowledge UN-Women\u2019s Markets \nfor Change project in the country. The project aims to \nimprove market governance and on-site services for \nwomen. It recognizes and addresses our rural women\u2019s \nchallenges and will, hopefully, encourage more women \nto engage in economic activities.\n\nThe year 2015 marks the twentieth anniversary \nof the Platform for Action of the Fourth World \nConference on Women. Solomon Islands conducted a \nnational review on its implementation of the Beijing \nPlatform for Action and has identified three areas of \nachievements: recognition of gender equality, the \neconomic empowerment of women and awareness of \ngender-based violence. We believe in the notion that \nprogress for women is progress for all. We remain \ncommitted to implementing the Platform for Action.\n\nThe third International Conference on Small \nIslands Developing States (SIDS), convened in Samoa, \nreaffirmed SIDS as a special case for sustainable \ndevelopment given their unique and particular \nvulnerability. The once-in-a-decade Conference \nadopted the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \nPathway, which outlines 19 priority areas. The \noutcome document (A/CONF.223/3, annex) calls for \na comprehensive review of United Nations support to \nSIDS.\n\nIn that connection, Solomon Islands seeks closer \nrelations with the United Nations. We would like \nto see the United Nations Development Programme \nSubregional Office in Solomon Islands upgraded to \nthe status of country office. After more than three \ndecades of the United Nations managing Solomon \n\nIslands relations from abroad, it is time to invest in \nsuch relations in my capital.\n\nWith regard to a related matter, Solomon Islands \ncontinues to be underrepresented in the composition of \nUnited Nations staff. However, we are grateful for and \nwelcome the United Nations annual recruitment drive \nin Solomon Islands and hope to fill our employment \nquota soon, with Solomon islanders joining the diverse \nUnited Nations staff.\n\nHealth remains a precondition for sustainable \ndevelopment. Solomon Islands has continued to \ndemonstrate its commitment to improving the health of \nits people. In July, the first 20 Solomon Islands doctors \ngraduated from medical schools in Cuba. Solomon \nIslands would like to thank Cuba for the scholarships \nawarded to the doctors, as well as to the remaining 80 \nSolomon Islands medical students. This year alone, \nwe will witness more than 30 new doctors joining our \nhealth services. It is the vision of the Government to \ndouble the number of doctors in the country in the \nnext two years, to continue to strengthen our health-\ncare infrastructure, putting in place health and social \nprotection systems, and to work towards making health-\ncare coverage in Solomon Islands universal.\n\nSolomon Islands joins the international community \nin calling for the lifting of the economic and financial \nblockade imposed on Cuba by our friend and partner, \nthe United States of America. After more than five \ndecades of sanctions on Cuba, it is time to reset \nrelations between the two neighbours on the basis of \ngood-neighbourly relations and respect for territorial \nintegrity and political sovereignty.\n\nOne of the principles of the SDGs is that we \nmust not leave anyone behind. There are States \nknocking at the door of the United Nations, ready to \ntake on multilateral responsibilities. The Republic of \nChina on Taiwan continues to seek full and effective \nparticipation with three United Nations specialized \nbodies, namely, the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) and the International Civil \nAviation Organization (ICAO).\n\nThose United Nations bodies deal with urgent \nglobal issues in which we all have an interest \u2014 from \nclimate change to the evolving health challenges. ICAO \nworks to keep our travelling public and air services \nsafe. I wish to note that 45 million passengers passed \nthrough the Republic of China, Taiwan, in 2012. We \ndo not have the luxury of time to turn a blind eye to \nthe required cooperation. The global challenges before \nus are too great for narrow interests to adopt a wait-\nand-see approach and to keep postponing action that \nis needed.\n\nThe Republic of China, Taiwan, is a country that \nhas transformed itself from a developing country into \nan industrialized one. It is the twenty-seventh-largest \neconomy in the world and has experience, technology \nand capability from which our shared agenda can \nbenefit. We have all to gain and nothing to lose by \ninviting the Republic of China, Taiwan, to become the \n195th member of the UNFCCC, the 192nd member of \nICAO and the 195th member of the WHO.\n\nThe Solomon Islands partnership with the Pacific \nIslands Forum, under the Regional Assistance Mission \nto the Solomon Islands, continues to create positive \nconditions, allowing the country to begin a limited \nrearmament of its police force. The private sector \nand the international community have responded to \nthe changing environment, with the European Union \nupgrading its representation in my capital, Honiara, \nand more and more non-traditional partners accrediting \ntheir envoys to Solomon Islands. A new commercial \nbank was incorporated and entered the Solomon \nIslands market, making it the fourth commercial bank \nto provide financial services to our vibrant population.\n\nSustainable development for Solomon Islands, as \na coastal State, includes its seabed resources beyond \nits 1.3-million-square-kilometre exclusive economic \nzone. The Solomon Islands has registered a number \nof continental shelf claims with the United Nations \nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \n(CLCS). My delegation is pleased to see that one of the \nclaims is now being examined by the Subcommission of \nthe CLCS. We look forward to further engagement with \nthe Subcommission during the course of this session.\n\nThe world is facing a series of crisis and conflicts \nin Africa, the Middle East and now in Europe. In \ndealing with conflicts, we must exert greater effort in \nseeking the peaceful settlement of disputes. We must \ncollectively counter extremism, terrorism and crimes \nagainst humanity, and protect civilians, operating \nwithin the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United \nNations.\n\nAs the principal organ of the United Nations for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \nthe Security Council must be part of that solution. \n\n\nDespite the call of world leaders for the speedy reform \nof the Security Council in 2005, nine years on we \nare still working at it. At the tenth intergovernmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform in July, there \nwas overwhelming support for the expansion of Security \nCouncil membership and for making the Council more \nrepresentative and accountable in terms of improving \nits working methods. An advisory group mandated by \nyour predecessor, Mr. President, produced a non-paper. \nIt provided structure to the last session\u2019s discussions \nand can be used as a basis for negotiations during this \nsession. We look to you for leadership on that.\n\nTurning now to the recent outbreak of Ebola, \nthe gravity, scale and spread of the Ebola virus in \nWest Africa is unprecedented and demands urgent \ninternational cooperation. The Ebola disease has halted \nservices and disrupted the lives of many people in \nthe affected countries. The Solomon Islands supports \nour Secretary-General\u2019s action to establish the United \nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, \nand acknowledges global efforts in mobilization of \nresources to combat the disease as a matter of urgency.\n\nAs stated by other delegations, decolonization \nremains an unfinished business of the United Nations. \nIf we are to deliver on the Third International Decade \nfor the Eradication of Colonialism, we will need the \ncooperation of all parties \u2014 including the administering \nPowers, the Non-Self-Governing Territories, and \nregional and subregional organizations \u2014 to honour \ntheir commitments under the Charter of the United \nNations and the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of \nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n\nThe Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG), made \nup of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Solomon \nIslands and the Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale kanak \nsocialiste, continues to follow the question of New \nCaledonia in the United Nations Special Committee \non Decolonization (Committee of 24). The Group \nwelcomed the Committee\u2019s visit to New Caledonia \nin March, and noted its concerns relating to the \nTerritory\u2019s electoral process and needed legislation in \nkeeping within the spirit of the Noum\u00e9a Accord. Those \nissues have implications in preparing for a credible \nreferendum process, consistent and in conformity with \nthe universally accepted principles and practices of \nself-determination, as defined by resolution 1514 (XV) \nand other relevant resolutions of the Assembly.\n\nMy delegation would also like to acknowledge the \ndiligent work of the Committee of 24 in examining the \nquestion of French Polynesia. Solomon Islands continues \nto reaffirm its support for the inalienable rights of the \npeople of French Polynesia to self-determination, in \naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. It is \nour hope that the Decolonization Committee will soon \nvisit the Non-Self-Governing Territory, in cooperation \nwith the administering Power.\n\nSolomon Islands, as a member of the MSG, is \nworking in collaboration with Indonesia on human \nrights concerns in Papua and West Papua, the two \neasternmost provinces of the Republic of Indonesia. \nOn 21 May, Solomon Islands established its Embassy \nin Jakarta with the genuine intention of continuing to \ncooperate with Indonesia on many important issues of \nmutual concern, including those taken up together by \nMSG members.\n\nSolomon Islands welcomes the World Conference \non Indigenous People. More than 90 per cent of our \npopulation are indigenous Melanesians and Polynesians \nspeaking more than 87 different languages. Our diverse \ncultures are under threat due to forced relocation from \nancestral lands as a result of sea-level rise. Their right \nto live in harmony with nature is being threatened by \nthe declining health of the planet.\n\nClimate change remains the greatest challenge of \nour time. It calls for the widest possible international \ncooperation on the part of all. This month, Solomon \nIslands ratified the second commitment period under \nthe Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We \nencourage parties to the Protocol that have not ratified \nthe amendment to do so as soon as possible. It is in \nour collective interest to see the Protocol enforced. \nWe remain deeply concerned on the slow progress of \nclimate-change negotiations, and hope that the General \nAssembly will invite the UNFCCC to conduct its \nnegotiations in New York, where diplomats from all \nparties to the Convention are located all year round. We \nneed to accelerate the pace of negotiations. This must \nbe done while working with our technical experts in \nthe process.\n\nIn looking at the 2015 Climate Change agreement, \nSolomon Islands would like to see a credible agreement \nthat will guarantee the survival of the SIDS and the \nleast developed countries (LDCs). The agreement must \nbe comprehensive in scope, addressing mitigation, \nadaptation, finance and technology transfer. It must be \ninclusive, and respect and respond to the special needs \nof SIDS and LDCs. The agreement must be flexible \n\nenough to respond to the changing science and be \nadequately resourced.\n\nClimate-change risk remains at the forefront of \nour sustainable development path. The flash floods of \ngreat magnitude and intensity that occurred in Solomon \nIslands in April claimed lives and destroyed homes and \ninfrastructure. Damages and losses are equivalent to \n9.2 per cent of Solomon Islands\u2019 gross domestic product. \nThis has created pressure in the form of new expenses, \nprompting the Government to borrow and secure \ngrants externally. Solomon Islands remains grateful \nto its neighbours \u2014 Australia, New Zealand, Nauru, \nTuvalu, Samoa and Papua New Guinea \u2014 as well as \nTurkey, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Botswana, \nSri Lanka and the Republic of China on Taiwan, among \nothers, that have supported our national rehabilitation \nand recovery efforts.\n\nDespite the disaster challenges, Solomon Islands \nremains determined to build a resilient society. We \nare on track in building two hydro-projects in two \nprovinces, in partnership with the World Bank and the \nAsian Development Bank. In partnership with Japan, \nwe are expanding our port facilities to promote and \nenable domestic, regional and international trade. I am \npleased to say that, since the sixty-eighth session, a \nnumber of domestic airports and 18 bridges have been \nconstructed, further uniting our scattered population. \nThis would not have been possible without the support \nof Australia, New Zealand and the European Union, \nand we express our gratitude to our traditional partners.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) confirms that, without additional mitigation \nactions, we are heading towards a 3.7-4.8\u00b0C world. The \nfifth IPCC assessment report indicates that by 2030, \n89 per cent of coral reefs are projected to experience \nsevere coral bleaching, with the temperature increasing \nby 1.5\u00b0C. By 2050, at 2\u00b0C we are looking at 100 per \ncent coral reef bleaching. These developments will \noccur in our generation and will have an impact on \ntourism industries and fish stocks, potentially driving \nhouseholds in the SIDS and LDCs into poverty traps.\n\nWe call on the international community to respect \nthe principles of fairness and justice and to put SIDS \nand LDCs at the heart of international cooperation. In \nthat connection, my delegation welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Climate Summit, held last week. We also \nsupport your proposal, Mr. President, of convening a \nhigh-level debate on climate change during the course \nof this session. We do so because our lives depend on it.\n\nLet me conclude by reaffirming the commitment \nof the Solomon Islands to striving for a just, equitable \nand inclusive world. Implementing the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda provides us with our first and last \nline of defence in guaranteeing a sustainable future for \nour current and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I wish to extend heartiest congratulations to \nthe President on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Antigua and \nBarbuda looks forward to his leadership and guidance \nthroughout this session. I also offer congratulations \nto his predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador John \nAshe, on a job well done and on his unrelenting service \nto the United Nations community, particularly small \nisland developing States.\n\nI stand before the Assembly as, perhaps, the newest \nHead of Government at this sixty-ninth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. The political party that I have the \nhonour to lead was democratically and overwhelmingly \nelected as the Government of Antigua and Barbuda a \nlittle more than three months ago. I am probably also \namong the youngest of the Heads of Government at \nthis gathering. However, although I may be relatively \nyoung and my Government new, I have been a steadfast \nbeliever in the value of the United Nations from the \nfirst moment of my adult consciousness. The idea \nthat there could be a world without a machinery for \nleaders to gather in one place, with the single purpose \nof improving the lives of all humankind, conjures \nup images of chaos, carnage and catastrophe too \nfrightening to contemplate. While some may argue that \nthe United Nations has not always lived up to its noble \npurposes and that chaos, carnage and catastrophe have \nscarred our planet, I am profoundly aware that, without \nthe United Nations, the viciousness and the wounds \nwould have been significantly worse.\n\nHowever, even as I rejoice in the existence of the \nUnited Nations, I also lament that its largest and most \npowerful nations have too often used their privileged \npositions to weaken the authority of the Organization in \nadvancement of their own narrow interests. It has also \nbeen a grave sadness that in the past powerful States \nhave circumvented this body in pursuit of their national \ngoals, even in defiance of the solidarity of the larger \nfamily of nations.\n\nFor those reasons, my Government and the people \nof Antigua and Barbuda strongly support the reform \nof the Organization. We would like to see reform \nthat democratizes the United Nations so as to give a \ngreater voice to those countries, such as mine, that \nare marginalized in decision-making because we are \nconsidered too small to make a difference. We would \nalso welcome a comprehensive reform of the Security \nCouncil that ends the anachronism of the veto power \nof the five permanent members \u2014 a system that has no \nlegitimacy in fairness and in the global balance and that \nhas often prevented the Security Council from acting in \na manner that would command worldwide support and \nacclamation.\n\nIt is paradoxical that such nations, particularly \nthose that most fiercely advocate respect for democracy \nand the rule of law, implement those principles at home \nbut decline to implement them abroad. Respect for the \nrule of law and for the democratic principle that gives \nnations rights that are as inalienable as those of the \nindividual in powerful States must become integral to \nthe process and systems of governance by which the \nworld\u2019s affairs are managed. Indeed, small States, such \nas mine, rely on the strength of the United Nations and \non international respect for democracy and the rule of \nlaw to protect us from incursions on our sovereignty and \ndisregard for our rights. Centuries ago, the philosopher \nAristotle spoke a compelling truth when he said of the \nState:\n\n\u201cA State is not a mere society, having a common \nplace, established for the prevention of mutual \ncrime and for the sake of exchange ... Political \nsociety exists for the sake of noble actions, and not \nof mere companionship.\u201d\nAristotle\u2019s observation concerning the State \nremains valid and legitimate in today\u2019s international \nsystem of States, which the United Nations represents. \nEvery State within the international system must \nrecognize that noble action is one of the purposes of a \npolitical community.\n\nIn this regard, I draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to \nthe fact that 10 long years have passed since my small \ncountry, with a population of under 100,000 and an \neconomy of $1.1 billion, received a favourable decision \nby the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) in a complaint against the United \nStates, a nation of several hundred million inhabitants \nwhose economy is valued in the trillions. Despite the \nfavourable judgment, against which the losing party has \nappealed without success, the United States Government \nhas not seen fit to perform the \u201cnoble action\u201d of settling \nwith my small State in a manner consistent with the \nharm done to our economy. My country has been \ndenied income that, had we continued to earn it, would \nhave contributed significantly to the welfare of my \npeople, and to the capacity of our economy to cope with \nthe grave effects of climate change and the financial \ncrisis to which we became a casualty. I stress that when \nmy country took the United States before the WTO\u2019s \nDispute Settlement Body, we did not do so as an act of \nhostility to a neighbour with whom we have enjoyed a \nlong and friendly relationship; we did so because we \nhad a duty to care for our people.\n\nMy small State was the victim of a trade violation. \nIn good faith, we sought relief within the international \nsystem and the democratic principles and rule of law \nthat it is meant to uphold. To be fair, the system delivered \njustice. But in so doing, its weakness was exposed when \njustice could not be enforced because the powerful \nparty that was found against would not settle with the \nsmall country that was injured. However, if democracy \nand the rule of law are to prevail in our international \nsystem, they have to be upheld and respected by the \npowerful and cannot simply be imposed upon the weak. \nOtherwise, there will be resentment, discontent and \npossibly conflict.\n\nYesterday, speaking in this very forum, the \nPresident of the United States, Barack Obama, said \nthat \u201cright makes might... bigger nations should not be \nable to bully smaller ones\u201d (A/69/PV.6, p. 11). If this \nuniversal truth is a guiding principle of his Government, \nthen the United States cannot continue to approbate and \nreprobate on this principle. The noble thing is for the \nUnited States to settle this long-outstanding judgement \nfairly and expeditiously. In another context, but voicing \na similar principle, President Obama said the following \na year ago: \n\n\u201c[T]he principle of sovereignty is at the centre of \nour international order. But sovereignty cannot \nbe ... an excuse for the international community to \nturn a blind eye\u201d (A/68/PV.5, p. 16). \nPresident Obama was perfectly right. That is why I \nbelieve he will agree that sovereignty and power should \nnot be a shield against the fulfilment of obligations \nindependently assessed, or an excuse for not settling \nthis very vexing issue.\nI am sure that President Obama would also agree \nthat the international community cannot turn a blind \neye to the blockade imposed on Cuba. Antigua and \nBarbuda supports the preservation of the sovereignty \nof every nation. We are very proud of our long-standing \nrelationship with the Republic of Cuba. We therefore \njoin with the international community and condemn any \ndiscriminatory and retaliatory policies and practices \nthat serve to prevent Cuba from exercising its right \nto freely participate in the affairs of the hemisphere. \nMy Government firmly believes that any application \nof unilateral and extraterritorial coercive laws and \nmeasures that conflict with international law and the \nprinciples of free navigation and international trade is \nwrong. We therefore urge our long-standing friend, the \nUnited States, to respect and take note of the numerous \ncalls by the United Nations to immediately bring an \nend to the unjust economic, commercial and financial \nblockade imposed on our neighbour Cuba.\n\nMy small country has no military might, no \neconomic clout. All that we have is membership of the \ninternational system as our shield and our voice in this \nbody as our sword. That is why we will continue to \nuphold the value of the United Nations vigorously, and \nwhy we will join the effort for its reform to make it the \nguardian of all nations and all peoples.\n\nI want to express my Government\u2019s full agreement \nwith the President\u2019s decision to make the theme of \nthis General Assembly debate, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda.\u201d It is well known now that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Gap Task Force has reported \nmixed progress in the achievement of key targets. \nAmong the targets on which there has been insufficient \nacceleration has been official development assistance. \nI congratulate those countries that have reached the \npledged target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. \nHowever, the developed world is still not meeting the \ntarget of $315 billion. Indeed, it is not even reaching \nhalf that amount.\n\nMy own country and the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) region as a whole have witnessed a decline \nin bilateral assistance from larger and richer nations \nwithin our own hemisphere, and we have relied on \nnon-traditional sources, such as the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \nIn regard to energy, the high cost of which cripples \nour country, the Venezuelan Petrocaribe arrangement \nhas been a lifebelt in a sea of turbulence. We are also \ngrateful for the contributions of our other international \npartners, including the European Union. However, as we \ngo forward, there is clearly a need for increased global \nengagement with respect to development assistance, \nincluding the presence at the table of recipients as well \nas donors.\n\nIn addition \u2014 and as a most urgent matter \u2014 the \ninternational financial institutions must be urged to stop \npenalizing small Caribbean States on the basis of their \nflawed per capita income criterion. Our countries are \ndenied access to concessional financing because we are \nclassified as middle-income countries. This obdurate \nattitude of the international financial institutions in \nnot devising better criteria for assessing the eligibility \nof our small economies for concessionary financing, \nforces us into the commercial lending market. The \nconsequence of this is that our debt is rising and many \nof us are among the most highly indebted countries in \nthe world on a per capita basis.\n\nBut I ask, \u201cWhat is the alternative?\u201d Rhetorically, \nI ask again, \u201cWhat is the alternative?\u201d It is said that \nsix years after the global economy collapsed, jobs are \nbeing created, global financial systems have stabilized \nand people are once again being lifted out of poverty. \nBut I say here this afternoon that this is not a universal \ntruth. In the case of small States in the Caribbean, the \nglobal economic crisis in 2008 in whose creation we \nplayed no part, sent our economies into a tailspin. We \nhave yet to recover fully from its impact, and we will \nprobably never recover the development ground that we \nlost. Incredibly, a significant number of our educated \nyoung people are unemployed. If we fail to satisfy their \naspirations, we condemn them to a life on the margins of \nsociety at best, or a life of crime and violence at worst. \nNo nation can opt for so devastating an alternative.\n\nThere is now an urgent need for this United \nNations body, through one of its appropriate organs, to \naddress the large debt that CARICOM countries have \naccumulated owing to declining aid, poor terms of \ntrade, the high cost of regulating financial services, and \n\n\nexpenditure on curbing drug trafficking and stopping \nrefugees.\n\nThose countries in the Caribbean, including my \nown, that are now increasing their debt are not doing so \nbecause of poor policies or because we are not focused \non increased productivity and growth, nor are we doing \nso because of high expenditures on vanity projects or \nunsustainable ventures. We are doing so to build the \nsocioeconomic infrastructure to facilitate revenue \ngeneration.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the global crisis that \nbegan in 2008 has set our economies back to pre-1974 \nlevels. While we are tightening our belts, forging \nrelations with the private sector and energetically \nseeking foreign direct investment in productive \nenterprises, we are scraping our way uphill, having \nbeen pushed downwards by a deluge of external factors.\n\nThe United Nations cannot step back from those \nrealities, and it would be wrong, as it has been wrong \nfor some time, for this Organization to abdicate its \nresponsibility for action to multilateral organizations \nwhose membership is made up only of a few, however \npowerful they may be. Indeed, it is precisely because \nthe members of those groups are powerful and because \nthey reach into a network of economic and political \ndecision-making bodies that can easily impose their \nwill on the weak and vulnerable that the United Nations \nshould not abandon its responsibilities to the weak, who \ndepend on this Organization.\n\nI cannot leave this rostrum without addressing the \nwar on terror and the issue of the dreaded Ebola disease. \nThe threat of Ebola requires a global response, and we \nurge the international community to act collectively \nand swiftly in combatting what could become a global \npandemic with grave socio-economic consequences for \nsmall States, especially our fragile, tourism-dependent \ncountries in the Caribbean. Antigua and Barbuda \ncommends the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for \nits pledge of $5 million towards Ebola eradication and \nthe Republic of Cuba for sending 165 doctors. We call \non the members of the international community to \ncontinue to contribute towards that effort.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda condemns the savage and \ncruel acts of the jihadists of the Islamic State, who have \nbeheaded three civilians. On behalf of the Government \nand people of Antigua and Barbuda, I express our \ndeepest sympathy to the families of the victims and \nto the people of the United States, France and the \nUnited Kingdom for those atrocities. There can be no \njustification for such barbaric behaviour. We cannot \nafford a world that slips back into the dark ages when \nviolence, wars and barbarism were the stock-and-trade \nof religious intolerance and ethnic divisions.\n\nYet, as we survey the global scene, there are deeply \ntroubling instances of such behaviour in Europe, Africa \nand the Middle East. In all this, the role of the United \nNations becomes critically important. What is required \nis not unilateral acts that will embroil specific nations \nin cycles of violent retaliation. What is required is a \nUnited Nations whose Member States, particularly \nthose on the Security Council, act together to defend \npeace and security.\n\nAfter only 100 days in office, my Government \nhas demonstrated its commitment to building an all-\ninclusive, all-empowering and egalitarian society by \npromoting the protection of women\u2019s rights, gender \nequality and the rights of the disabled. We see those \nissues not only as human rights issues, but as essential \ncomponents of sustainable development, peace, social \njustice and security. At our first session of Parliament, \nmy Government ratified the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities. We have gone further and \nhave appointed a distinguished son of the soil, who is \nvisually challenged, to serve as our representative to \nthe United Nations. We have also appointed a plethora \nof women to serve in the Upper House of Parliament \nas ambassadors and in other key positions within \nthe public sector. It is my Government\u2019s pledge to \ncontinue to work towards full gender equality and the \nadvancement and empowerment of women.\n\nWhen the President of the General Assembly opened \nthe Assembly\u2019s sixty-ninth session, he remarked that \n\u201cto say that we are living in tumultuous times would \nseem an understatement\u201d (A/69/PV.1, p. 3). He noted that \nthe entire world is facing challenges such as poverty, \nhunger, climate change and rising sea levels, persistent \nunemployment, armed conflicts and the Ebola virus \nepidemic. He called on this global body to tackle those \nchallenges \u201cwith dedication, single-mindedness of \npurpose and compromise\u201d and \u201ca sense of resolve and \nresilience\u201d (ibid.) He was right to do so.\n\nCrises are staring human civilization in the face, \nincluding climate change, the Ebola virus and the threat \nposed by the Islamic State. As a result, we all face a \nfuture where those challenges can only be dealt with \nthrough joint international action. The United Nations, \n\n\nthe parliament of parliaments, is the place where such \njoint action is to be decided and implemented. We need \nto strengthen the United Nations capacity for such \naction, whether military or humanitarian. There is no \nsubstitute for the United Nations. Antigua and Barbuda \npledges its continued support of and participation in the \nwork of the United Nations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is \nmy great pleasure to endorse the warm congratulations \nextended to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the \nresponsible post of President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. I take this opportunity to \nexpress gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his important \ncontribution to the work of the General Assembly at its \nprior session.\n\nMy delegation shares the determination to \neradicate hunger and poverty and to promote progress \nin elaborating the post-2015 development agenda. \nIn our view, the post-2015 development agenda must \nbe based on the foundation of the development goals \nformulated in the Millennium Declaration (resolution \n55/2) and envisage ways and means of responding to the \nchallenges of a new generation.\n\nThe main goal of the post-2015 development agenda \nshould be the eradication of poverty and inequality, \nas well as promoting sustainable development based \non balanced consideration of social, economic and \nenvironmental factors. The sustainable development \ngoals, based on the three pillars of sustainable \ndevelopment, the Rio de Janeiro principles and national \nspecificities and priorities, should serve as the key \ncomponents of the post-2015 development agenda. In \nthat respect, we support the recommendations of the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals. Experience has shown that a goal can be \nachieved only if specific plans are complemented by \nthe development of effective mechanisms for its review \nand implementation. Our hope is that this forum will \nbecome an important venue for ongoing dialogue \nand review of the implementation of the sustainable \ndevelopment goals.\n\nAddressing issues concerning the financing \nof sustainable development efforts is equally \nimportant in achieving sustainable development. \nGlobal partnerships for development based on the \nMillennium Declaration have contributed to a certain \nextent towards the achievement of a number of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, \ngaps and flaws in global partnerships continue to cause \nadditional difficulties on the path towards full and \ntimely implementation of the MDGs.\n\nWe consider it necessary to strengthen and expand \nglobal partnerships in accordance with previous \ncommitments. On that basis, new global partnerships \nshould be established for the benefit of sustainable \ndevelopment, which will become the key element of the \nglobal system of promoting and advancing sustainable \ndevelopment. In that regard, we note the key importance \nof the recommendations of the Intergovernmental \nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \nFinancing, the intergovernmental process tasked with \ndiscussing proposals to establish a United Nations \nmechanism to promote development and technology \ntransfer.\n\nTajikistan has consistently strengthened its efforts \nto achieve the MDGs. Extra measures have been \nundertaken to create a favourable investment climate, \nincluding a balanced budget policy, diversifying the \neconomy and increasing employment opportunities.\nThe National Development Strategy of the Republic of \nTajikistan up to 2015 is a road map for the Government \nto achieve sustainable economic growth, to provide the \npopulation with better access to basic social services \nand to reduce poverty.\n\nAs a result of such measures to ensure economic \ngrowth, in recent years we have managed to significantly \nreduce the level of poverty in the country. As a United \nNations pilot country for the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals, we plan to carry out \na comprehensive review of the implementation of those \nGoals in Tajikistan in 2015. The lessons learned from \nthe implementation of the MDGs will be taken into \naccount during the development of a new programme of \nsustainable development for the period up to 2030. We \nare willing to closely cooperate in a transparent way \nwith United Nations agencies and programmes, partner \ncountries and other relevant organizations.\n\nAs members may be aware, on 22 March 2005, \nin New York, we saw the launch of the International \nDecade for Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, 2005-2015, which \npromoted the coordinated implementation of the MDGs. \nThe International Decade provided a strong impetus \nfor various initiatives and efforts at different levels to \npromote access to safe drinking water and sanitation, to \nadvance the integrated management of water resources, \nto strengthen and expand water cooperation and to raise \nawareness of water-related challenges.\n\nAt the same time, global climate change, increasing \neconomic growth, higher population levels, the \ndegradation of water sources and the deteriorating \nquality of water resources present the international \ncommunity with additional extensive challenges. The \nreduction in water resources as a result of climate \nchange may impede the achievement of sustainable \ndevelopment and aggravate the situation, in particular \nin arid and semi-arid regions, which continue to \nexperience the greatest water shortages.\n\nThe International Year of Water Cooperation, \nwhich took place last year in the context of promoting \nthe International Decade of Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, \n2005-2015, underscored the need for water resources \nmanagement to be regulated on the basis of the \nprinciple of joint development, which provides for a \nbroad framework for the harmonization of interests \nand the strengthening of mutual trust in addressing \nwater issues. On the basis of the principle of joint \ndevelopment, water resources management could ensure \nthe sustainable management of water resources, which \nis a key component of sustainable development. In that \nregard, we propose conducting a comprehensive review \nof the implementation of the International Decade \nof Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, 2005-2015, and jointly \ndeveloping specific recommendations to strengthen \nand revitalize the United Nations water agenda.\n\nWe believe access to modern and affordable energy \nservices to be a key priority for achieving sustainable \ndevelopment. Tajikistan continues to consistently and \ncomprehensively develop its energy potential, focusing \non the integrated development of renewable sources. \nIn addition to the construction of small- and medium-\nscale hydropower plants, larger regional projects are \nbeing developed. We are also exploring opportunities \nfor the use of wind and solar energy. Through such \nprojects, Tajikistan is significantly and specifically \ncontributing to the reduction of harmful emissions \nand to the establishment of a solid foundation for \nsustainable development. I would like to take this \nopportunity to underscore that all those projects are \nbeing implemented in a transparent way, with due \nconsideration for the social, economic and ecological \naspects of the sustainable development of the country \nand the entire region.\n\nTajikistan supports the holding of the Ten-Year \nReview Conference on the Implementation of the \nAlmaty Programme of Action on 3 to 5 November \nin Vienna. We believe that the new programme of \naction for the landlocked least developed countries \nwill provide additional opportunities for the further \n\n\nintegration of such countries into the world economy. \nWe should support and encourage as much as possible \nway the efforts of that group of countries to expand \nand to improve transport and energy infrastructure, the \ndiversification of the economy and the streamlining of \nregional and interregional connectivity.\n\nWhile the Organization\u2019s transformative agenda \nprovides unique opportunities, unfortunately, it also \ntends to strengthen the interlinkage between today\u2019s \nthreats and challenges. It is in the common interests of \nMember States to consistently implement the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and to \neffectively counter terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations, including the use of the Internet for the \npurpose of terror.\n\nIllicit drug production and drug trafficking are \nalso serious global issues. In recent decades, Tajikistan \nhas gained extensive experience in combating drug \ntrafficking. Under the country\u2019s President, the Drug \nControl Agency has been functioning successfully for \n15 years. We have been actively strengthening counter-\nnarcotics cooperation with neighbouring States, \nincluding within regional organizations. At the initiative \nof the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Emomali \nRahmon, Dushanbe will host a regional anti-narcotics \nconference in 2015, a year before the special session of \nthe General Assembly on the world drug problem. The \nproposals of the conference participants will jointly \nhelp to develop a new international counter-narcotics \npolicy. We look forward to the support of the United \nNations, relevant States and international organizations \nfor that conference.\n\nIn that regard, we attach great significance to \ncoordinated and joint efforts with Afghanistan in \ncombating drugs, as well as on other issues. The \nfriendly Islamic State of Afghanistan is facing new \nchallenges and expects the appropriate support from \nthe international community. We are convinced that \nthe fraternal Afghan people, with the support of the \ncommunity of nations, will be able to successfully \naddress the difficulties facing them. We believe that, \nin the current circumstances, the United Nations must \ntake the lead in coordinating international efforts for \nthe resolution of the question of Afghanistan.\n\nTajikistan believes that Afghanistan must be fully \ninvolved in the multifaceted regional cooperation \nprocess. It is critical to fully include Afghanistan \nin the multifaceted regional cooperation processes. \nThe involvement of neighbouring countries in the \ndevelopment of Afghanistan, while taking into account \nthe regional context in the post-conflict rehabilitation \nof the country, is key to the success of the ongoing \nefforts of the international community.\n\nIn our view, strengthening lasting peace and \nstability in conflict and post-conflict situations \nrequires genuine assistance in addressing economic \nand social issues and support for efforts to restore \neffective Government institutions and a sustainable \nbasis for long-term development. The regional \nmultilateral structures must actively participate in \nstrengthening security and stability, in implementing \nlarge-scale infrastructure projects and programmes and \nin expanding constructive and concrete cooperation \nand interaction.\n\nIn early September, Dushanbe, the capital of \nTajikistan, hosted the fourteenth summit of the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization (SCO). The heads of the SCO \nmember States called for the strengthening of regional \ncooperation, joint development and mutual prosperity. \nThey adopted measures on the liberalization of trade \nand investment and the improvement of transport and \ncommunications systems and on ensuring food and \nenergy security. They also addressed other urgent \nregional issues of fundamental interest to our people.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that it is \nimpossible to resolve the issues facing the General \nAssembly without strengthening, reforming, \nrationalizing and updating the entire United Nations \nsystem. Comprehensive reform of the United Nations \nshould contribute to its strengthening and the \nenhancement of its capacity to respond to the latest \ndevelopments in the world in a timely and adequate \nmanner and to meet modern challenges and counteract \nmodern threats. The current Assembly session provides \na unique opportunity for the search of joint coordinated \nways of addressing pressing issues, which we need take \nfull advantage of.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on \nbeing elected as the President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. We wish you success and \nassure you of our fullest cooperation.\n\nThe theme for this session \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d, is timely. The world has undergone many \nchanges since the United Nations was created, and \nsince the year 2000 much progress has been made \ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \nHowever, there are multiple challenges that still remain \nto be addressed. The moral and practical importance of \ncreating an equitable world and a sustainable planet for \nthis purpose cannot be ignored.\n\nThe Commonwealth, of which Sri Lanka is the current \nChair-in-Office, accounts for more than one-quarter \nof the United Nations membership. In November 2013 \nthe Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed \nin Colombo to contribute to the process of evolving \nthe new post-2015 global development agenda. They \nhave endorsed the central focus on the eradication \nof extreme poverty and reaffirmed commitments to \nsustainable development. The perspective on the post-\n2015 development agenda is based on shared values \nand principles contained in the Commonwealth Charter \nand individual experiences. The Commonwealth \nleaders encourage others to approach the forthcoming \nintergovernmental negotiations in a collaborative spirit \nto achieve a balanced post-2015 development agenda.\n\nReducing inequality within and among countries \nis one of the most transformative goals that have been \nproposed by the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. We hope that this goal will serve \nto enhance the voice and representation of developing \ncountries in decision-making. The post-2015 agenda \nmust focus on implementation. Achieving the \nsustainable development goals would be impossible \nwithout the political will and dedication of all countries. \nIt must be ensured that the failure of the developed \ncountries to fulfil Millennium Goal 8 that called for a \nglobal partnership for development is not repeated. \n\nIn determining goals, countries must not be \ndeprived of policy space to set their own domestic \npriorities. Instead of asking countries to reprioritize \ndomestic spending, the focus should be on a \nstrengthened partnership between developed and \ndeveloping countries, backed by sincere commitment. \nThat is essential for countries in the South to access \nfinancial resources and technology that are essential for \ncapacity building. It is vital that we also address \nstructural obstacles and political barriers that prevented \nthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals, \nsuch as unfair trade and investment rules. Creating \n\n\na supportive international economic environment, \nenhanced investment flows, including from multilateral \ndevelopment banks, and an open multilateral trading \nregime, are important.\n\nThe role of the United Nations in advancing \ninternational peace, security and prosperity is crucial \nin the contemporary world. However, in order to gain \nthe confidence and good will of the international \ncommunity as a whole, one of the essential requirements \nis consistency of standards across the board without \nany perception of selectivity or discrimination. It is in \nthis context that the current functioning of the system \nneeds examination in order to enhance its credibility. \nHuman rights are used as a tool to implement motivated \nagendas with no understanding or appreciation of \nthe complexity of issues in the countries concerned. \nHuman rights should be recognized by all as a moral \nand ethical concept rather than as a political tool. \nExternal intervention without adequate consideration \nof the structures in a society and cultural traditions \nof countries where such intervention takes place, \ninevitably results in destabilization, which is very much \nin evidence today in most parts of the world.\n\n\nPost-conflict Sri Lanka has also become an \nunfortunate victim of ill-conceived agendas of some \nin the Human Rights Council who pay scant regard \nto the substantial progress achieved by Sri Lanka in \nreconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation within \na short span of five years. There is an obvious lack \nof balance and proportion in the manner in which my \ncountry is being targeted today, disregarding these \nsignificant achievements. That is in sharp contrast to \nthe approach to deeply disturbing situations involving \nhumanitarian emergencies elsewhere.\n\nIf multilateralism is to remain relevant and \neffective, reform of the institutions concerned is \nessential. To be successful this process must involve \nde-politicization of the United Nations systems and \nmechanisms and they must stop being a hostage to \ndifferent forms of funding. United Nations bodies must \nfind ways to work with governments through dialogue, \ngreater understanding of situations, and cooperation, \nincluding assistance to strengthen national institutions. \nThis approach, instead of strong-arm tactics, must form \nthe heart of multilateral diplomacy in the search for \nsustainable solutions to global challenges.\n\nThe seventieth year of the United Nations in 2015 \nalso marks the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World \nSummit where global leaders agreed to support early \nreform of the Security Council. Concrete results in this \nregard should be achieved next year at least.\n\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of \nour times. A robust global response needs to be arrived \nat in 2015 on the basis of equity and the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities.\n\nThe increase in violence in the Middle East is \ndeeply distressing. I reiterate Sri Lanka\u2019s support for \nthe early realization of a sovereign, independent, viable \nand united State of Palestine, existing within secure \nand recognized borders, side by side and at peace \nwith Israel. We look forward to welcoming Palestine \nas a full Member of the United Nations at the earliest. \nThe international community must assist Palestine to \nrebuild the country.\n\nSri Lanka firmly believes in the need for solidarity \nbetween Asia and Africa. Admiring the efforts of the \npeople of Africa to achieve socioeconomic development, \nSri Lanka has begun a process of reaching out to \ncountries in Africa for an exchange of knowledge and \nexpertise in areas of importance. The international \ncommunity must strongly support the early eradication \nof deadly diseases in Africa.\n\nSri Lanka remains committed to supporting all \nmultilateral efforts to counter terrorism deriving from \nextreme ideologies impacting on people across national \nfrontiers. Terrorism continues to be a grave threat to the \nsecurity and stability of nations throughout the globe. \nHaving suffered at the hands of terrorism, Sri Lanka \nknows well its drastic impact on societies, communities \nand institutions founded on democratic traditions and \nideals. The international community must strengthen \nmultilateral action on terrorism, including the early \nfinalization and adoption of the United Nations \nComprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.\n\nSri Lanka is also committed to supporting all \nmultilateral efforts to counter terrorism financing, \npiracy and all forms of international organized crime. \nWe wish to recall our appeal to the international \ncommunity not to support terrorist groups in any way, \neither directly or indirectly. Sri Lanka expresses its \nconcern regarding bombings that kill innocent civilians \nand even unborn children in many situations across the \nworld.\n\n\nSri Lanka expresses deep concern regarding \nunilateral economic measures against developing \ncountries and is a consistent supporter of the call of the \nGeneral Assembly for an end to the unjust economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. \nUnilateral sanctions of this nature, which impact on a \ncountry\u2019s innocent population, are unethical.\n\nDespite being affected by terrorism, Sri Lanka has \nachieved most Millennium Development Goals. Sri \nLanka has succeeded in being ranked ahead of all South \nAsian countries in the 2013 Human Development Index. \nThrough the adoption of the National Development \nStrategy \u2014 the Mahinda Chinthana, or Vision for the \nFuture \u2014 the Government of Sri Lanka embarked on \nan inclusive and rural-centric development programme. \nThat involved bold policy decisions connected with \nmacroeconomic management, revitalization of \nagriculture, infrastructure development, including \nroads and expressways, ports and airports, irrigation and \nwater distribution, a strong telecommunication network \nand well-distributed urban and township development \nresulting in 7.8 per cent gross domestic product growth \nthis year and per capita income of $3,280 in 2013. It \nis also a matter of deep satisfaction to recognize that \nthe economic and political empowerment of the people \nof the North, supported by massive investment in \ninfrastructure and livelihoods, have also contributed to \nthis growth.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s information technology literacy grew \nsteadily from a mere 3 per cent in 2005 to almost \n50 per cent in 2014. Sri Lanka\u2019s Nenasala Programme \nwas awarded the prestigious Bill and Melinda Gates \nFoundation Award as the best rural information \ntechnologyaccess programme in the world.\n\nWith the end of terrorism in May 2009, in keeping \nwith my responsibilities to my people, large-scale post-\nconflict reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement \ninitiatives were implemented in the north in a relatively \nshort period of four years. Most importantly, democratic \nstructures in the North have been re-established. \nElections to the Northern Provincial Council were held \nin September 2013 after a lapse of 28 years, upholding \nthe democratic tradition in Sri Lanka which has been \nconsistently protected since 1931, the year we attained \nuniversal franchise.\n\nI recall in this context the visit to Sri Lanka of the \nSecretary-General just a week after the conclusion of \nthe conflict, when a new era of peace had dawned. That \nwas a manifestation of the close cooperation between \nmy country and the United Nations and our commitment \nto working together in the future.\n\nWe continue on a deeply satisfying and transformative \njourney in the interests of all the people of Sri Lanka. In \ncarrying out this task we work in accordance with our \ntraditional foreign policy of friendship towards all and \nenmity towards none. We hope that the international \ncommunity will reciprocate and assist Sri Lanka in \nits domestic process of reconciliation and economic \ndevelopment without exerting undue pressure on us.\n\nWe have gained inspiration from the words of \nGautama the Buddha who said that the purpose of all \nhuman endeavour must be to construct order out of \nchaos and harmony out of strife. True to these words \nof wisdom, the Government of Sri Lanka remains \ncommitted to its objective of pursuing the processes of \nreconciliation and nation building, undeterred by ill-\nmotivated criticism.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like \nto congratulate Mr. Kutesa on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession.\n\nIn the opening sentences of our Charter, we read \nthat the United Nations was set up to save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm \nfaith in fundamental human rights and in the equal \nrights of nations large and small. In the year marking \nthe 100th anniversary of the start of the First World \nWar and the seventy-fifth of the start of the Second \nWorld War, those words hold a particular resonance for \nus \u2014 for Poles, Europeans and every society affected \nby those tragedies. Both wars were waged partly on \nPolish territory; the second began with Nazi Germany\u2019s \naggression in collaboration with the Soviet Union. Our \npast compels us to reflect on the Charter\u2019s words and \nthose events of twentieth-century history, which form \nthe backdrop to our decision-making at the national \n\nlevel, and similarly bind together the entire international \ncommunity gathered here at the United Nations.\n\nOne result of the First World War was to foster the \ndream of a world without war. That belief and general \ndesire bore fruit in the League of Nations, the first \ncollective security system in history. It included all \nthe factors needed to make a positive mark on history \nand to maintain peace and security. It functioned on \na foundation of important rules that prohibited war \nand encouraged the peaceful settlement of disputes. It \nhad shared bodies, disarmament conferences and an \ninternational judiciary.\n\nDespite all those institutions, however, we were \nunable to make a world without wars. The League \neventually became an easy target, if not an object of \nridicule. Yet it was not the League itself that failed. It \nwas failed by its members, and chiefly by the Powers \nthat had been entrusted with special responsibility for \nimplementing its principal task. They failed their test in \nthe face of the expansion of totalitarian regimes on both \nthe left and the right. The emergence of communism, \nnational socialism and many militaristic dictatorships \nwas in part due to the First World War. Those systems \nfed on conflict, because ideological war and war against \nother peoples \u2014 against other men \u2014 were part of their \nidentity.\n\nThose threats could have been resisted in time, \nbut the democratic world failed, choosing a short-\nsighted policy of appeasement and the satisfaction of \ndictatorships\u2019 appetites at the expense of weaker States. \nThe price paid for that negligence was the Second World \nWar, and the whole of humankind had to pay a price \nthat would once have been unimaginable. It is from \nthe horrible experience of that war, of the Holocaust, \nthat the legal notion of genocide stems. Its originator \nand the author of the Convention on the Prevention \nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was a Polish \nlawyer, Raphael Lemkin, who understood the criminal \nnature of both kinds of totalitarianism even before the \nwar.\n\nAfter the hecatombs of the war, the international \ncommunity decided once again to build a system of \ncollective security. I am glad that next year we will be \ncelebrating the seventieth anniversary of the foundation \nof the United Nations. There are very few now who \nremember the world without our Organization, and \nit would be difficult to imagine the world without \nits activity. During the nearly seven decades of its \nexistence, the United Nations has had a track record of \namazing achievements, but also many failures.\n\nToday, however, the situation is especially \nworrying, as symptoms of the problems that once \nbrought down the League of Nations are reappearing. \nWe are witnessing a rebirth of the super-Power, a return \nto the thinking that divided the world into categories \nof geopolitical zones of influence and that has already \nled the international community into a morass of \nhatred, confrontation and conflict. The United Nations \nshould remain vigilant in the face of a return to such \nattitudes\u2014 it should tolerate no departure from the \nprinciples of security and international relations laid \ndown in the Charter. Tolerance of such attitudes always \nends badly and not infrequently leads to catastrophe.\n\nWe cannot overemphasize that the occupation \nof Crimea and the aggression in Ukraine violate \nthe standards of international law and trample on \nthe fundamental values of the United Nations. The \nideological background of the conflict is a return to \nthe rhetoric of the first half of the twentieth century, \na return to the logic of zones of influence, of might is \nright, and of ruthless imperial domination of weaker \nneighbours, which are apparently obliged to be obedient \nsatellites of a Power redesigning the foundations of the \ncivilized international order.\n\nThe Security Council, the organ responsible \nfor peace, proved to be ineffective when faced with \nconflicts in Ukraine and other regions of the world, \npartly due to its rules of operation. We are threatened \nby a further descent into powerlessness if such rules are \nnot amended. It is salutary that the General Assembly \nrose to the challenge when, in resolution 68/262, of \n27 March 2014, it took the side of the weaker party that \nwas being targeted in an act of imperial aggression.\n\nI feel all the more sad and concerned uttering \nthe foregoing words, since we are celebrating the \njoyful twenty-fifth anniversary of the abolishment \nof communism and the collapse of the Soviet bloc \nin Poland, which is also being celebrated in other \ncountries of the region. That \u201cspring of nations\u201d, the \nsecond in the history of Europe, brought freedom to \nthe nations of Central and Eastern Europe and respect \nfor human rights and good democratic governance. At \nthe time, changes for the better took place throughout \nEurope, and even worldwide. The Iron Curtain fell and \nso did the bipolar division of the world. The Cold War \nconfrontation and its accompanying threats of nuclear \nconflict became things of the past.\n\nThat historical change began in Poland with the \nestablishment of the 10 million-strong Solidarity \nmovement, a peaceful opposition movement against \ntotalitarian oppression and the violation of nations\u2019 \nrights. The victorious parliamentary elections of 4 June \nbrought about the formation, on 12 September 1989, \nof the first non-Communist Government in our part of \nEurope since the Second World War, the Government of \nTadeusz Mazowiecki.\n\nJust two weeks later, on 25 September, precisely \n25 years ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in that \nnew Government, Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski, \naddressed the Assembly from this very rostrum (see \nA/44/PV.4) and proclaimed that the new Poland would \nnot respect the logic of zones of influence. He further \nrevealed that we would respect existing treaties and \nobligations, as well as the security interests of other \nStates, and none of that would result in any limitations \nwith respect to choosing or changing the system of \npolity.\n\nThat new logic of international relations has \nbeen most beneficial for Europe, where a great wave \nof unification has been set in motion thanks to the \nstrengthening of the mechanisms of integration of the \nEuropean Community and its expansion to include \nmany new States. In our region, the European Union \nis a synonym for peace. It was established so that \nthere would be no more wars on a continent that had \npreviously been notorious for them. And indeed, the \nEuropean Union has become a significant force for \npeace in Europe and far beyond its borders, to which \nPoland has contributed in a highly active way.\n\nWe had the right to hope that the benefits of the end \nof divisions in Europe and of the logic of imperial zones \nof influence would be shared by a growing number of \nStates and nations \u2014 and not only in Europe \u2014 and that \nthey would be able to decide their fate democratically \nand build their lives in peace and prosperity, free from \nexternal domination. We have hoped and continue to \nhope for a democratic modernization of Russia. But \nwhat happened six months ago in Eastern Europe \ndealt a blow to that hope and threatened security \non our European continent. In our part of Europe, \npeople are again asking themselves whether war as a \nmethod of obtaining a political goal will also be the \nlong-term European reality. We cannot acquiesce to \nthe brutalization of international life anywhere in the \nworld \u2014 far less so in Europe, where the wounds of two \nWorld Wars are still healing.\n\nYet wars and conflicts are also continuing in other \nparts of our globe and are creating countless victims, \nsuffering and destruction. We have all been surprised \nby the rapid development of the so-called Islamic \nState of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The brutality of \nthe actions of its fighters, who are murdering and \npersecuting people of every faith, including those who \nprofess Islam, must inspire terror and trigger a response \nfrom the international community. ISIL\u2019s barbarism is a \nchallenge for all of humankind, irrespective of religion, \nethnic origin or political viewpoint. We, the States \nfaithful to the United Nations Charter, cannot shirk our \nresponsibility for providing security. We are responsible \nfor protecting those threatened by cruel violence. Yet \neverything must be done to ensure that the actions we \ntake do not contravene the United Nations Charter.\n\nWe express our concern and sympathy for the \ncivilian victims of the conflicts and tragedies in Syria, \nLibya, Israel, the Gaza Strip and many African States. \nAll those conflicts, and to an even greater degree the \ncivil wars in some African countries, are accompanied \nby humanitarian catastrophes. The United Nations, \nand especially the super-Powers that can influence \nthe participating parties, should do everything to stop \nthem.\n\nNobody could ever take the place of the United \nNations and its agencies in providing aid to refugees \nand other victims of humanitarian tragedies. On \nbehalf of Poland, I hereby express appreciation for \nthem. and recognition for the thousands of courageous \nmembers of humanitarian organizations, United \nNations agencies and non-governmental organizations \nwho, amid all the dangers and frequently at the cost of \ntheir own lives, hurry to the aid of those who suffer \npersecution. They help those whose security and health \nis threatened \u2014 those left alone, without a roof over \ntheir heads, who are far away from homes to which, \ndue to destruction, many will never be able to return. \nAn ever-increasing number of people are experiencing \nsuffering and cruelty linked to military conflicts. \nThat horrifying trend must be stopped by our common \nefforts.\n\nThe fact that, in so many places, we are witnessing \nconflicts that entail human tragedy and the deaths \nof thousands of people is due, as a general rule, to a \nfailure to observe fundamental human rights. Entire \ncommunities and nations are denied influence over \npolitical decisions. Power without control is, in most \ncases, corrupt and self-loving, incapable of lifting \n\ncountries out of underdevelopment and poverty. That \nis the background to the conflicts and rebellions in \nUkraine, Iraq, Libya and many other places in the world. \nThat is why we must increase our efforts to help by \noffering development assistance to bring about social, \neconomic and political transformation. Otherwise, the \nonly alternative to dictatorship will be chaos.\n\nPoland is especially attached to the role of \ndemocracy in the life of nations, their development \nand international activity. We know how much we lost \nbecause of the absence of democracy under communism, \nand we know how much we gained when we returned to \ndemocracy as a means of achieving our civic aspirations \nand an expression of our national sovereignty. It was \nfor that purpose that a broad international initiative by \nthe Community of Democracies was born in Warsaw in \n2000. That is precisely why my country established the \ninternational Lech Wa..sa Solidarity Award for activity \nin support of democracy and fundamental freedoms.\n\nPoland steadfastly believes that sustainable \ndevelopment cannot be achieved without the rule of law \nand respect for fundamental rights and freedoms for \nall. We will strive to attain the appropriate inclusion of \nthose questions in the new United Nations development \nagenda. Through our experiences over the past few \ndecades in our history, we have learned the importance \nof solidarity, responsibility and involvement \u2014 the \ntriad of principles in the United Nations system we are \nfaithful to.\n\nWe fully acknowledge the involvement of the \nUnited Nations in the improvement of the social and \neconomic situation in those regions of the world where \nconditions are the most difficult. Poland actively \nparticipates in the definition of the priorities and means \nof implementation of the new development agenda that \nwill replace the Millennium Development Goals of \n2000, and we will purposefully participate in making \nit a reality. The new development agenda should fully \nand coherently integrate the economic, social and \nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development, \nwhile at the same time focusing on the reduction of \npoverty and protection of the natural environment.\n\nReaching an international understanding on that \nmatter is a task that is as ambitious as it is difficult \u2014 yet \nit is necessary and feasible. The output of the previous \nAssembly session, worked on by the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals under \nthe highly efficient co-chairmanship of Kenya and \nHungary, defines the course of further discussion on \nthe matter. Poland will continue its active involvement \nin a dialogue that should bring about the development of \na new, ambitious and universal post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nIt is vitally important to halt any further global \nclimate change caused by the development of human \ncivilization and to adjust to the changes that are already \nirreversible. Here lurk existential issues pertaining \nto security, the problems of economic development, \nthe maintenance of biological diversity in the Earth\u2019s \necosystem and quality of life. In its capacity as host \nof the United Nations Climate Change Conference held \nin Warsaw in November 2013, and as we still hold the \npresidency of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nPoland remains committed to achieving a successful \nconclusion to the negotiations. We believe that it is \npossible to achieve an understanding in a manner \nthat is fair to countries at various levels of economic \ndevelopment. Agreement is possible, and I hope such \nan understanding will be arrived at in the near future. \nI would like to reiterate that, despite the hardships and \ncosts of economic transformation, Poland has decreased \nits greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 per \ncent since 1988 \u2014 that is, it has greatly exceeded the \nreduction obligations stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nPoland is deeply involved in various fields of \nactivity covered by this Organization, ranging from \nhuman rights to disarmament. That is why we know \nperfectly well that nothing can replace the United \nNations system, which is continuously improvable. \nPoland is currently assuming an increasing measure \nof responsibility for cooperation in development, \nhumanitarian aid and climate protection. We are \nready to share our experience and our ideas as a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \nperiod 2018-2019. We intend to support a reform of that \nbody that will increase its representative character and, \nin parallel, reinforce its efficiency. The reform should \nprimarily concern the Council\u2019s mandate in situations \ninvolving the principle of the responsibility to protect, \nwhich was approved by our community in 2005. The \nidea must be to develop a mechanism that will provide \nthe Council with the capacity to act in such situations, \nwhile at the same time making it impossible to use the \nmandate of the Council for purposes other than the \ndischarge of that responsibility.\n\n\nI have raised that idea from this rostrum twice \nalready. It should perhaps be combined with a broader \nreform of the Council, the outlines of which were given \nshape before the historic summit held in 2005. The \nsituation is unchanged from nearly 70 years ago \u2014 we \nwant to save succeeding generations from the scourge \nof war and reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights \nand the rights of nations, large and small.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, I should first \nlike to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \nKutesa on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session.\n\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea fully \nendorses the main theme of this session, \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d. Development is one of the \ncore missions of the United Nations. With peace, it \nconstitutes one of the two pillars for the sustainable \ndevelopment of humankind. During the first 15 years \nof the new millennium, the world has seen the poverty \nrate reduced by half. It is proof of success, illustrating \nthe correctness of the Millennium Development Goals, \nadopted at the Millennium Summit, with the elimination \nof poverty as the main target.\n\nIt has been a particularly difficult time for the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. However, \nwe too have overcome severe hardships. Despite \nan unprecedentedly persistent economic blockade, \nmilitary threat and political obstruction, we have firmly \nsafeguarded national dignity, effectively deterred war \nand put the stagnant economy on an upward track \nunder the leadership of the great General Kim Jong Il. \nToday we have at last secured a reliable springboard to \nleap into a powerful nation, following the guidance of \nrespected Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\nIn the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \ntoday, a grand construction boom is in full swing, and \nmodern factories and enterprises befitting the era of \nthe knowledge economy are being built and founded at \nrecord-breaking speed in many parts of the country. We \nhave observed a great leap in our fishing industry and \nlivestock farming, as well as a blooming new twenty-\nfirst century civilization in the living environment and \ncultural and welfare spheres for future generations and \nthe working masses.\n\nThe climate change Summit held just a few days \nago was a successful gathering that constituted part \nof the active measures being taken across the United \nNations system to ensure the survival of humankind \nand sustainable development by protecting the global \necosystem and addressing climate change.\n\nThe United Nations and international relations \nshould be democratized further. The principle of \nsovereign equality enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations is exactly same as the principle of respect for \nsovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs \nof other nations. However, acts of high-handedness and \narbitrariness \u2014 veiled under various disguises such \nas democracy, humanitarian crises, counter-terrorism, \nhuman rights protection and non-proliferation \u2014 are \ncommitted brazenly in the form of sanctions, blockade, \nmilitary threat and armed intervention. That is the stern \nreality we witness today.\n\nProceeding from its consistent position of opposing \ninterference and sanctions in all their manifestations \nagainst sovereign States, our delegation holds that \nthe unilateral economic, trade and financial blockade \nimposed by the United States against Cuba should be \nimmediately dismantled.\n\nWith respect to the issue of enhancing the central \nrole of the United Nations, we see its functions and \nrole regarding peace and security lagging far behind \nothers. As stipulated in the Charter, Member States \nentrusted the Security Council with the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security as its first and foremost \nresponsibility. Present reality shows that in lieu of the \nSecurity Council \u2014 which is still mired in the paralysis \nof the Cold War \u2014 a permanent member seeks to act as \nthe military police of the world through military blocs \nor bilateral military alliances that have nothing to do \nwith the United Nations.\n\nThe anachronistic stereotypes and prejudices of the \nSecurity Council find their most extreme expression \nin the prevailing situation on the Korean peninsula. \nThe world remembers that the situation on the Korean \npeninsula reached the touch-and-go brink of war last \nyear. It started with the United States-South Korea joint \nmilitary exercises aimed at occupying the capital city \nof Pyongyang of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea.\n\nIn January, the Government of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea made a proposal to \nstop hostile military acts on the Korean peninsula, \nbut provocative joint military exercises against the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea were forcibly \nconducted in March, April and August. The Government \nof the Democratic People\u2019s Republic officially referred \nto the Security Council the issue of suspending such \nwar exercises, which seriously endanger the peace and \nsecurity of the Korean peninsula and the region as a \nwhole. However, the Council turned its back. As the \njoint military exercises were led by one of its permanent \nmembers, the Council was bound to close its eyes, block \nits ears and shut its mouth, no matter how enormous in \nscale, aggressive in purpose and dangerous in nature \nthey were.\n\nEven in the Cold War period, measures were in \nplace between the East and the West to restrict the \nnumber of military exercises in which more than 40,000 \ntroops took part. We are obliged to ask why such war \nexercises, with the participation of more than 500,000 \ntroops at a time, are needed annually only on the Korean \npeninsula, nearly a quarter of a century after the Cold \nWar ended.\n\nAt present, the Government of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea has set economic \nconstruction and improvement of the people\u2019s living \nstandards as its major task. Accordingly, a peaceful \nenvironment is vital in allowing us to lead the recently \nimproving trend of the national economy to sustainable \ndevelopment. A peaceful environment and the reduction \nof tensions are more precious to us now than at any time. \nThe tense situation on the Korean peninsula does not \nhelp us. On the contrary, it presents a serious obstacle \nto our efforts to achieve economic development and an \nimproved living standard.\n\nWar exercises focused on landing, long-range \nnuclear bombing and commando operations aimed at \noccupying the capital city of another country can never \nbe viewed as defensive. The claim that they are annual \nin nature is just a veiled attempt to succeed in a surprise \nattack after creating chronic immunity to them.\n\nThe reform of the Security Council should no \nlonger be delayed. The Council\u2019s current structure \nand method of work have long been out of date, as \nconfirmed by the expressed general will of Member \nStates reflected in resolution 47/62, adopted in 1992. \nThe Security Council should no longer be an exhibition \nshowcase for the extreme manifestation of the double \nstandard. We must put an end to the unjust practice \nwhereby the military exercises waged by a permanent \nmember of the Council are covered up with no regard \nto their serious threat to peace and security, whereas \nthose conducted by a Member State in response are \ncalled into question, although they are inevitable and \nself-defensive in nature.\n\nLikewise, the Security Council simply ignores \nthe killing of Palestinian civilians by Israel under the \npatronage of a permanent member, yet selectively takes \nissue with the actions of the Syrian Government in \ndefence of the sovereignty and stability of its country. \nThis unjust practice cannot be tolerated. In particular, \nno act should be allowed to encroach on the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Syria under the guise of \ncounter-terrorism.\n\nThe Security Council should no longer serve as \na forum for the spreading of lies. Eleven years ago, \nwe heard with our own ears the accusation made at a \nSecurity Council meeting by a permanent member \nthat there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq \n(see S/PV.4701). A military invasion followed, and \ntragic bloodshed resulted. Only then did the world \ncome to realize that it had heard the big lie of the \ncentury. However, because the big lie had come from \na permanent member, the Security Council kept silent \nagain. As a result, the bloodshed continues even today, \nafter 11 years.\n\nThe Security Council should not be abused as a \ntool to justify high-handedness and arbitrariness. The \nUnited Nations Charter stipulates that the Security \nCouncil should act in conformity with the principles \nof justice and international law. The Security Council \nhas no authority to adopt a resolution that prohibits the \npeaceful launch of a satellite by a Member State, as that \nis in contravention of international law, in particular the \nTreaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States \nin the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including \nthe Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.\n\n\nThe reform of the Security Council would, \nin essence, democratize the United Nations and \ninternational relations. The United Nations is not a \nmonarchy and the Security Council is not a senate. \nThe reform of the Security Council will not be possible \nunless its members decide in good faith to give up their \nprerogatives in the interests of democracy. Given the \nchanging times and the demands of the majority of \nMember States, the permanent member that is most \nvociferous about the export of democracy should reflect \non whether or not its preaching is just hypocrisy. Should \nthe Security Council fail to reform itself and remain \nout of step with the times, Member States may well opt \nfor a United Nations without such an anachronistic and \nundemocratic Council.\n\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nmaintains that all problems pertaining to international \nrelations should be resolved not by high-handedness and \narbitrariness, but in strict accordance with the principles \nof sovereign equality enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter. The nuclear issue is a matter of the sovereignty \nand the right to exist of a Member State and must take \nprecedence over peace and security. The hostile policy, \nnuclear threat and stifling strategy pursued by the \nUnited States for more than half a century inevitably \nprompted the decision of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea to become a nuclear-weapon State.\n\nThe nuclear deterrent of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea is neither intended to threaten or \nattack others, nor a bargaining chip to be exchanged \nfor something else. The nuclear issue will be resolved if \nand when the substance of the threat to our sovereignty \nand right to life is removed through the termination \nof the hostile policy of the United States towards the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nPoliticization, selectivity and double standards are \nout of place when dealing with human rights issues. The \nabuse of human rights for political purposes is in itself \nthe biggest human rights violation. The Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea is firmly opposed to all \nattempts and actions to force regime change on specific \ncountries by alleging abuse of human rights. The United \nStates does not recognize the national sovereignty that \nsafeguards the human rights of our people. That being \nthe case, it is hypocritical of it to find fault with our \nhuman rights issues. It is all the more preposterous \nthat the United States should talk about a human rights \ndialogue when it adamantly prevents the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea \u2014 the party directly \ninvolved \u2014 from participating in the meeting on the \nlatter\u2019s own human rights situation.\n\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is \nalways open to dialogue and cooperation in the case of \ngenuine human rights issues that are devoid of any form \nof political motivation or hypocrisy. The Government of \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is willing to \npromote human rights dialogue and cooperation on an \nequal footing with other countries that are not hostile to \nit. It is also willing to facilitate technical cooperation, \ncontact and communication with the United Nations \nand other international organizations in the human \nrights field.\n\nThe reunification of the fatherland is the supreme \ndesire of the entire Korean nation. The Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea maintains that national \nreunification should be achieved not through a \nconfrontation of systems but by a confederation formula \nwhereby two systems coexist in a single country. It \nis the only way to prevent war and safeguard peace. \nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea is sincerely striving by both word and deed \nto develop inter-Korean relations and to orient them \ntowards reunification through confederation.\n\nAs South Korea has relinquished its military \nprerogatives to the United States in their entirety, it \nhas no idea how many weapons of mass destruction of \nvarious kinds \u2014 capable of destroying the Korean nation \nmore than hundreds of times over \u2014 are now deployed \nand hidden on its own soil. It should therefore refrain \nfrom prattling and dreaming about the unrealistic and \nfictitious proposal for reunification copied from the \nformula of other countries.\n\nI should like to assure members that the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea will constructively \n\n\nparticipate in delivering on the post-2015 development \nagenda at the current session and thus make an active \ncontribution to the work for the successful adoption \nof the development agenda next year on the occasion \nof the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the \nUnited Nations. Independence, peace and friendship \nare the foreign policy ideals of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea. As in the past, the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea will fulfil its responsibilities \nand discharge its role as an independent Member \nState by steadfastly adhering to these ideals in United \nNations activities.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Philippine Government, we offer our warmest \ncongratulations to Mr. Kutesa on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. I assure him of the Philippines\u2019 steadfast \nsupport as he provides the leadership and inspiration \nin the daunting task of continuing the pursuit of a \ntransformative and inclusive post-2015 development \nagenda. In choosing the theme for his presidency, he \nhas positioned people at the centre of this development \nagenda. This people-centred agenda is also at the core \nof President Benigno S. Aquino III\u2019s Social Contract \nwith the Filipino People, which is underpinned by a \nregime of good governance.\n\nI would like to address the following issues, which \nare consistent with both the President\u2019s Social Contract \nand the United Nations post-2015 development agenda: \nprogress on the Millennium Development Goals; climate \nchange and disaster-risk reduction and management; \nthe so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham; the \nEbola virus disease outbreak; peace, security and the \nrule of law; disarmament, peacekeeping, migration, \nthe protection of women and children; and the call for \nUnited Nations reforms.\n\nFourteen years ago, a shared vision of a decent and \nsecure life for all our peoples motivated us to adopt \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We all vowed to \nundertake a mission to fight poverty and disease; grant \nchildren of school age access to primary education; \nimprove gender equality, care for mothers and children; \nprovide our communities with safe drinking water; \nprotect our environment from further degradation; \nand mobilize international partnerships and resources \nto help those in great need. Today, based on the latest \nreport on the Millennium Development Goals, our \ncollective efforts have reduced by half the number of \npeople living in extreme poverty, provided over 2 billion \npeople with access to safe drinking water, and achieved \nsuccess in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. \nBut, with one year to go, much remains to be done.\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 scorecard shows that we have made \nconsiderable progress in the areas of extreme poverty \neradication, under age 5 mortality, the fight against \nboth malaria and tuberculosis, access to safe drinking \nwater, and gender equality. Like many other developing \nnations, however, we continue to face challenges in \nother areas. We have recently taken pause to consider \nnew strategies. We have also realized the importance of \nstrengthening good-quality data collection and analysis \nas a tool for measuring our Millennium Development \nGoals and to aid our decision-making.\n\nA year ago, before this very same Assembly, the \nPhilippines called for a post-2015 development agenda \nanchored in respect and promotion of human rights, \naccountable governance and inclusive development \n(see A/68/PV.22). All our current national efforts are \nfounded on these pillars.\n\nThe greatest challenge to the Philippines in \nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals has been \nthe series of disasters that have visited our country. \nSuper-typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon to have \nhit landfall in recorded history, had a significant impact \non the modest progress we had achieved towards the \nMillennium Development Goals. This and the disasters \nin other parts of the world remind us of the urgent need \nto address climate change.\n\nTwo months ago, we completed a comprehensive \nrehabilitation and recovery plan for the Haiyan-affected \nareas. The comprehensive plan requires a considerable \namount of resources and effort, but the Philippines \nand its international partners are determined to see \nthis massive rebuilding and rehabilitation plan to full \ncompletion. We are resolute in not only building back, \nbut building back better. Once again, let me reiterate \nthe Filipino people\u2019s gratitude for the outpouring \nof assistance from the international community for \nthe victims and survivors of Haiyan. Its response \nand solidarity were indeed timely, overwhelming \nand inspiring. At this time, we look forward to the \nforthcoming Third World Conference on Disaster Risk \nReduction in Sendai, Japan, and to the first-ever World \nHumanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, during \nwhich we hope to share the lessons we have learned \nfrom Haiyan.\n\nJust as the international community mobilized \nas one in extending help to the Philippines in the \naftermath of Haiyan, it should also do so in the case of \ntwo present-day scourges: the so-called Islamic State \nin Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and the Ebola virus disease \noutbreak. The Philippines condemns the war crimes \nand crimes against humanity being perpetrated by ISIS. \nWe support Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on \nforeign terrorist fighters, adopted on 24 September, \n\nbecause we believe that resolute and immediate action \nis necessary to suppress that group. As a responsible \nmember of the international community, the Philippines \nwill do its part in the global efforts to thwart ISIS and \nits false ideologies.\n\nOn the Ebola virus disease outbreak, the Philippines \nrecognizes its threat to global health and its impact on \ndevelopment. Based on our capacity, we will support \nthe international community\u2019s efforts in arresting the \nspread of this scourge through the auspices of the World \nHealth Organization.\n\nDevelopment efforts are jeopardized by setbacks \nbrought about by threats to peace, security and the rule \nof law. We must ensure that conflicts do not undermine \nany development agenda that we pursue. We must \nrededicate ourselves to the principles enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations and relevant international \nconventions and agreements to resolve all conflicts \npeacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\n\nIn this spirit, I am pleased to share the Philippine \nexperience in building peace in the southern \nPhilippines. With the signing of the Comprehensive \nAgreement on the Bangsamoro, we are optimistic \nthat peace dividends in the form of investments, jobs, \neconomic opportunities, access to basic services and \ninfrastructure will finally redound to the benefit of \nour Muslim brothers and sisters. We are grateful to \nthe United Nations and the international community \nfor their role in supporting us through the long and \nchallenging journey of this peace process.\n\nAs we herald these achievements of peace at home, \nhowever, we face the reality of exacerbating tensions in \nour regional seas. Again, the Philippines has resorted \nto the rule of law in trying to resolve these tensions. \nThe Philippines believes that the core instrument for \nresolving maritime disputes is the 1982 United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We have \ninvited a State party to settle our maritime disputes \npeacefully through UNCLOS, including its provisions \non dispute settlement, specifically arbitration under \nannex VII to the Convention.\n\nHowever, it has refused to join us and has continued \nto unilaterally embark on an expansionist claim that \nviolates the legitimate rights of the Philippines and \nother littoral neighbours under UNCLOS, such as their \nexclusive economic zones and continental shelves. \nInstead of peacefully resolving the maritime disputes \nwithin the framework of UNCLOS, the said State \nhas embarked on a series of dangerous, reckless and \nforceful activities in an attempt to impose unilateral \nchange in the maritime status quo of the South China \nSea. Those unilateral activities escalated the tensions \nand threatened peace and stability in the South China \nSea.\n\nIn 2012, after forcibly occupying the tiny rocks of \nScarborough Shoal, within 126 nautical miles of the \nPhilippine island of Luzon, the aforementioned State \nrefused to abide by a mutual agreement to de-escalate \ntensions by not withdrawing its vessels from the said \nrocks. Earlier this year, said State imposed a unilateral \nmoratorium on fishing in some areas of the South \nChina Sea that infringes on the legitimate sovereign \nrights of the Philippines and other coastal States to \ntheir exclusive economic zones. In the past two years, \nit has undertaken massive land reclamation activities in \nJohnson Reef, Mckennan Reef, Hughes Reef, Cuarteron \nReef and Gaven Reef in the Spratly Islands.\n\nThose unilateral activities, among others, form part \nof a pattern of forcing a change in the maritime status \nquo in order to advance a so-called nine-dash line \nposition, an expansive claim of indisputable sovereignty \nover nearly the entire South China Sea, which is in \ncontravention of both the 2002 China and Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Declaration on \nthe Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the \nUNCLOS. The Philippines supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s call for States parties to clearly define and \npublicize the limits of their respective maritime zones \nso that parties will have greater certainty concerning \ntheir maritime spaces.\n\nUNCLOS provides a viable mechanism for \nresolving conflicts, inter alia through arbitration. \nArbitration is an open, friendly and durable mechanism \nfor the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. \nArbitration, in defining maritime entitlements, is \nintended to benefit all. Therefore, the Philippines is \nmore determined than ever in its pursuit of all possible \nmeans under international law to keep the conflict from \nescalating and undermining regional peace, security, \nand stability.\n\nAt the 47th meeting of the Ministers for Foreign \nAffairs of ASEAN, in Nay Pyi Taw, the Philippines \nproposed the triple action plan to reduce tensions. \nOur triple action plan proposal contains immediate, \nintermediate and final approaches to address the \nprovocative and destabilizing activities in the South \nChina Sea. It is a positive, comprehensive and \n\nconstructive framework that brings together various \ninitiatives that the Philippines and other countries have \nbeen advocating on the issue of the South China Sea for \nseveral years.\n\nAs an immediate approach, the triple action plan \ncalls for the cessation of specific activities that escalate \ntensions in the region, pursuant to paragraph 5 of \nthe 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct \nof Parties in the South China Sea. Paragraph 5 calls \nfor, first, self-restraint; secondly, no inhabitation of \nuninhabited features, including massive reclamation; \nand thirdly, the handling of differences in a constructive \nmanner. For the intermediate approach to managing \ntensions until a final resolution is achieved, the triple \naction plan highlights the need for the full and effective \nimplementation of the Declaration and the expeditious \nconclusion of a code of conduct. As a final approach, the \ntriple action plan underscores the need for a settlement \nmechanism to bring the disputes to a final and enduring \nresolution anchored in international law.\n\nThe Philippines is pursuing such a resolution \nthrough arbitration and believes that the arbitration \ndecision will clarify maritime entitlements and will pave \nthe way for the full resolution of the maritime disputes \nin the South China Sea. Those approaches under the \ntriple action plan can be pursued simultaneously, and \nthey do not prejudice territorial claims. We enjoin all to \nbe united in addressing the challenge of resolving this \nissue in accordance with the rule of law.\n\nOn disarmament, the Philippines is deeply \nconcerned about the threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction, from the Middle East to the Korean \npeninsula. The Philippines has remained firm in \nits position on the total and complete elimination \nof nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The \nPhilippines strongly believes that the conference on \nthe establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction \nshould be convened as soon as possible. The Six-Party \nTalks on the Korean peninsula should restart. We need \na successful outcome to the 2015 Review Conference \nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons to ensure the credibility of the Treaty.\n\nThe Philippines strongly supports the ongoing \ndiscourse on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear \nweapons that has been gaining ground within and \noutside the United Nations. We will continue to lend \nour voice to calls for nuclear disarmament until we have \nreached the goal of global zero. The Philippines also \ndeplores the use of landmines and improvised explosive \ndevices and the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons, which, unfortunately, still continue around \nthe world.\n\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions are crucial \nto international peace and security. The Philippines, \nthrough its continuous participation in peacekeeping \nmissions, has shown its steadfast commitment to \ncontributing to that worthy cause. Let me take this \nopportunity to thank our partners in the international \ncommunity for their invaluable assistance in recent \nincidents involving our Philippine peacekeepers, \nspecifically in the United Nations Disengagement \nObserver Force in the Golan Heights. Our collective \naction has highlighted the importance that the \ninternational community continues to accord to United \nNations peacekeeping.\n\nIn the face of grave danger, Filipino peacekeepers \nhave bravely helped to safeguard world peace. They have \nserved with honour, distinction and professionalism in \nimplementing peacekeeping mandates. We are deeply \nconcerned about the continuing and emerging dangers \nfaced by all United Nations peacekeepers, and urge the \nUnited Nations and all fellow Member States to ensure \nthat those dangers are addressed comprehensively. \nWe believe that outstanding operational and tactical \nissues relating to United Nations peacekeeping must be \nresolved at the highest levels as soon as possible. The \nPhilippines reiterates its solid commitment to upholding \nmultilateral peacekeeping, collective security and the \nrule of law.\n\nWhen we speak of inclusive development, we must \ntake into full account the invaluable contributions \nthat migrant workers make to global development and \nprogress. Their well-being is a shared responsibility \nand part of the international community\u2019s commitment \nto promoting inclusive societies. Those migrants are \nespecially vulnerable in times of conflict and should \nnot be forgotten. They deserve the complete support \nand cooperation of the international community in \nensuring their safety, security and well-being. For such \nan important task, all countries \u2014 whether receiving, \ntransit or sending \u2014 must be fully involved.\n\nWe are also alarmed that migrants, particularly \nwomen and children, continue to be victims of \ntrafficking. National and international efforts to \nprevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers and assist \nin the recovery and rehabilitation of victims must be \nstrengthened. From a broader perspective, we should \n\nfully respect the rights of migrants by according them \nequal treatment in all countries. The Philippines will \ncontinue to support efforts to protect the basic rights of \nmigrants, recognize their contributions to development \nand secure for them a place in the inclusive societies \nthat we envision in the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nAs we discuss and negotiate the best ways to deliver \nand implement the post-2015 development agenda, we \nshould take concrete action on the proposed United \nNations reforms that have been the subject of years of \ndiscussions and dialogues. The Philippines supports \nchange and reform in the United Nations to strengthen \nits ability to meet new demands and deliver its mandate \nin the most effective, transparent, accountable and \nefficient manner. Reforms should include a better \nselection process for the Secretary-General, the \nPresident of the General Assembly and executive heads \nof the United Nations; an increase in the membership \nof the Security Council; a review of the use of the veto \npower in the Security Council; an increased budget \nfor peacekeeping missions; and ways to make full and \neffective use of partnerships across the range of United \nNations activities. For example, if we were to elect a \nwoman to be the next Secretary-General of the United \nNations, that would be a powerful signal on gender \nequality and empowerment.\n\nAs we set the stage to roll out a new set of goals \nfor the post-2015 development agenda, let us not lose \ntrack of the equal importance of an enabling political \nand social environment to support the goals. When \nconflicts and insecurity endure, when disasters strike, \nwhen pandemics break out, when terrorism spreads \nand when the Earth\u2019s bounties are confronted with \ndepletion, we face the real danger that our development \nagenda will fail. It is our responsibility, therefore, as \nStates Members of the United Nations, to exert every \neffort and expend every resource at our command to \nmake the United Nations the instrument for promoting \npeace, progress and development."

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset to express my satisfaction at \nseeing Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign Affairs \nof Uganda, an African neighbour, brother and friend, \npresiding over this important session of the General \nAssembly and to assure him of our full cooperation. \nI should also like to hail his predecessor the outgoing \nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. John Ashe, and \nto pay homage to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nhis work in driving forward the role and missions of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nThe theme of the general debate focuses on the \nfuture and the prospects for future generations. This \nreminds us, on the eve of the global summit on the \npost-2015 development agenda and of the seventieth \nanniversary of the United Nations, of the urgency of \nmaking a renewed commitment to multilateralism \nfounded on international law.\n\nGiven the persistence and varied manifestations of \nthe current crisis, we must have a comprehensive vision \nin order to make the United Nations a builder of lasting \nsolutions to modern global problems. We are banking \non the hope that the new sustainable development goals \n(SDGs) will contribute to bringing about a world that \nmakes it possible for us effectively to protect human \nrights, guarantee the inclusive participation of all, and \nensure that everyone \u2014 particularly those living in \nthe forlorn regions in which 40 per cent of the poorest \npeople live \u2014 shares in prosperity.\n\nThat was the formulation expressed by the \nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the seventeenth \nMinisterial Conference hosted by Algeria in May, in \nreaffirming the relevance and importance of the right to \ndevelopment and the pressing need to eradicate poverty, \nwhich has been identified as a global challenge and a \ncentral objective of the post-2015 development agenda. \nAlgeria is pursuing its efforts to reach a comprehensive \nand ambitious agreement on the SDGs and on climate, \nto include, in the case of the latter, desertification and \naccess to genetic resources. Furthermore, we must see \nthe implementation of commitments, whether they are \ncommitments made as official development assistance \nor within the Monterrey Consensus, in the Doha \nDeclaration or at the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development.\n\nAt the United Nations, Algeria coordinates the \nNAM working group on the revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly. In that role, Algeria will continue its \nefforts to ensure that the NAM working group, which \nis the most representative in the international system, \nassumes its full role. At the same time, Algeria will \ncontinue to work with its partners in the African Union \nCommittee of Ten towards Security Council reform, \naimed at putting an end to the historical injustices \nvis-\u00e0-vis the African continent, which wants, more \nthan anything, representation and legitimacy in the \nSecurity Council. In that context, the strengthening of \ncooperation and the multiform partnerships between \nthe African Union and the United Nations should be \nencouraged, in particular in the context of the many \nconflicts and crises that continue to afflict Africa and to \nslow down the conclusion of its decolonization process.\n\nFrom that perspective, the global review that \nMr. Ban Ki-moon is called upon to present in April \n2015 on the question of Western Sahara, which pits the \nKingdom of Morocco against the Frente Popular para \nla Liberaci\u00f3n de Sagu\u00eda el-Hamra y de R\u00edo de Oro, \nmust honour the United Nations doctrine in the matter \nof decolonization, as well as stress the importance of \nthe relevant Security Council and General Assembly \nresolutions. Algeria supports the inalienable right of \nthe people of Western Sahara to self-determination, as \nhas been well established, and in that regard Algeria \nencourages the Secretary-General and his Personal \nEnvoy, Ambassador Christopher Ross, to intensify \ntheir efforts to ensure the success of that effort to move \ntowards peace.\n\nAlgeria is a stakeholder in the common destiny of \nthe peoples of the Maghreb. Algeria\u2019s own development \nhas been conceived and guided by the desire to \nachieve the integration of the vast geopolitical space \n\n\nof which it is at the very centre. The policy platform \non which President Bouteflika was re-elected and \nthe five-year plan of action of his Administration \nhinge on a deepening of participative democracy, the \nmodernization of the judiciary, equal opportunities for \nmen and women, and good governance. The economic \neffort has allocated significant public investment \nin the sectors of agriculture, industry, energy, the \nenvironment and tourism, and into the diversification \nand modernization of the economy, all based on \nobjectives tied to competitiveness and a substantial \nrelaunching of growth. At the same time, Algeria \nis working to promote development with mutually \nbeneficial strategic partners, based on respect for \nsovereignty and a balance of interests, in order to bring \nabout opportunities for cooperation and the means of \ntackling the challenges and threats of a transnational \nnature. That cooperation excludes unilateral measures \nsuch as the embargo imposed on Cuba.\n\nThe worrisome spread of the Ebola virus has been \ndeclared by the World Health Organization (WHO) \nto be a global health emergency, and that reminds us \ntragically of the structural precariousness of human \nsecurity systems, as well as of the responsibility of \nthe international community in the treatment of health \nproblems that affect the poor, who have no means or \nrole in decision-making. Algeria adds its voice to that \nof the Secretary-General in urging the United Nations \nagencies and other donors, as well as non-governmental \norganizations, quickly to provide the international \nassistance needed by the African countries that have \nbeen hit by that scourge.\n\nThat existential threat is yet another that Africa \nmust collectively take on in order to ensure its rebirth, \nand brings with it challenges in the area of peace and \nsecurity. At the behest of the stakeholders in Mali, \nAlgeria is undertaking large-scale mediation between \nthe Malian Government and the movements in the north \nof that country, working with a team that is representative \nof Africa and the international community as a whole. \nThe adoption of a road map for negotiations in the \nAlgiers process and the declaration of a cessation of \nhostilities have marked the effort towards the launching \nof substantial negotiations since 1 September, with the \naim of achieving a comprehensive and definitive peace \naccord. The launching of those negotiations has been a \nsource of satisfaction and coincides with the freeing of \ntwo Algerian diplomats who had been held hostage for \nnearly three years by a terrorist organization. I should \nlike to avail myself of this opportunity to pay homage \nto the memory of our Consul in Gao and his assistant, \nTahar Touati, who lost their lives during their period of \ncaptivity.\n\nThe situation in Libya, a sister nation, has continued \nto deteriorate over the past three years. The twofold \nAlgerian initiative to implement a common plan of \naction for all of the countries neighbouring Libya and \nfor launching an inclusive dialogue towards national \nreconciliation, which would also seek to strengthen \nState institutions, has made a valuable contribution \ntowards a collective, healthy step towards peace for the \nLibyan people, which we very much wish for them.\n\nThe difficult state of affairs in our region requires \na stepping up of efforts in the fight against terrorist \ngroups in the Sahel and their established links to drug \ntrafficking networks and transnational organized \ncrime. In the global forum of the fight against terrorism, \nAlgeria will continue to cooperate, including in its \nwork as co-Chair of the Working Group on the Sahel, \nand will focus on securing borders and on preventing \nransom-seeking abductions by terrorist organizations, \nbearing in mind the recommendations from the Algiers \nworkshop in September 2013 and the relevant resolutions \nof the General Assembly and Security Council.\n\nIn that spirit, Algeria notes with interest the results \nof the high-level Security Council meeting on terrorism \nand foreign combatants, convened on the initiative of \nPresident Obama (S/PV.7272). We also take note of \nthe international mobilization against transborder \nterrorism on a large scale, which is relevant to Iraq and \nSyria. The execution of French citizen Herv\u00e9 Gourdel \nin Algeria underscores the need to strengthen the fight \nagainst terrorism in all its forms.\n\nThe earth-shattering developments that affect the \nlives of people in the Middle East add new questions \nwith regard to the uninterrupted role played by the \ninternational community vis-\u00e0-vis the tragedy inflicted \nupon the brotherly Palestinian people. The history of \nhumankind shows that armed conflicts give rise to \nother conflicts and that only by working towards justice \nwithin law and morality can we find lasting solutions. \nThe Palestinian question and the Syrian crisis must \nbe approached along those lines. I should also like to \navail myself of this opportunity to pay homage to the \nefforts of my compatriot, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and to \nreiterate our support to his successor, Mr. Staffan de \nMistura.\n\n\nThe ninth Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons should \nfocus on the close, complementary nature of the \nobjectives of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons and the promotion of the peaceful uses of the \natom. Let there be no doubt that much remains to be \ndone when it comes to freeing the world of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n\nAlgeria, as a member of the Human Rights Council, \nis motivated by a strong sense of responsibility to \nparticipate actively in the promotion of the universal and \ninterdependent nature of human rights. The President \nof the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Bouteflika, and \nthe Algerian authorities are working hard to improve \nthe living conditions of Algerian citizens in many \ndifferent areas. We have laws that criminalize violence \nagainst women and children, and we are strengthening \nthe protection of the rights of divorced women and \nother legislative efforts that add to our political and \ninstitutional success in supporting Algerian women. \nWe have been addressing such matters in our elected \nbodies and our central Government.\n\nThe celebration in 2015 of the seventieth anniversary \nof the United Nations should be an opportunity to \nrenew the commitment of all Member States to bring \nnew and stronger vigour, efficacy and credibility to \nmultilateralism. We have the joint responsibility to \nwork to establish a world that is safer and fairer and \nshows more solidarity. This powerful juncture, at \nwhich we bring together all of our peoples within the \nfold of our founding values, should also be confirmed \nby action. There are apprehensions, uncertainties and \nchallenges tied to fear and need, but if we face up to \nthem the United Nations will certainly live up to its \nrole as the last haven for the hope of humankind in a \nbetter future.\n"

        "file_text": "What an honour it is to be at the General Assembly and to \nrepresent Ecuador and our citizens\u2019 revolution. I \nwould like to begin by congratulating President Sam \nKutesa on his election to lead the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. I want him to know that he \nwill have the full support of the delegation of Ecuador \nduring his tenure. Similarly, I want to express Ecuador\u2019s \nappreciation and gratitude to our brother John Ashe for \nhis work at the head of the General Assembly. I wish \nto convey the brotherly greetings and solidarity of \nPresident Rafael Correa, Minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o and \nthe citizens\u2019 revolution.\n\nFour years ago today, Ecuador suffered an \nattempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in which there was an attempt \nagainst the life of the President of the Republic, Rafael \nCorrea Delgado. Four years ago, democracy in Ecuador \nwas threatened, but it prevailed. The international \ncommunity\u2019s condemnation was immediate. Countries, \nparticularly those in the region, and the United Nations \nand other international organizations supported the \nmillions of Ecuadorians who took to the streets and \nsquares of my country, condemning the use of violence, \nrejecting the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, channelling the aspirations \nof all sectors of the population and consolidating \ndemocracy in my country.\n\nI would like to convey my appreciation to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who immediately \nmade statements bringing that issue to the world\u2019s \nattention and sent a special mission to Ecuador to \nassess the situation. The effective work of Assistant \nSecretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco and his \nteam deserves to be remembered and appreciated.\n\nDemocracy in Ecuador was strengthened, the coup \nplotters were isolated and the law and the will of the \npeople, as expressed at the ballot box, prevailed over \nthe interests of small, but powerful, groups, which \nwere then left behind in history. On the night of \n30 September 2010, all the Heads of State of the Union \nof South American Nations (UNASUR) met in Buenos \nAires to support the Ecuadorian Government and \nPresident Rafael Correa. As a result of that meeting, the \n12 countries of South America adopted an additional \nprotocol to the Constitutive Treaty of UNASUR, which \nadded a democratic clause that seeks to discourage a \nbreakdown of, or threat to, democracy in the region. In \nEcuador and in South America we are not returning to \nthe past; we cannot return to the past. The use of force \nas a means of expression and of resolving differences \nwill not return. That became clear on 30 September \n2010. We have chosen the path of law and dialogue to \nbuild a better world and future for our peoples.\n\nThe Government of Ecuador \u2014 the Government \nof the citizens\u2019 revolution \u2014 has suggested the \nimplementation of a radical change in the State\u2019s \nstructures and its political and development model. \nEcuador\u2019s position internationally is therefore in \nline with that reality. \u201cSumak Kawsay\u201d, which in \nthe language of our ancestors means \u201cliving well\u201d, is \nbuilt on a daily basis through a new model based on a \nsocially inclusive and supportive economy, supported \nthrough a citizen-based democracy and sustained in \nits planning. The changes made by the Government of \nthe citizens\u2019 revolution in Ecuador are clearly in line \nwith the Millennium Development Goals and the post-\n2015 agenda and reflect the values encapsulated in the \nHuman Development Index of the United Nations. Let \nme briefly mention some of the achievements of the \ncitizens\u2019 revolution over the past seven and a half years.\n\nApproximately 1,136,000 Ecuadorians \u2014 10 per \ncent of the population \u2014 have been lifted out of poverty. \nWe reduced the rate of unemployment to 4.9 per cent in \n2013, which is the lowest in Latin America. We have \nmaintained a policy of wage increases, and Ecuador \nnow has the highest rates in real values in the region. \nMoreover, Ecuador is the leader in Latin America \nand the Caribbean in reducing inequality, which is a \nmajor problem afflicting our region. The country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness is no longer based on labour scarcity or \nexploitation, but rather on public investment in roads, \nports, airports, telecommunications, power generation \nand systems of justice and security for our citizens. \nPublic investment in Ecuador is the highest in the \ncontinent, at 15 per cent of our gross domestic product \n(GDP) in 2013 \u2014 three times the Latin American \naverage. Thanks to that effort, we have moved up \n15 places in terms of our competitiveness, according to \nthe World Economic Forum.\n\n\n\nWe have universal basic education, which fulfils \none of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Child \nand youth labour have been substantially reduced. \nThere are 82 public schools that have been registered \nwith the International Baccalaureate Organization, and \nit is expected that, by 2017, 500 schools will offer the \nInternational Baccalaureate. Thanks to the educational \nchanges under way in Ecuador, 179,290 students have \nmoved from the private education system to the public \neducation system. In other words, in the past two years, \n19 per cent of students left private schools to study in \nState schools. As I said, we are experiencing a true \nrevolution in education.\n\nEcuador has invested some 2 per cent of our GDP \nin higher education, which is more than double the \naverage for Latin America. In the seven and a half \nyears it has been in office, the Government of Ecuador \nhas funded 8,000 scholars abroad, most of whom are \nenrolled in masters and doctoral programmes at the \nbest universities in the world. That represents the \nlargest investment in scholarships in terms of GDP in \nLatin America.\n\nI have mentioned all those achievements of our \ncitizens\u2019 revolution \u2014 and many more exist, but I \ncannot mention them owing to a lack of time \u2014 because \nthose achievements were at stake on 30 September \n2010, four years ago today. Those advances were made \npossible because democracy prevailed and because the \nGovernment of Ecuador continues to work for the well-\nbeing of its people.\n\nThe most important challenge facing the Ecuadorian \nState, along with the fight against poverty, is changing \nits economy, and that means changing the production \nmatrix of our country. To ensure sustainability in our \ndomestic and production model, we are committed to \nboosting our productive development, trade flows and \nnon-speculative foreign direct investment in target \nsectors, such as technology transfers and the financing \nof strategic projects. The fundamental objective \nof Ecuador\u2019s foreign policy is therefore to assist in \npromoting the internal development of the country, \nbalancing that with its international relations. That \nmeans expanding its political, trade, economic and \nsocial networks with an alternative and complementary \nview of the integration scheme that the country has \ntraditionally had at the global level.\n\nEcuador reiterates its concern with regard to \nthe challenge of global warming. As we change our \nproduction and energy model, my country is promoting \nthe generation of renewable energy sources with fewer \ngreenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, the \nmass use of induction cookers and the optimization of \nthe use of raw materials, reducing waste as much as \npossible. However, the ability of developing countries \nto meet the goals of a post-2015 development agenda \nis directly proportionate to developed countries\u2019 \ncontinuing provision of resources aimed at the timely \nimplementation of plans and projects for addressing \nnatural disasters caused by weather events exacerbated \nby human activity, based on the principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities.\n\nMy country was grateful for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s invitation to the Climate Summit held here \non 23 September. We are pleased with the decisions \nsome developed countries have made on their national \nplans for mitigating and adapting to climate change, \nparticularly the announcement by some, including \nFrance, that they would be increasing the capitalization \nof the Green Climate Fund. Despite those efforts, the \nFund will not reach its target of $15 billion by the end \nof the year. We, the developing world, would like to see \nmore ambitious national plans and policies on the part \nof the developed countries if the global consequences \nof this irrefutable scientific reality are to be addressed.\n\nEcuador\u2019s foreign policy is now making it a priority \nto strengthen South-South relations with a view to the \nsovereign integration of our peoples and the creation \nof new areas for regional governance. In that regard, \nEcuador is working to achieve harmonious South \nAmerican and Latin American integration, to build a \nmultipolar world and to democratize our international \norganizations, with the goal of creating a more just and \nequitable world order. We are promoting multilateralism \nand working on innovative integration processes, \ncooperation for development and a harmonious political \ndialogue. In that context, UNASUR, the Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America and the \nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \n(CELAC) are very relevant entities and are national \npriorities in our efforts to create improved integration \nmechanisms.\n\nRegarding UNASUR, I am pleased to announce \nthat its new headquarters will soon open in Quito, at the \ncentre of the world, the point where two hemispheres \nand the South American brotherhood meet. In January \n2015 Ecuador will take over the rotating chairship of \nCELAC, with the purpose of reinvigorating the regional \nintegration agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean \n\n\n\nand furthering our political cooperation, while \ncontinuing to base integration on respect for pluralism \nand States\u2019 diversity. The Government of Ecuador \ninitiated the creation of this integration mechanism, \nand it has been a major undertaking. CELAC does \nnot exclude any Latin American or Caribbean State; \nwe have firmly rejected unilateral embargoes and \nsanctions, and our ongoing struggle is about fighting \ninequality and poverty.\n\nWe must overcome and end injustice. It is therefore \nunacceptable that the United States of America\u2019s \nblockade of our sister Republic of Cuba has been \ngoing on for more than 50 years, and that despite the \nfact that Cuba has been supported by the Assembly for \n21 years. We also condemn Cuba\u2019s inclusion in the list \nof countries that sponsor terrorism.\n\nWe would like to reiterate once more that we must \ncall for a settlement through dialogue of the conflict over \nArgentina\u2019s Malvinas Islands. The United Kingdom \nshould comply with the more than 40 resolutions \nadopted by the Assembly on the subject. We also support \nArgentina in its efforts to address the pernicious effects \nof speculative hedge funds. Argentina is not alone in \nthat fight, and it can count on the backing and solidarity \nof Ecuador and our entire region.\n\nConcerning Palestine, I would like to state that on \n17 July the Government of Ecuador firmly condemned \nIsrael\u2019s military incursion into Palestinian territory \nand called for an immediate end to Israel\u2019s military \noperations and the indiscriminate attacks on the \ncivilian population in the Gaza Strip. My country has \nappealed to the international community to shoulder \nits responsibility for preventing such indiscriminate \nattacks in the interests of saving innocent lives and \nmaintaining international peace and security. As proof \nof our support for the Palestinian cause, Ecuador \ndecided to establish a diplomatic presence there, and \nit is now up and running in Ramallah. Meanwhile, \njust a few days ago we sent humanitarian assistance to \nGaza, and we will shortly send a second humanitarian \nassistance convoy there for the use of the Palestinian \nnational authorities.\n\nIn 2016 Ecuador will host the Africa-South \nAmerica Summit, a responsibility requiring considerable \npreparation and providing an opportunity to draw \nup joint policies that unite us with our African \nbrothers. The time has come to further strengthen the \nrelationship between Africa and Latin America, and \nEcuador has therefore decided to open new embassies \nin Algeria, Nigeria and Angola in the near future. We \nwill also strengthen our existing embassies in Africa, \nand we will be opening additional diplomatic missions \nthere in a second phase. We intend to work with our \nAfrican brothers for our mutual benefit and shared \nopportunities.\n\nFor Ecuador, it is a source of pride and a heavy \nresponsibility to be hosting the forthcoming third \nUnited Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable \nUrban Development, Habitat III, in 2016. Thus in one \nyear, 2016, we will host the meetings of the CELAC \nHeads of State, the Africa-South America Summit and \nHabitat III.\n\nFor over a year, we have undertaken intensive work \nto address the main issues stemming from the rapid \nurban growth that we have seen in our countries, issues \nthat were raised at the most recent World Urban Forum, \nlast April in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. We hope to continue \nto generate synergies in order to move towards a new \nglobal agenda for sustainable urban development that \nwe will take up at Habitat III.\n\nThe Government of Ecuador, in its efforts to build \na just and equitable society, has sought in recent years \nto implement a system of rights in terms of habitat \nand urban development. The principle guiding its \naction \u2014 \u201cthe right to the city\u201d \u2014 is understood not as \na unitary right, but as a set of interrelated rights linked \nto the land. Policies for habitat, human settlements and \nhousing are expressions of the State\u2019s aspiration to \nbuild, as I mentioned, a society of living well, through \npublic regulation in line with the concept that Ecuador \npromotes, namely, harmony with nature. Ecuador \nis the only country in the world that sets forth in its \nConstitution \u201cthe right to nature\u201d.\n\nWith respect to the reform of the United Nations \nsystem, Ecuador has actively and constructively made \nprofound and comprehensive proposals for change \nin some international organizations, with a view to \nmaking them more efficient, democratic, participatory \nand inclusive. We aspire to their universalization and \ntransparency, as well as to increased and equitable \nrepresentation, consultation and decision-making on the \npart of all States, especially the developing countries. \nConsistent with that, the Government of Ecuador has \nadvocated the reform of the global governance system, \nin order to democratize decision-making and improve \ntransparency in the management of all multilateral \norganizations. Many Members of this Organization join \nus in that approach.\n\n\n\nEcuador proposes marking a turning point with \nrespect to the United Nations system, as with its current \nstructure it is not addressing the international tensions \nand disputes or the troubled international situation. \nEcuador seeks to democratize the Security Council, \nwhich should be composed of clusters, in order to \nfind a balance, ensure representativity and protect the \nprinciple of the equality of States. Only in that way \ncan the Council play its role in maintaining peace and \ninternational security.\n\nWe are at the threshold of the seventieth anniversary \nof the United Nations. We have a historical obligation \nto modernize and democratize the Organization, \nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly in \nsuch decision-making as the election of judges to the \nInternational Court of Justice and the election of the \nSecretary-General.\n\nAt present, we are concerned that, despite the \nprogress made in 2014, a great many threats continue \nto loom over humankind. Situations of armed conflict, \nhumanitarian crises, violations of human rights \nand breaches of international law threaten entire \npopulations, demanding an urgent response from the \ninternational community. The Government of Ecuador \nhas expressed its conviction regarding the need to \nrespect international law and reach negotiated and \npeaceful solutions. It has totally rejected all forms \nof interference and unilateral action that violate the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States, trample \non human rights or disregard international law. We also \nstrongly condemn all terrorist acts, whether perpetrated \nby irregular groups or in the name of a State. Ecuador \nhas condemned the actions of the Islamic State in both \nIraq and Syria.\n\nThose global challenges must be dealt with by \nthe United Nations, as the most appropriate forum to \naddress and respond to the difficult situations that we \nare facing. It will surely have the support and solidarity \nof all Member States.\n\nLet us endeavour to ensure that international law is \nthe standard that governs our actions. A few months ago, \nin this very Hall, Member States adopted a resolution \nwhich called for respect for the right to privacy in the \ndigital age (resolution 68/167). The same label has \nbeen applied to another abuse \u2014 global surveillance. \nOnce again we are in a situation where we are being \nmonitored and spied on. Ecuador, along with several \nother countries, co-sponsored a draft resolution put \nforward by Germany and Brazil and, with the adoption \nof that legal instrument, a new process for defining \nhuman rights \u2014 the right to privacy \u2014 was initiated. \nThe resolution, adopted by consensus, constitutes a \nrejection of an abusive posture. The abuse was brought \nto our attention by an Australian citizen who felt that \nthe world should know what was being done with \nsovereignty.\n\nThe decision of that Australian citizen led to \nthe harshest persecution, which caused him to seek \nprotection for his life in the light of the real threats he \nhad received. I am referring to Julian Assange, who is \nnow associated with Ecuador because, after reviewing \nthe merits of his case, we granted him asylum. Two \nyears have passed in the new life of Mr. Assange, two \nyears without freedom of movement, two years in \nwhich he has been confined to a small space waiting \nfor justice. There it is again, Sir, that dream of justice.\n\nWhen asylum is granted, it is primarily by \nimmediate recognition and respect for a fundamental \nhuman right \u2014 the right to life. What has been difficult \nis convincing the counterpart \u2014 the United Kingdom \nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2014 that in this \nsituation the fundamental human rights of Julian \nAssange should be taken into account. Ecuador will \ncontinue to work tirelessly to find a solution in this \ncase. To that end, we hope to have the support of the \nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \nand the Kingdom of Sweden.\n\nI appeal to the Kingdom of Sweden to enforce \none of the most important legal principles recognized \ninternationally and by the Swedish legal system: \neffective judicial protection. After four years, the \nProsecutor\u2019s Office of that country has been unable \nto take statements from Julian Assange, even though \nunder Swedish law this could have been done in another \ncountry, even though Ecuador repeatedly offered its \njudicial cooperation, and even though Julian Assange\u2019s \nlawyers expressed their willingness to cooperate.\n\nTurning to another subject, and with this I will \nconclude my statement, I would like to speak about \ntransnational corporations. In recent years, there have \nbeen increased demands brought by transnational \ncorporations in international arbitration courts against \nthe States and peoples of the South. Those multimillion \ndollar disputes, such as the Chevron-Texaco case in \nEcuador, threaten the tax resources and jeopardize the \nvalidity and legitimacy of the national jurisdiction of the \nStates concerned. The scale of the problem could even \ncompromise the development plans of the countries of \n\n\n\nthe South, in Latin America and other regions of the \nworld.\n\nIn that context, we are also establishing, within the \nframework of UNASUR, a regional arbitration centre \nthat will, inter alia, provide legal advice in investment \ndisputes. We are also creating a code of conduct for \narbitrators and mediators within UNASUR. And we \nare establishing, with other regions of the world, an \nobservatory on transnational corporations. All of that is \naimed at creating support mechanisms that can analyse, \nmonitor and respond to States\u2019 requests so as to prevent \nand solve investment disputes. Ecuador, together with \nSouth Africa, has also submitted a proposal in the \nHuman Rights Council aimed at creating a binding \ninstrument to impose international human rights legal \nobligations on transnational corporations. For the \ntime being, a working group is being established to \nconsider that initiative. My country attaches special \nimportance to the matter, and we will work to reach an \nunderstanding with States because that is an extremely \nimportant issue. We are confident that we will have the \nStates\u2019 full support.\n\nFinally, I wish to reiterate to the Secretary-General \nEcuador\u2019s gratitude for the appointment of the former \nVice-President of the Republic, Mr. Len\u00edn Voltaire \nMoreno Garc\u00e9s, as Special Envoy on Disability and \nAccessibility. Ecuador will continue to support all \ninitiatives of the Organization to promote and protect \nthe rights of people with disabilities and their families.\n\nAt the beginning of my statement, I pointed out \nsome achievements of the citizens\u2019 revolution in the \npast seven and a half years. The changes brought about \nhave had a profound impact and have caused a historic \ntransformation. My country also wishes to work with all \nMember States to achieve a true transformation of the \nUnited Nations. We have enormous challenges ahead \nto promote development, maintain peace and reduce \ninequality and poverty. Ecuador is fully committed \nto working together on that historic task. I hope to \nsee fellow Member States in the Hall next year at the \nseventieth session of the General Assembly, when we \ncan then celebrate important decisions that we have \ntaken.\n"

        "file_text": "I \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, former \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly. We wish \nhim the greatest success in carrying out his duties.\n\nWhirlwinds of oppression and violence, anxiety, \ndesperation and the systematic violation of human rights \naffect many corners of the world. We are witnessing an \nupsurge in violence and armed confrontations and an \nincrease in atrocious crimes and extremism with an ever \nincreasing number of displaced persons, humanitarian \ncrises and deplorable acts that remain unpunished.\n\nWe are also concerned in particular about the \nuniversal dimension of the crisis caused by the Islamic \nState in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). That reality requires \nthe coordinated and forceful multilateral action of \nthe international community in accordance with the \nrelevant bodies of the Organization. We have seen \nthe images and heard the screams of pain and distress \nrising out of Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan, \nMali, Libya, the Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and the \nCentral African Republic. The cries can also be heard \nin Central America, where thousands of children and \nyoung people cross borders alone heading towards the \nUnited States of America, fleeing violence and a lack \nof opportunities in pursuit of dreams that can turn into \nnightmares. The Assembly can never put aside the \nfuture of those children because, in many ways, the \ngirls and boys of Central America who travel alone are \nalso our sons and daughters.\n\nCosta Ricans are not indifferent to the terror \nof armed conflicts, less still to the suffering of the \nmillions of victims of its most abject manifestations. As \na nation, we have always stood with our sister nations \nin our efforts to bring an end to war and to establish \npeace. The conflicts that torment us often emerge from \nthe fragile situations of States and their institutions: \nextreme poverty, corruption and impunity. In all of \nthem, serious human rights violations have occurred. \nNone of those conflicts broke out without prior \nwarning. Ther were clear warning signs. In some cases, \nthe threat was identified but no action was taken, as in \nSyria. In other cases, the danger was not acknowledged \nin time, as in South Sudan. However, in all such cases, \nthe victims are those who are most vulnerable and most \nneed our help but who cannot make their voice heard. \nThey are the reason that we are here today.\n\nFaced with the loss of human lives, we have reason \nto ask ourselves if we have kept the solemn promise \nthat accompanied the founding of the United Nations \n69 years ago. Do all Members of the Organization refrain \nfrom resorting to the threat or use of force against the \nterritorial integrity or political independence of other \nStates? In some cases, that is so, in others not, but the \nfailure to act is unacceptable. When States disregard \nthat promise, the system of the United Nations is called \nto action. Otherwise, it becomes weak. It loses its \nessence. It loses its spirit.\n\nThe greatest challenge facing the international \ncommunity, the United Nations and the Security \nCouncil \u2014 the challenge I wish to talk about \ntoday \u2014 is maintaining international peace and \nsecurity as essential common goods. If we want peace, \nwe must prepare for peace. Maintaining international \npeace and security begins with a culture of peace. As \nan unarmed democracy and home to the University for \nPeace, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights \nand the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Costa \nRica believes that the culture of peace and education for \npeace must be an absolute priority. We are convinced \nthat peace, like war, is not the product of a human or an \nhistoric destiny but is borne of the very freedom of the \nhuman being.\n\nMaintaining international peace and security is not \nrestricted to dealing with conflicts. The Organization \nwas founded on the ashes of two world wars precisely \nin order to prevent them. Prevention begins at the \nState level, with the strengthening of democracy and \nits institutions, good governance and a social welfare \nState founded of the rule of law as a basic prerequisite \nfor the promotion of development and fair and inclusive \nsocieties. Prevention is also founded on a solid and \nfunctioning multilateral system. Costa Rica values \nand encourages the preventive diplomatic measures \nprovided for in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \nNations, which include mediation, good offices and \nearly warning.\n\nAs part of the Group of Friends of Mediation, \nI would like to highlight Costa Rica\u2019s leadership in \nnegotiating General Assembly resolution 68/303, \nwhich seeks to acknowledge the key role that regional \nand subregional organizations play in mediating and \nmanaging conflicts. To date, that is the first General \nAssembly resolution on mediation to recognize that \n\nrole. Its inclusion is therefore a true achievement of the \nGeneral Assembly.\n\nMaintaining international peace and security \nrequires all States to resolve our disputes peacefully in \nline with the Charter of the United Nations and in strict \naccordance with international law and agreements. Costa \nRica firmly believes in and implements all aspects of \ninternational law. We therefore underscore in particular \nthe role of the International Court of Justice and the \nInternational Criminal Court. Peace cannot take root \nwhere there is impunity. When war crimes, genocide \nand crimes against humanity have been committed, \nthose responsible must be investigated and put on trial, \nincluding by the International Criminal Court when the \nnational jurisdiction proves insufficient.\n\nOur country opposes the weakening of the Rome \nStatute and any proposed reform that could promote \ntolerance for impunity. Once again, we remind the \nSecurity Council of its authority and responsibility \nto refer to the International Criminal Court cases that \noccur in non-States parties. That is the only approach \nwe recognize. Our only weapon is and will always be \ninternational law.\n\nMaintaining international peace and security \nalso necessitates strengthening the single global \nOrganization charged with defending them. The \nSecurity Council must progress from a reaction \nmentality towards one of action, and reaffirm its moral \nand political commitment to all humankind. It must be \nvigilant, strategic and proactive. It must be democratic, \nefficient, transparent and inclusive. My country has \nobjected to the use of the veto to obstruct measures \naimed at preventing or resolving conflict. Costa Ricans \nare amazed by the way some permanent Council \nmembers have invoked the principal of sovereignty to \nblock intervention by the Council at a moment when it \nshould have acted to prevent rivers from turning red \nwith the blood of innocent victims.\n\nWe reiterate our call on the permanent members \nto refrain from using the veto, especially in situations \nof genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and \nmass human rights violations. We therefore welcome \nthe French proposal for a code of conduct addressing \nthe use of the veto. In that spirit, Costa Rica supports \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Rights Up Front Action \nPlan so as to place human rights at the centre of the \nprevention activities of the United Nations. Given our \nserious and unshakeable commitment to human rights, \nI respectfully ask the Assembly to back Costa Rica\u2019s \nre-election to the Human Rights Council in October.\n\nOur poet Jorge Debravo said that we Costa Ricans\n\n\u201chave the obligation to fight for a better future for \nman, for a wonderful future. It is not an option for \nus to remain silent. It is not an option for us to be \nobservers or simple witnesses to the struggles of \nour nations. In a time like this, remaining neutral is \nto betray humanity\u2019s future\u201d.\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we condemn \nthe indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas \nand its use of human shields, just as we condemn the use \nof disproportionate force in military operations carried \nout by the Israel Defense Forces. We demand respect \nfor the ceasefire and the negotiation of a permanent \nsolution based on two States living side by side in peace \nand harmony.\n\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we reject the \ntransfer of conventional weapons to existing conflict \nzones. As one of the world leaders in the negotiations \nthat led to the Arms Trade Treaty \u2014 an idea originally \nproposed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former-\nPresident \u00d3scar Arias S\u00e1nchez \u2014 we urge States to \nreconsider their laws and policies regulating the transfer \nand availability of arms and munitions, with a view \nto preventing access by those who would use them in \nviolating human rights and international humanitarian \nlaw. To trade in death is to become an accomplice to \natrocities. In that context, it would be appropriate to \nask the Assembly: What is the ethical \u2014 not legal or \nregulatory \u2014 difference between trafficking arms \nthat kill young people in less-developed countries and \ntrafficking in drugs that lead to the same result in the \nplanet\u2019s richest countries?\n\nBecause silence is not an option for us, Costa \nRica rejects the use of explosive weapons in densely \npopulated areas of Syria, Gaza and eastern Ukraine. \nCosta Rica urgently calls on Member States to develop \nstricter rules and commitments to prohibit and restrict \ntheir use, not only because they violate international \nhumanitarian law, but also because taking action on that \nissue, here and now, is critical to reducing incentives to \nnon-combatants to take up arms and join the extremists.\n\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we also \ncondemn the use of cluster munitions in Syria, South \nSudan and eastern Ukraine. As the host of the Fifth \nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster \n\n\nMunitions, which took place in San Jose from 2 to \n5 September, my country will continue to reject the \nmanufacture, use and trade of those weapons. We \nrejoice that our beloved Central America has become \nthe first region of the world to be declared free of cluster \nmunitions, and reiterate our commitment to continuing \nto promote the Convention\u2019s universalization.\n\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we reiterate \nour rejection of nuclear weapons. No State should \ndevelop or possess nuclear weapons. Maintaining and \nupdating nuclear weapons requires immense economic \nand human resources that are necessary for responding \nto the key challenges of our time, such as achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable \ndevelopment goals. Costa Rica is ready to negotiate a \nnew, legally binding instrument on nuclear disarmament \nand calls on States to honour their commitments in that \nregard.\n\nThere can be no peace without sustainable \ndevelopment. There can be no peace in the world so \nlong as there is poverty. There can be no peace in the \npresence of extreme wealth disparity. There can be no \npeace while we destroy humankind\u2019s habitat. There \ncan be no peace while large sectors of humankind \nlack guaranteed access to drinking water. There can \nbe no peace so long as we fail to understand that all \nof humankind and Planet Earth\u2019s biodiversity can and \nmust thrive and live together. There can be no peace \nwhile we fail to guarantee all human rights \u2014 civil, \ncultural, economic, political and social \u2014 and in \nparticular the right to development.\n\nBecause we yearn for peace, we call on the \nnations of the world to join us in defining the post-\n2015 development agenda. In just one year\u2019s time, \nthe General Assembly will be tasked with adopting \nthe international framework for achieving sustainable \ndevelopment. The challenge we will face is colossal; \nwe must therefore humbly acknowledge that, despite \nprogress, the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals has been, at best, insufficient.\n\nI am convinced that the new sustainable development \nagenda must be a tool primed for action, with precise \nobjectives, clear targets and indicators that will allow us \nto measure and monitor its success. In addition, it must \nresult from a broad international consensus, including \nopen and transparent negotiation processes that involve \nnot only the Member States, but also other international \nactors and civil society organizations whose experience \nwill significantly enrich the final agreement.\n\nWe are facing the most serious threat in our \nhistory \u2014 the very survival of our species. Actions \ntaken to confront it must not be timid. On the contrary, \nevery public policy, national and international alike, \nmust take climate change into account as a determining \nfactor. Costa Rica celebrates the vision of the Secretary-\nGeneral in convening the Climate Summit at the \nopening of this session. Now is the time to demonstrate \nour political commitment to achieving a legally binding \ninstrument on climate change by 2015. In addition, we \ndemand robust action on the part of those countries that \ncontribute most to global warming. Their production \nand consumption methods must be completely revised \nas their impact on the planet\u2019s most impoverished \npeople \u2014 the ones most affected by climate change \u2014 is \nundeniable. If humankind is to survive, we must reverse \nthe current trend.\n\nThree years ago, 33 countries came together to \nestablish the Community of Latin American and \nCaribbean States (CELAC). Its agenda is underpinned \nby full respect for the purposes and principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations and international law. \nIts objective is to build diverse, equitable, fair and \negalitarian societies, where eradicating poverty and \nhunger are given priority status. I salute the nations, \nmembers of this community.\n\nIn an international context of increasing military \ntension and armed conflict, and with the realization \nthat a region\u2019s prosperity and stability can contribute \nto international peace and security, CELAC member \nStates have declared Latin America and the Caribbean \na zone of peace. As President Pro Tempore of CELAC, \nCosta Rica reiterates its commitment to preventive \ndiplomacy and the peaceful resolution of disputes, \nwith the aim of forever eradicating both the use and the \nthreat of force from our region.\n\nCosta Rica trusts that the United Nations will \nmaintain international peace and security in order to \npromote sustainable development and ensure genuine \nrespect for all human rights. At a time when we must \ncontrol the reflexive use of coercive measures as a \nfirst course of action, when anxiety and despair are \nunsettling many, it is essential to re-establish hope. \nWhen faced with fear, we must have confidence. When \nfaced with conflict, we must turn to peace. When faced \nwith rejection and prejudice on the part of others, we \nmust offer a caring and fraternal embrace. When faced \nwith death, we must think of life.\n\nWith faith in dialogue and consultation, I have \ncome to the General Assembly to ask that we declare \n\n\npeace \u2014 that we conscientiously and decisively work \ntogether towards a culture and education for peace; \ntowards strengthening of the social State based on \nthe rule of law, as well as its institutions and our \neconomies; towards conflict prevention and resolution \nof international controversies by peaceful means; \ntowards a renewed role for the Security Council; \ntowards an end to and a reversal of climate change; and \ntowards sustainable development from which not one \nperson in the world is excluded.\n\nI have come to tell the Assembly that silence is \nnot an option for us. We must raise our voices when \nconfronted with actions and situations that go against \nthe universal principles enshrined in the Charter of \nthe United Nations. I have come to inspire us to work \ntogether on new paradigms for sustainable development, \nhuman security and peace for the whole world.\n\nThe Costa Rican poet Julieta Dobles Yzaguirre \nwondered: \u201cWill the Earth in the new millennium/ \nbecome that common home?\u201d I would like to respond to \nthe poet with her own words: \u201cNo one is saved alone./ \nPerhaps in sharing words and actions/ peace will finally \nbreak out.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I \nshould like to congratulate the President on his election, \nwhich testifies to the strong commitment of Africa to \nthe United Nations and to multilateralism. I also wish \nto express my appreciation for the dedication to the \nAssembly of his predecessor Ambassador John Ashe. I \nreiterate my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his \nleadership at the helm of our Organization and for his \nrelentless efforts in favour of peace in such a difficult \nand complex time in international life. I commend him \nalso for convening the Climate Summit, which has \nrenewed political support for the achievement in 2015 of \na fair, universal and legally binding climate agreement. \nPortugal, and the European Union as a whole, will \ncontinue to work tirelessly and in an inclusive manner \ntowards the achievement of that goal.\n\nDuring this session, we face the enormous challenge \nof renewing and building upon the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), with a view to adopting \nthe post-2015 development agenda. The President may \ncount on the support and commitment of Portugal on that \nand other issues and in the ongoing work of the General \nAssembly, which is the first home of multilateralism \nand of legitimate international collective action. The \ncommitment of Portugal to the United Nations, to the \nCharter and to its principles and values is firm, resolute \nand enduring.\n\nAt this Assembly session, Portugal is a candidate \nfor the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 term. \nWe hope to have the support of all members in the \nupcoming election. If elected, Portugal will be serving \nfor the first time as a member of such an important \nbody.\n\nLast April Portugal underwent its second Universal \nPeriodic Review by the Human Rights Council. Our \npositive national human rights record was widely \nacknowledged. Portugal has actively participated in \nmultilateral human rights forums, in particular in the \nHuman Rights Council, submitting annual resolutions \non the right to education and on economic, social and \ncultural rights. We hope to be able to make an even \ngreater contribution to the Human Rights Council over \nthe coming three years, as we deeply believe in the \nCouncil\u2019s ability to strengthen the capacity of States to \ncomply with their human rights obligations.\n\nIn that context, Portugal has submitted a bold set of \npledges and commitments that will guide the discharge \nof our mandate with the purpose of promoting and \nprotecting the universality, indivisibility, inalienability \nand interdependence of all human rights \u2014 civil, \ncultural, economic, political and social. Through our \n\nactions during our last mandate in the Security Council, \nin 2011 and 2012, we demonstrated that consistently \npromoting and upholding human rights was a priority \nfor us. If elected to the Human Rights Council, Portugal \nwill engage in its work, fully committed to a strong, \nindependent and effective multilateral human rights \nsystem. Portugal is in fact a party without reservations \nto eight core United Nations human rights treaties and \nall their optional protocols.\n\nWe continue to witness events that we expected to \nsee eradicated in the twenty-first century \u2014 large-scale \nhuman rights violations, the deprivation of vast \npopulations of their most elementary dignity, and a \ndisregard for basic international principles such as the \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of States. Today \nthe Charter of the United Nations remains as relevant \nas it was 69 years ago. In order to deal with the crises \nwe face today we must base our search for fair, legal \nand lasting solutions on the generous and ambitious \nprinciples and norms of the Charter. The Charter \noffers the necessary institutional mechanisms, but their \nfunctioning and effectiveness depend on the political \nwill of all Members of the Organization.\n\nTerrorist, extremist and radical groups deserve our \nmost vehement repudiation and condemnation. They \nconstitute, in the first instance, a threat to States and to \nthe populations of the territories in which they are based. \nThey also present a risk to regional and global peace, \nsecurity and stability. That menace requires concerted \nand firm responses from the international community. \nThe self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n(ISIS) is a sinister example of that kind of criminal and \nbarbaric action. It must be fought and neutralized. The \nSecurity Council summit and resolution 2178 (2014), \nwhich it adopted on the worrying phenomenon of \nforeign terrorist fighters, were important steps in that \ndirection.\n\nThe Middle East continues to require special \nattention. In Iraq we have been witnessing inhumane \nterrorist actions targeting defenceless populations, \nvictimizing mainly women, children and persons \nbelonging to ethnic and religious minorities. The \nsituation in Iraq cannot be disconnected from the \nprolonged conflict in Syria, where the levels of violence \nand suffering are, by their dimension and duration, \nbeyond words. All parties must assume responsibility \nfor finding a political transition to a democratic and \npluralistic society.\n\nOnce again we come to the Assembly without \nprogress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The \nexpectations that we all shared here a year ago have been \ndashed. The recurring cycle of hostilities must come \nto an end. The conflict we saw in Gaza this summer \nmust not happen again. I wish to take this opportunity \nto congratulate Egypt for brokering the ceasefire and to \nrecognize the efforts of other regional and international \npartners, including the Secretary-General and United \nStates Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThere will be no lasting peace or stability in \nthe Middle East without a solution to that issue. I \nreiterate my country\u2019s support for a solution based on \nUnited Nations resolutions, establishing a sovereign, \nindependent and viable Palestinian State, living side by \nside with the State of Israel, whose legitimate security \nconcerns must be guaranteed.\n\nThe positive signs that we saw a year ago regarding \nthe Iranian nuclear programme were confirmed with \nthe signing of the Joint Plan of Action in Geneva. A \nnew political impetus is now needed. Portugal supports \nand encourages the ongoing negotiations with a view to \na comprehensive agreement.\n\nThe events of 2010 and 2011 in Northern Africa \nhad an unprecedented political, economic and social \nimpact. The countries there are now confronted with \nsignificant challenges with regard to the consolidation \nof political reforms, sustainable economic growth and \nsecurity. Portugal is currently co-chairing the Western \nMediterranean Forum, also known as the 5+5 Dialogue, \nwhich brings together 10 countries from the northern \nand southern shores of the Mediterranean. We wish \nto strengthen the contribution of that platform to the \nenhancement of cooperation and confidence-building \namong its countries.\n\nLibya is an important partner in that Forum, and it \nis with great concern that we see the deterioration of the \nsituation in that country. The international community \nmust give its assistance to the political transition \nprocess, but it is paramount that all Libyan stakeholders \ncommit to an inclusive, genuine and fruitful national \ndialogue.\n\nIn Europe, the Ukrainian crisis and the illegal \nannexation of Crimea brought back tensions that we \nthought were outdated. We welcome the ceasefire \nagreement and appeal for its full implementation. \nPortugal encourages the parties actively to seek a \n\nlasting political solution that respects the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity, unity and democracy in Ukraine.\n\nAfrica is a significant partner for Portugal. \nAfrican States are not only political partners but also, \nincreasingly, business and investment partners in a \nrelationship based on parity and mutual benefits, which \ndrive job creation and economic development. While \nfully respecting Africa\u2019s ownership, we also seek to \ncontribute to international efforts, notably those of \nthe United Nations, aimed at stabilizing conflicts or \npreventing security risks in Africa. Therefore, Portugal \nis participating in the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. We also stand \nready to engage in multinational efforts to strengthen \nsecurity in the Gulf of Guinea, and we are willing \nto cooperate in the reinforcement of the maritime \ncapacities of the countries of the region.\n\nIn recent months we have received good news from \nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, a friendly country and \nmember of the Community of Portuguese-speaking \nCountries (CPLP). The restoration of constitutional \norder, the holding of free elections and the inauguration \nof legitimate democratic institutions, two years after the \nApril 2012 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, are surely praiseworthy signs of \nhope. The enormous socioeconomic difficulties and the \nrecurrent and severe political instability that Guinea-\nBissau has been suffering for a decade and a half did \nnot prevent the people from electing their new leaders \nthrough free, transparent and orderly elections.\n\nThe opportunity to turn the page of history must \nnow be seized. The people of Guinea-Bissau and the \nauthorities are taking the right steps. Consolidating the \nprogress achieved requires support from the international \ncommunity. International partners can and must play a \ndecisive role in areas such as financial assistance and \nbuilding technical capacity, underpinning the priorities \nidentified by Guinea-Bissau. Further, we believe that a \nstabilization force based on the Economic Community \nof West African States (ECOWAS) Mission in Guinea-\nBissau, possibly enlarged to incorporate new African \npartners and mandated by the United Nations, would \nbe appropriate. Therefore we welcome the initiatives \nsupporting Guinea-Bissau undertaken by the United \nNations, together with, in particular, the African Union, \nthe CPLP, ECOWAS and the European Union.\n\nAt the Millennium Summit, Heads of State and \nGovernment made the historic and inspiring decision \nto adopt the Millennium Development Goals. We now \nhave the responsibility to accelerate the achievement \nof those Goals while at the same time preparing \na new development agenda. Portugal is strongly \ncommitted to the definition of that new agenda. We \nneed a transformative new global partnership that \nmainstreams human rights and combats inequalities. It \nshould also promote peaceful, stable and just societies, \nadvancing also the important issues of population and \ndevelopment. Universality and shared responsibility \nare key concepts in that regard. But the universality of \nthe post-2015 agenda should not be synonymous with \ninsensitivity to the specificities of the least developed \nand most vulnerable countries, such as small island \ndeveloping States.\n\nNew challenges such as climate change, illicit \ntrafficking, piracy and pandemics are major threats \nin today\u2019s world. The outbreak of Ebola in Western \nAfrican countries demands strong, combined efforts by \nthe international community to contain and eradicate \nthat plague. Portugal is participating in the current \nurgent global effort, notably in Guinea and in the \nframework of the United Nations operation.\n\nDespite the efforts of previous Presidents, the \nreform of the Security Council has not yet happened. \nPortugal\u2019s position on that subject is well known. In \nspite of persistent differences of approach among the \nmembership, we must not give up. Together we must \nfind a solution, making the Security Council a body \nmore representative of today\u2019s world. The seventieth \nanniversary of the United Nations is an opportunity to \nbring about Security Council reform.\n\nPortugal is by tradition a seafaring nation and has \nrecently adopted a new national maritime strategy \nfocusing on blue growth. We actively support United \nNations efforts for the sustainable management of \nthe oceans and their resources, and we co-chair the \nworking group that will complete the first global report \nof the marine environment. We advocate the adoption \nof an international instrument, in the framework of \nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \non the conservation and sustainable use of marine \nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. In \nJune 2015 Portugal will organize a major international \nevent on oceans, the \u201cBlue Week\u201d, to promote debate \non maritime issues in all their dimensions. We look \nforward to broad participation in that event.\n\nThe Portuguese language is the principal link that \nbrings together the States belonging to the Community \nof Portuguese-speaking Countries. It is a vehicle for \nglobal communication spoken by about 250 million \n\n\npeople in their everyday lives, in commerce, trade, \nbusiness, culture and social networks. It is also an \nofficial or working language in various international \norganizations, including specialized agencies of the \nUnited Nations. The CPLP has the ambition of having \nPortuguese as an official language of the United Nations. \nThe summit in Dili last July confirmed the vitality of \nthe CPLP. On that occasion Timor-Leste assumed the \npresidency of the Community, thus lending a whole \nnew dimension and scope to the CPLP by having its \npresidency located for the first time in Asia.\n\nI would be remiss not to refer to the fact that on \n20 November we will be celebrating the twenty-fifth \nanniversary of the United Nations Convention on \nthe Rights of the Child. Portugal is a party to that \ninstrument without reservations, as well as to its three \nOptional Protocols. I take this opportunity to call for \nthe universal ratification of the Convention and its \nOptional Protocols.\n\nDuring this sixty-ninth session we will also have \nbefore us a new draft resolution on establishing a \nmoratorium on the use of the death penalty. We hope \nthe draft resolution continues to enjoy significant and \nincreased support this year.\n\nIf we become a member of the United Nations \nHuman Rights Council as we hope, we will act in \naccordance with the principles of cooperation and \ndialogue. We will engage with all States and other \nstakeholders in order to build bridges for the full \nimplementation of human rights norms and standards. \nIf we garner the trust of the Assembly, it will be a \nprivilege to work, as a Council member, with the new \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \nPrince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, to whom I reiterate our \nfull support. I also wish to pay a special tribute to the \nformer High Commissioner, Ms. Navi Pillay, for her \noutstanding job, often accomplished in particularly \ndifficult circumstances.\n\nI conclude with a reference to the First World \nWar, a tragic event mentioned at the very beginning \nof the United Nations Charter when it affirms the \ndetermination \u201cto save succeeding generations from the \nscourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought \nuntold sorrow to mankind\u201d. As we mark the centenary \nof the First World War and prepare the celebration \nof the seventieth anniversary of our Organization, \nwe must bear in mind and reflect carefully on those \nwords of the Charter. The President can count on \nPortugal\u2019s commitment to the purposes and principles \nof the Charter in the pursuit of peace, development and \nrespect for all human rights.\n"

        "file_text": "Every year, the General Assembly gives us the opportunity to \nget together to discuss our concerns in the various parts \nof the world. Here we are, meeting again to evaluate \nwhat has been accomplished and to consider new \nsolutions to the many challenges confronting our shared \nresponsibility. And Burkina Faso is committed, as \nalways, to participating in this important get-together, \nthe symbol of international solidarity.\n\nI would like to express our gratitude to \nPresident Kutesa\u2019s predecessor, Ambassador John \nAshe, for his positive record during his tenure. I also \nheartily congratulate the President on his election, \nand I am confident that his wealth of experience with \ninternational and development issues will enable \nhim to effectively guide our work on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, in order to formulate an ambitious \nnew framework for development aimed at bringing our \npeoples growth, fairness and a better life. \n\nI would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his thoughtful focus on \npeace and social and economic development around the \nworld, especially in Africa. In that regard, I welcome \nhis initiative in holding last week\u2019s Climate Summit \nin New York, aimed at persuading Heads of State and \nGovernment and representatives of local authorities, \nthe private sector and civil society of the urgent and \ncompelling need for them to declare their contributions \nto the fight against climate change in firm and concrete \nterms.\n\nBurkina Faso also reiterates its commendation of \nthe joint visit to the Sahel by the Secretary-General, \nthe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the \nPresident of the World Bank, the President of the African \nDevelopment Bank and the European Commissioner \nfor Development within the framework of the United \nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel, which aims to \npromote security, good governance, development and \nhuman rights as factors of peace and stability.\n\nLastly, Burkina Faso welcomes the Assembly\u2019s \nadoption of the Secretary-General\u2019s Ebola initiative \n(resolution 69/1) and welcomes his appointment of \nMr. David Nabarro as Senior United Nations System \nCoordinator for Ebola Virus Disease and Mr. Anthony \nBanbury as his Special Representative and Head of the \nUnited Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response. \nThese steps will certainly help the West African \nsubregion to strengthen its public-health systems in \norder to eradicate the epidemic, whose spread could \npermanently compromise the area\u2019s social cohesion, \ndevelopment and economic integration. Burkina Faso \n\nwould like to express its sympathy and solidarity with \nthe affected countries, and it reiterates its commitment \nto participating in the quest for a collective solution \nthat can ensure effective protection for the people and \nfor health personnel, as well as the free movement of \npeople and goods within the Economic Community of \nWest African States (ECOWAS).\n\nToday we can celebrate the progress made in efforts \nto achieve and maintain peace, as well as to achieve our \ndevelopment goals, despite the fact that there is still \nwork to be done to speed up improvement of our people\u2019s \nliving conditions. In Burkina Faso, notwithstanding our \nunfavourable geographical and climatic conditions and \na difficult international economic environment, we are \ncommitted, with determination and realism, to building \ndevelopment. In the last few decades, therefore, we have \nestablished and implemented strategic development \nprogrammes and plans designed to put our country \nfirmly on the road to emergence. Poverty reduction, \nthe empowerment of women and full employment for \nyoung people are some of our main objectives. For \nseveral years consecutively those efforts have enabled \nBurkina Faso to record average annual growth rates of \naround 5 per cent and achieve significant investments \nin a number of areas that include health, education, \nagriculture, and water, road and energy infrastructures.\n\nClearly, development efforts cannot thrive without \na stable, peaceful environment. To that end, our \nPresident, Mr. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, and the Government \nof Burkina Faso continue to work to entrench a culture \nof tolerance and peaceful coexistence that seeks to \nestablish, through dialogue and consultations, the \nessential elements of social cohesion, a strengthened \ndemocratic process and respect for individual and \ncollective liberties. \n\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \nBurkina Faso continues to set a good example by \nmaking the promotion and defence of human rights a \nmajor focus of its Government policy on improving the \npeople\u2019s welfare. That has been the context for the work \nof Mrs. Chantal Compaor\u00e9, a goodwill ambassador for \nthe Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices \nAffecting the Health of Women and Children, whose \ncommitment to dealing with the issue of female genital \nmutilation is an important contribution to global efforts \nto protect the rights of women and girls. Burkina Faso \nwelcomes the Human Rights Council\u2019s recent adoption \nof a draft resolution on \u201cIntensifying global efforts and \nsharing good practices to effectively eliminate female \ngenital mutilation\u201d , submitted by the African Group at \nBurkina Faso\u2019s initiative.\n\nWe are following with concern the crises and \nconflicts that unfortunately continue to plague parts \nof the world, particularly the African continent. \nHowever, under the auspices of ECOWAS, we welcome \nthe significant progress made over recent months \nin restoring peace and democracy in West Africa, \nespecially in Guinea-Bissau and Mali. \n\nWith respect to Mali, ECOWAS mediation brought \nabout the restoration of constitutional order and the \nholding of free and fair elections throughout the national \nterritory. For the continuation of the peace process in \nMali, Burkina Faso welcomes and supports the efforts \nof the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria in the \nsearch for a lasting peace solution in accordance with \nthe Preliminary Agreement signed in Ouagadougou \non 18 June 2013. That Agreement\u2019s ultimate goal is to \nrestore peace, the territorial integrity of Mali and of \nthe ECOWAS region, and cohesion among all Malian \ncommunities, in order to achieve the objectives of \nharmonious development and subregional integration. \n\nIn Mali, as elsewhere in the Sahel subregion, \narmed conflicts are becoming more complex and \nmore radicalized because of the emergence of violent \nextremism and terrorism closely associated with the \ncriminal economy, which is characterized, inter alia, by \ntrafficking in drugs, weapons and human beings. Those \nevils challenge us in our shared responsibility in the \nfight to eradicate them. It is more urgent than ever to \nwork together by focusing on preventive measures and \naddressing their root causes, namely such predisposing \nfactors as extreme poverty, youth unemployment, and \nthe denial of rights and justice. \n\nSimilarly, it is important to strengthen the rapid- \nresponse capabilities of our States and international \ncooperation in the exchange of information, in order \nto allow our defence forces and security to fight \neffectively against terrorist threats. In that regard, \nBurkina Faso expresses its deep gratitude to all partner \ncountries, especially France and the United States of \nAmerica, whose contribution to the efforts to secure the \nSahel is priceless. We would now like to reiterate our \ntotal solidarity with and full support for the people and \nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which \ncontinue to face the unprecedented rise of terrorism \nand religious intolerance. \n\n\nOther African countries are also experiencing crisis \nsituations. We are thinking in particular of Somalia, \nLibya, the Central African Republic, the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo and the Sudan. With respect to \nthe Central African Republic, Burkina Faso salutes \nthe efforts of the international mediator, President \nSassou Nguesso, and welcomes the Brazzaville Forum, \nwhich concluded with an agreement on the cessation \nof hostilities. My country supports the Transitional \nGovernment, welcomes the effective establishment \nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic \nand reiterates its readiness to contribute to efforts to \nrestore and keep peace in Central Africa. \n\nIn the light of all these crises, Burkina Faso would \nemphasize the urgent need to restore and maintain an \nenvironment of peace and stability in the countries \nconcerned, without which our development and \nintegration efforts will be in vain. In that context, no \neffort should be spared to protect peacekeepers who \nrisk their lives working to provide security and comfort \nto civilians. I would like to take this opportunity \nto reiterate our strong condemnation of intentional \nattacks against all United Nations troops in theatres of \npeacekeeping. \n\nAs it always has, Burkina Faso will continue to \nparticipate in the collective action of peacekeeping \nin countries in difficulty, in particular Darfur, Mali, \nGuinea-Bissau, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nand Haiti. We express our deep appreciation to partner \ncountries for their various forms of support in terms of \ntraining and equipment, which allow Burkinab\u00e9 troops \nto accomplish their tasks efficiently wherever they are \nsent. \n\nWith respect to conflict resolution, Burkina Faso \nadvocates dialogue and consultation, which is the basis \nfor Burkina Faso\u2019s consistent action when the President \nof our country is sought after as a mediator or facilitator. \nAccordingly, I welcome the adoption on 31 July by the \nAssembly of resolution 68/303 on \u201cStrengthening the \nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, \nconflict prevention and resolution\u201d. In that regard, my \ncountry, a member of the Group of Friends of Mediation, \nencourages the actions taken under the leadership of \nFinland and Turkey. \n\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Burkina Faso \nwelcomes the Moroccan initiative for advanced \nautonomy status in Western Sahara, which is a credible \nand realistic option for achieving a final solution \nacceptable to all. \n\nIn the Middle East, we condemn the recent \nescalation of violence which has led to many casualties \namong civilian populations. Priority should be given to \ndialogue, and we hope that the unrestricted ceasefire \nthat was signed between Palestinians and Israelis \non 26 August 2014, under the auspices of the Arab \nRepublic of Egypt, will lead to the establishment of a \ndefinitive peace between the two parties to the conflict. \nAccordingly, Burkina Faso welcomes the efforts of the \ninternational community aimed at creating a Palestinian \nState living side by side with Israel in peace, security \nand mutual respect. \n\nThe establishment of international peace and \nsecurity will be but hollow words as long as the issue \nof disarmament remains unresolved. Therefore, no \nsacrifice is too great if together we can achieve a world \nfree of nuclear weapons, a reduction in the risk of the \nproliferation of conventional weapons, and the entry \ninto force and universalization of the Arms Trade \nTreaty. \n\nTo establish a permanent basis for peace, security \nand freedom, it is also necessary to create the \nconditions for sustainable and equitable development \nfor all peoples. That is why my country reaffirms \nits strong commitment to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. We therefore have a \ndeep interest in the development process under way for \nthe sustainable development goals and the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, and we urge that special attention \nbe given to vital sectors such as agriculture, renewable \nenergy, industrialization and infrastructure. \n\nBurkina Faso reaffirms its commitment to the \nideals of the United Nations based on the principles of \npeaceful coexistence, dialogue and peaceful settlement \nof disputes. It is with conviction that we welcome and \nstrongly encourage the rapprochement of views between \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan and the dialogue that forms the basis \nfor such an approach. We favour the wider participation \nof the Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized \nagencies of the United Nations. \n\nWe salute the spirit of understanding displayed by \nthe international community in allowing the involvement \nof that country in international organizations in order to \nenable it to play a broader role on the world stage through \nits contribution to the achievement of development \n\n\ngoals, particularly in countries like Burkina Faso. \nReadmitting the Republic of China on Taiwan to our \nOrganization is worth considering. With 23 million \ninhabitants and a large economy, the Republic of China \non Taiwan has established itself as a key player in the \ninternational arena in terms of promoting peace and \ncontributing to development efforts. \n\nWith regard to Cuba, Burkina Faso reiterates its \nposition in favour of lifting the embargo in order to \nallow the Cuban people to fit harmoniously into the \nconcert of nations. \n\nConvinced of the irreplaceable role of the United \nNations in promoting multilateralism, my country \nsupports the reforms under consideration, in particular \nthose of the Security Council and the General Assembly. \nGiven the nature of the new factors in the threats to \ninternational peace and security, it is necessary and \nequitable that other continents have permanent seats \non the Security Council. That is why Burkina Faso \nendorses the African Common Position in favour of \nexpanding the number of permanent members of the \nSecurity Council to take into account the expectations \nof the African continent. \n\nWith everyone\u2019s help and moved by a spirit of \nsolidarity and sharing, we can strengthen the role of the \nUnited Nations as a genuine instrument of cooperation \nfor peace, security, justice and development. \n"

        "file_text": "This year \nmarks the centenary of the outbreak of the First World \nWar. A distinguished thinker in modern China, Yan Fu, \ndescribed the devastation caused by the war: \u201cHow sad \nthat the air is heavy with the stench of war\u201d.\n\nNext year will be the seventieth anniversary of the \nend of the Second World War. Over 2 billion people \nacross the world were affected by that calamity. In \nChina alone, the aggression committed by Japanese \nmilitarists left more than 35 million Chinese soldiers \nand civilians dead or injured.\n\nThe United Nations was established to keep the \nscourge of the two World Wars from occurring again, \nand it embodies the fervent hope of all countries for \npeace and stability. To achieve that goal, the Charter \nof the United Nations presented a grand vision of joint \nefforts to build a better world.\n\nIn this world, we should treat each other as equals. \nThe principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \nmust be upheld. The pursuit by different countries of \neconomic and social development must be respected. \nTheir right to independently choose their own social \nsystems and development paths must be safeguarded. \nWe should be open and inclusive. Only in that way \ncan we open the door of dialogue and exchange and \nachieve harmony among countries with different social \nsystems, religions and cultural traditions. We should \npursue mutually beneficial cooperation. Each country \nshould align its own interests with those of others and \nwork to maximize areas where their interests converge.\n\nOnly by helping one another can countries prosper. \nWe should jointly initiate a new thinking for win-win \nand all-win progress and reject the old notion of a zero-\nsum game, or the winner takes all. We should uphold \njustice. It is imperative to promote greater democracy \nand the rule of law in international relations, to apply \nfair and just rules to tell right from wrong and settle \ndisputes, and to pursue peace and development within \nthe framework of international law. All parties should \njointly uphold the authority and effectiveness of the \nUnited Nations and reform and improve the global \ngovernance structure.\n\nAs we have seen in Gaza, Iraq, the Central African \nRepublic and South Sudan, our world is far from \npeaceful. In the face of all those who have been killed \nin war, we must ask ourselves how we can keep the \ntragedies from recurring. In the face of women and \nchildren displaced by fighting, we must ask ourselves \nwhen they can return home. In the face of incessant \nconflicts, we must ask ourselves how we can open the \ndoor to lasting peace. To address those problems, China \nbelieves that we should do the following.\n\nFirst, we should seek political solutions. To beat \nswords into ploughshares may take time and effort, but \nhistory and reality have repeatedly demonstrated that \nto meet violence with violence will not lead to enduring \npeace, and the use of force will only create more \nproblems than solutions. Coercive action should be \nauthorized by the Security Council. If a country places \nits domestic law above international law and interferes \nin other countries\u2019 internal affairs at will, or even seeks \nregime change, the international community cannot but \nquestion the legitimacy of its actions.\n\nSecondly, we should accommodate the interests \nof all parties. Parties to a conflict should reject the \nzero-sum approach, address each other\u2019s concerns in \nnegotiations and endeavour to meet each other half \nway. They should seek to meet their legitimate concerns \nthrough consultations in a mutually accommodating \nway. When conducting mediation, the international \ncommunity should uphold justice and take an objective \nand balanced position. Countries should not be partial \nto any party in the conflict. Still less should they avail \nthemselves of the opportunity to pursue their own \nagenda.\n\nThirdly, we should promote national reconciliation. \nThe ongoing armed conflicts are largely caused by \nethnic and sectarian tensions. The process of national \nreconciliation and the process of political settlement \nshould be advanced in tandem with each other. All \nparties should uphold the Charter of the United \nNations, develop and practice a culture of inclusion and \ntolerance and uproot the seeds of hatred and retaliation, \nso that the fruit of inclusion and amity will grow on \npost-conflict land.\n\nFourthly, we should uphold multilateralism. We \nshould give full play to the role of the United Nations \nand observe international law and the basic norms \ngoverning international relations. Chapter VII of the \nCharter is not the only means for the Security Council \nto maintain international peace and security. We should \nmake better and full use of the means of prevention, \nmediation and conciliation stipulated in Chapter VI.\n\nGiven their familiarity with local developments, we \nshould leverage the strengths of regional organizations \nand countries and support them in addressing regional \nissues in ways suited to their regions.\n\nThe conflicts in Ukraine remain a cause of \nconcern. We welcome and support the Minsk ceasefire \nagreement and urge all parties in Ukraine to strictly \n\nimplement it and seek a comprehensive, sustained \nand balanced political solution through political \ndialogue and negotiation. China hopes that the various \nethnic groups in Ukraine will live in harmony and \nthat Ukraine will live in peace with other countries. \nThat is the fundamental way for Ukraine to achieve \nlong-term stability and security. China hopes that \nthe United Nations will play its due role in finding a \nproper solution to the Ukrainian crisis and supports the \ninternational community\u2019s constructive efforts to ease \nthe humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine.\n\nChina supports Iraq in upholding its sovereignty, \nindependence and territorial integrity. The formation of \nthe new Iraqi Government has provided an important \nopportunity. We hope that the Iraqi Government will \nlead its people in a joint endeavour to develop their \ncountry in the spirit of inclusion and reconciliation. \nChina calls for providing more humanitarian assistance \nto support Iraq. To help the Iraqi people overcome \ndifficulties and to achieve peace and stability in their \ncountry is the shared responsibility of the international \ncommunity.\n\nChina firmly opposes all terrorist acts and supports \nthe international community in responding to the \nthreat posed by terrorist forces in a coordinated and \nconcerted way in accordance with the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions. China believes that in conducting \ninternational counter-terrorism cooperation, we should \ntake a multipronged approach and address both the \nsymptoms and root causes of terrorism, and that the \nUnited Nations and the Security Council should fully \nplay leading roles. There should be no double standard \nwhen it comes to fighting terrorism; still less should \nterrorism be identified with any particular ethnic group \nor religion.\n\nAs new developments emerge in the global fight \nagainst terrorism, the international community should \ntake new measures to address them. In particular, it \nshould focus on combating religious extremism and \ncyberterrorism, resolutely eliminate the root causes of \nterrorism and extremism, block channels that spread \nthem and crack down hard and effectively on the use of \nthe Internet and other new means of communication by \nterrorists to instigate, recruit, finance or plot terrorist \nattacks.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has continued for nearly four \nyears. It is negotiation, not fighting, that offers \nsolutions. China urges all parties in Syria to end the \nfighting and violence immediately, cooperate fully with \nUnited Nations humanitarian assistance operations and \nhelp bring an end to the suffering of innocent civilians \nas soon as possible. We urge all the parties to act in the \noverall interests of the future and fate of their country \nand people, demonstrate the necessary political will, \nactively support the mediation efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and his Special Envoy, and follow a middle \nway that draws on workable practices from other \ncountries and regions, suits Syria\u2019s national conditions \nand accommodates the interests of various parties, in \norder to give peace a chance.\n\nThe Palestinian issue is an open wound on the \nconscience of humankind. China calls on Israel \nand Palestine to agree on a durable ceasefire, and it \nurges Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip and \nstop building settlements. At the same time, Israel\u2019s \nlegitimate security concerns should be respected. We \nhope that Israel and Palestine will choose the way of \npeace and resume and advance the peace talks as soon \nas possible. The aspirations and legitimate demands of \nthe Palestinian people for an independent nation must \nnot remain unmet indefinitely. Advancing peace in the \nMiddle East calls for the concerted efforts of many, not \nof one or two countries alone. The Security Council \nshould play its rightful role, and we support its efforts \nto take action in response to the demands of Palestine \nand the League of Arab States.\n\nNegotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue have \nentered a crucial stage. All the parties should display \ngood faith, continue their efforts in a spirit of mutual \nrespect, equality, collaboration and accommodation, \nand work hard on the most difficult issues, so that a \nwin-win agreement that is comprehensive, fair and \nbalanced is arrived at as soon as possible.\n\nThe two sides of the conflict in South Sudan \nshould establish a ceasefire immediately, organize an \nactive political dialogue that addresses the interests \nof the people in South Sudan in general and, through \nthe mediation of the Intergovernmental Authority \non Development, work with all the country\u2019s ethnic \ngroups and parties to speedily reach a fair and balanced \nsolution and achieve national reconciliation and ethnic \nunity. South Sudan is the youngest Member of the \nUnited Nations. The South Sudanese people deserve a \nlife of hope and vitality, not the devastation caused by \nconflicts and wars.\n\n\nChina welcomes the election of Mr. Ashraf Ghani \nas the new President of Afghanistan and Mr. Abdullah \nAbdullah as its Chief Executive, and will continue to \nsupport the Afghan people in their work to achieve a \nsmooth political, security and economic transition and \nto build jointly with them an Afghanistan that enjoys \nunity, stability, development and amity. We support \nan Afghan-led and -owned peace process, with the \ninternational community fulfilling its commitment and \nresponsibility to Afghanistan and its people. China will \nhost the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Istanbul \nProcess so that we can give Afghanistan fresh support \nas it stands on the threshold of a new era.\n\nOn the issue of the Korean peninsula, China calls \non all the parties to act objectively and impartially, \nremain committed to the goal of denuclearizing the \npeninsula, firmly uphold its peace and stability, and \nendeavour to resolve the issues through dialogue and \nconsultation. The Six-Party Talks remain the only \nviable and effective way to resolve the nuclear issue on \nthe Korean peninsula, and we now have the pressing \ntask of restarting the talks as soon as possible. The issue \nshould be tackled through a sustainable, irreversible \nand effective dialogue process that addresses all the \nparties\u2019 concerns in a comprehensive and balanced \nway. Since there are still many uncertainties on the \npeninsula today, all the parties concerned should \nexercise restraint, refrain from provocative acts, work \nharder to help ease tensions and jointly uphold peace \nand stability.\n\nWhile the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) established by the United Nations in 2000 \nhave contributed greatly to improving human survival \nand development, global development is still a task for \nthe long term. The international community is not only \ndealing with the formidable challenges of reducing \npoverty, eradicating hunger and improving education \nand the health of women and children, it is also facing \nnew challenges in the form of the environment, climate \nchange and energy and resource security.\n\nNext year is the deadline for meeting the MDGs, \nand the post-2015 development agenda will take \nover this historic mission. Building on past progress \nand also breaking new ground, the international \ncommunity should formulate more effective plans \nand take more robust action to advance humankind\u2019s \nshared development. As we see it, the development \nagenda should have three goals. First, it should advance \npeople\u2019s well-being, with a focus on eradicating \npoverty and encouraging development. Secondly, \nit should promote inclusiveness, in the interests of \nsupporting social equity and justice. Thirdly, it should \nensure the implementation of all these things. Based \non the principles of diversity in development models \nand shared but differentiated responsibilities, the \nagenda should aim to enhance global partnerships for \ndevelopment and improve implementation tools and \nmechanisms.\n\nClimate change is a challenge that all humankind \nis facing. Mr. Zhang Gaoli, Vice Premier of the State \nCouncil, led the Chinese delegation to this year\u2019s \nClimate Summit at the United Nations as a special \nenvoy of China\u2019s President. We congratulate the \nUnited Nations on the Summit\u2019s success and hope that \nthe political momentum it generated will translate \ninto effective actions for improving international \ncooperation on climate change. All parties should \nwork to conclude negotiations on a new post-2020 \nclimate-change regime as scheduled, by the end of \n2015, in accordance with the principles of shared but \ndifferentiated responsibilities, equity and respective \ncapabilities, with the aim of creating fairer and more \nequitable and effective arrangements for international \ncooperation on climate change.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic, which is raging in some \nAfrican countries, has once again sounded the alarm \non global health security. As a good brother and partner \nof Africa, with whom it shares the good and the bad, \nChina will continue to stand firmly with the African \npeople and to support and assist them to the best of its \nability. We will also take an active part in the relevant \ninternational assistance efforts. China calls on the \nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations and \nother international agencies to work closely with the \ninternational community, come up with new initiatives \nfor strengthening global health security and provide \nmore assistance to developing countries, particularly in \nAfrica.\n\nNext year is one of special historic significance, \nas it marks the seventieth anniversary of victory in \nthe anti-fascist world war, the founding of the United \nNations and victory in the Chinese people\u2019s war against \nJapanese aggression. Remembering the past makes us \ncherish peace, and recalling history will help to guide \nus as we embrace the future. China welcomes the \ninclusion of the seventieth anniversary of the end of the \nSecond World War on the agenda of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly as an important opportunity.\n\nWhen we look back on what happened 70 years \nago, the historical facts are clear, and a final verdict \nhas been pronounced on what was right and what was \nwrong. History should not be falsified or truth distorted. \nToday, 70 years later, let us jointly uphold human \njustice and conscience so that those who attempt to \ndeny aggression and distort history will have nowhere \nto hide. Let us jointly defend the Charter of the United \nNations and the outcomes of the Second World War, \nso that that vision of a world free of war, with lasting \npeace, will take deep root in our hearts and pass from \none generation to the next.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe President of the Republic, Mr. Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz, and \non my own behalf, and in the name of the State and \npeople of Guinea-Bissau, I would like to congratulate \nMr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His \nelection by this most representative institution of the \ninternational system is a tribute not only to his country, \nUganda, but to the entire African continent. I welcome \nhim and wish him success in guiding the work of the \nAssembly.\n\nWe are grateful to the United Nations, and to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon in particular, for \nthe attention given to Guinea-Bissau and for the \nimportant contribution of the Special Representative of \nthe Secretary-General in our country to our political \nnormalization process. We would also like to say a \nspecial word of appreciation to the former Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, President \nRamos-Horta, for his friendship with Guinea-Bissau \nand his dedication to his mission.\n\n\nWe express our appreciation to and thank the \nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, its Government \nand people. When they saw the need of their sister \nnation of Guinea-Bissau, they extended the hand of \nfriendship and provided valuable and extraordinary \nsupport to our country in dealing with our crisis, for \nwhich the entire nation of Guinea-Bissau is grateful.\n\nThe subregion contributed financial support \nin helping our Government to function, which has \nbeen key in enabling us to reach the point where we \nfind ourselves today. We would like to express our \nappreciation and acknowledgement to the forces of \nthe Economic Community of West African States \nMission (ECOWAS) in Guinea-Bissau, who carried \nout their mission with professionalism and ensured a \npeaceful and orderly transition. Similarly, we commend \nthe efforts of all our national political actors and \ninternational partners to reach the consensus required \nto maintain an international stabilization force after the \nend of the Mission\u2019s mandate.\n\nWe would like to acknowledge and thank all the \nmember countries of ECOWAS for their support, in \nparticular my friend and brother President Goodluck \nJonathan of Nigeria, who chaired the Contact Group \non Guinea-Bissau and provided additional and valuable \nsupport to our country. I pray for peace and tranquillity \nfor his country and for the welfare of his people. We are \nalso deeply grateful to President Alpha Cond\u00e9 of Guinea, \nwho mediated the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Finally, we \nwould like to express our profound acknowledgement \nand gratitude to all our international partners \u2014 the \nUnited Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, the \nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries and its \nmember States, the European Union, the West African \nEconomic and Monetary Union and the International \nOrganization of la Francophonie, whose support was \nimportant in monitoring and managing the political \ntransition process, as well as in holding free, transparent \nand fair general elections in our country.\n\nI would also like to share with the Assembly \nthat Guinea-Bissau\u2019s society has renewed its hope in \na new political cycle and to assure it that we possess \nthe political will and deep commitment needed to \nconsolidate political stability, revitalize and strengthen \nthe State\u2019s capacity and create the basic conditions that \nwill enable our people to realize their dreams.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a post-conflict State with fragile \ninstitutions and scarce financial resources, suffering \nfrom the severe political, economic, environmental and \nsocial consequences of our crisis. We therefore face a \ncomplex and difficult situation, in which we call on the \ninternational community for assistance, that will be \nessential if we are to stabilize our country in this post-\nelection period and achieve our goals of strengthening \nthe State\u2019s institutional capacity, reducing our people\u2019s \npoverty and vulnerabilities, ensuring social stability, \nlegitimizing the Government, and relaunching our \neconomy. That approach to international assistance, \nat the centre of our dialogue with our international \npartners, is based on the Government\u2019s agenda, which \nincludes three key programmes: Urgent, Contingency \nand Medium-Term Development.\n\nUnder the Urgent Programme, we must ensure \nfood safety and social stability through support for \nagricultural production and distribution, improve access \nto food and income for some sectors of the population, \nprovide the population with basic health, education and \nwater and power supply services, and pay civil servants\u2019 \noverdue salaries. It also includes an emergency health \naction plan for preventing and responding to the threat \nof an Ebola epidemic. The Contingency Programme\u2019s \nobjective is essentially to ensure the transparency \nand accountability of all natural-resource concession \nand exploitation agreements and to end the nefarious \nprocedures that allowed our country\u2019s forestry and \nfishery resources to be plundered over the past two \nyears. The Medium-Term Development Programme \nwill be presented to our international partners at a \ndonor conference to be held at the end of this year or \nearly next, and for which we are requesting the essential \nsupport of the United Nations and all our multilateral \nand bilateral partners.\n\nAs we embark on the challenge of rebuilding \nGuinea-Bissau anew, we are fully conscious of the \nproblems but filled with a patriotic spirit of collective \ndrive and unity joining all Bissau-Guineans and, in \nparticular, all political actors and sovereign institutions, \nwith full confidence in an inclusive Government that \nincorporates all political parties represented in our \nParliament, as well as civil society and the diaspora. \nThis confidence was significantly enhanced by our \nnational Parliament\u2019s recent unanimous approval of the \nGovernment\u2019s programme, which is unprecedented in \nthe history of our democracy.\n\nWhile it is true that the ongoing process of political \nstabilization and normalization of the democratic \ninstitutions in Guinea-Bissau depends on a major \n\nnational effort, it will also require unequivocal and \nurgent support from our regional and international \npartners. We must structure and coordinate our actions \nbased on the goals established in the Government\u2019s \nprogramme in order to lay the foundations for our \ncountry to change course and become viable.\n\nIn this context, three situations demonstrate how \nimperative it is for us to combine our efforts. The first \nis the ongoing process of defence and security sector \nreform, including extensive steps taken in recent days \ntowards its reorganization. We need international \nsupport in order to make those steps sustainable and \nirreversible. The second is the extension of the State\u2019s \npresence throughout the national territory in an effective \nand organized manner through decentralization and \nlocal elections. The Government will lay the foundations \nfor the municipal administrations to become operational \nand will adopt the national territory organization policy. \nThe third is the extremely complex task of combating \ndrug trafficking and organized crime. Our country\u2019s \nefforts will be successful only through a collective and \nobjective approach.\n\nGuinea-Bissau needs a robust and impactful \nintervention from our development partners in order \nnot only to consolidate the success of our political \ntransition but also to lay the foundations for a transition \nto development. We request the reactivation of the \nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau under \nthe auspices of the United Nations, for the purpose of \nmonitoring the domestic situation in our country and \nsupporting the mobilization of international aid, which \nis key for us to face the challenges in our future.\n\nThe new authorities in Guinea-Bissau, our \nParliament, the President of the Republic and our \nGovernment chose an inclusive dialogue and political \ncoordination as the preferred tools in our efforts \nto consolidate political stability and create broad \nconsensus around the main thrusts of governance. \nTherefore, in addition to strengthening the democratic \nlegitimacy of our political institutions, we wish to \ntake clear, unequivocal and decisive steps to build \nbroad consensus on the main issues facing our society. \nThey would be anchored in a political protocol that \nestablishes the main areas of legislative and executive \naction, including issues related to reforming the State, \nrevising the Constitution and rebuilding the economy. \nA sign of this power-sharing vision for the resolution \nof our main problems is the inclusion of the opposition \nleader in our delegation to the United Nations, in order \nto show the world that Guinea-Bissau has embarked on \na path of harmony and stability.\n\nOur subregion, West Africa, is facing an Ebola \nepidemic, which directly threatens several members \nof ECOWAS, to which we belong. Allow me to offer \nGuinea-Bissau\u2019s solidarity to our sister nations where \ncases of contamination have been identified. I would \nlike to note our appreciation for the international efforts \nin providing urgent medical assistance and to call on \nthe international community to step up its commitment \nand support in combating and preventing this epidemic. \nWe also appeal for the establishment of an effective \ninternational coalition to confront this grave threat to \ninternational security, which was recently recognized \nas such by the Security Council.\n\nI reaffirm my country\u2019s position on reforming the \nSecurity Council. The enlargement of this important \nUnited Nations body is required in order to enhance the \nlegitimacy of its representation and to reflect the new \ninternational order under discussion. Therefore, and in \naccordance with the African Union\u2019s position, Guinea-\nBissau calls for the designation of two permanent seats \nwith the right of veto and five non-permanent seats in \nthe Security Council for the African continent. We also \nvoice our support for the designation of permanent seats \non the Security Council for Brazil, Japan, Germany and \nIndia.\n\nI would like to assure the peoples and countries \nthat have fallen victim to international terrorism of our \nsolidarity and to renew our Government\u2019s commitment \nto combating this scourge within a framework of \ncoordinated actions undertaken jointly with our \nregional and international partners, according to the \nspecific nature of the actions.\n\nWe note with concern that the economic and \nfinancial embargo imposed against Cuba more than \n50 years ago constitutes a serious obstacle to that \ncountry\u2019s economic and social development, and we \nreiterate our call for it to be lifted.\n\nWe commend and encourage the United Nations, \nand in particular the Secretary-General, for their \nrenewed efforts, vision and wisdom with regard to the \nissue of climate change and its effects on life on our \nplanet. The Climate Summit held here on 23 September \nwas an eloquent testament to this fact. The main areas \nthat may allow for viable and sustainable development \nemerged and seem likely to gather the required \nconsensus for the establishment of a post-Kyoto global \n\nclimate regime designed to promote the well-being of \nall.\n\nSustainable development goals, the new post-\n2015 global development paradigm, must be rooted in \nthe peoples\u2019 cultures and objective realities and must \nundoubtedly draw their inspiration from the lessons of \nthe Millennium Development Goals.\n\nIt should be noted that climate change is no longer \nsimply a future threat; it has now become an unequivocal \nthreat to the present. The rising incidence of climate \nchange that exposes our vulnerabilities is now felt and \nhas increasingly unpredictable consequences. Human, \neconomic and environmental losses in a vulnerable \ncountry such as Guinea-Bissau are increasing and \nthreaten our survival and development prospects.\n\nSea-level rise may irreversibly affect coastal areas, \nincluding entire islands, villages, cities and other seaside \nsettlements. This situation is particularly worrisome \nfor our country, which, with its combination of coasts \nand archipelagos, is highly vulnerable to the impacts \nof climate events and may see its efforts to combat \npoverty and achieve development goals compromised.\n\nDespite all the difficulties that have challenged \nGuinea-Bissau\u2019s efforts to fulfil our international \ncommitments holistically, we are pleased to note that \n12 per cent of our national territory consists of protected \nareas, which should double by 2020. Unfortunately, \nmost of the population in developing countries with \nforests, such as Guinea-Bissau, continues to depend on \nthese natural resources as their only means of survival. \nTherefore, in order to offset the possible loss of those \nresources, technological and financial alternatives must \nbe made available to this population.\n\nI conclude my statement by thanking the United \nNations and expressing our deep appreciation for the \nsignificant role that the Peacebuilding Commission has \nplayed in supporting the consolidation of political and \ngovernance stability in Guinea-Bissau. I also recognize \nthe United Nations bodies, including the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, UNICEF, the World Food \nProgramme, the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations, the United Nations Population \nFund and the World Health Organization, as well as the \ngrass-roots groups and non-governmental organizations \nworking on a day-to-day basis with our Government \nin combating poverty and the vulnerabilities of our \npopulation and advocating respect for human dignity.\n\nThe people of Guinea-Bissau look forward to the \nactive engagement of those bodies in assisting in the \nnew phase of our accelerated efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. Guinea-Bissau is \npoised to transform its territory into an area of peace, \nsecurity, and openness for all of those who, together \nwith our people, wish to build a more brotherly, secure, \nwelcoming and progress-oriented society with all \npeoples and cultures.\n"

        "file_text": "This year we \nface extraordinary tests of our values and our resolve. \nIn responding to the aggression against one of our \nMember States, Ukraine; in seeking peace in the Middle \nEast; in dealing with the terrifying spread of the Ebola \nvirus in West Africa; and in overcoming what I want to \nfocus on today, which is the mortal threat we all face \n\nfrom the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL) in Syria and Iraq. Deir ez-Zor is a province in \neastern Syria. Home to the Al-Sheitaat tribe it was \ncaptured by ISIL last month. Seven hundred tribesmen \nwere executed; many were beheaded. The vast majority \nwere civilians, Muslims who refused to take an oath of \nallegiance to ISIL\u2019s sick extremist world view and who \npaid for this with their lives. They are not alone. Across \nSyria and northern Iraq thousands have suffered the \nsame fate \u2014 Muslims, both Sunni and Shia; Christians; \nYazidis; people of every faith and none.\n\nISIL is not a problem restricted to just one region. It \nhas murderous plans to expand its borders well beyond \nIraq and Syria and to carry out terrorist atrocities right \nacross the world. It is recruiting new fighters from all \nover the world. Five hundred have gone there from \nmy country, Britain, and one of them almost certainly \nbrutally murdered two American journalists and a \nBritish aid worker. This is a problem that affects us all \nand we must tackle it together.\n\nThere is not one person in this Hall who will view \nthis challenge without reference to the past, whether in \nIraq or in Afghanistan. Of course it is absolutely right \nthat we should learn the lessons of the past, especially \nwhat happened in Iraq a decade ago. But we have to \nlearn the right lessons \u2014 yes to careful preparation; \nno to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan. \nBut we must not be so frozen with fear that we do not \ndo anything at all. Isolation and withdrawing from a \nproblem like ISIL will only make matters worse.\n\nWe must not allow past mistakes to become an \nexcuse for indifference or inaction. The right lesson is \nthat we should act, but act differently. We should be \ncomprehensive, defeating the ideology of extremism \nthat is the root cause of this terrorism, so that we win the \nbattle of ideas and not just the battle of military might. \nWe should be intelligent, supporting representative and \naccountable Governments and working with them at \ntheir request, not going in over their heads. We should \nbe inclusive, working with partners in the region who \nare prepared to be part of the solution, potentially \nincluding Iran. We should be uncompromising, using \nall the means at our disposal, including military force, \nto hunt down these extremists. Let me take each of \nthese in turn.\n\nThe root cause of this terrorist threat is a poisonous \nideology of Islamist extremism. This has nothing \nto do with Islam, which is a peaceful religion that \ninspires countless acts of generosity every day. Islamist \nextremism on the other hand believes in using the most \nbrutal forms of terrorism to force people to accept a \nwarped world view and to live in a quasi-mediaeval \nstate. To defeat ISIL, and organizations like it, we must \ndefeat this ideology in all its forms.\n\nAs evidence emerges about the backgrounds of \nthose convicted of terrorist offences, it is clear that \nmany of them were initially influenced by preachers \nwho claim not to encourage violence but whose world \nview can be used as a justification for it. We know \nthis world view. The peddling of lies \u2014 that 9/11 was \nsomehow a Jewish plot, or that the 7/7 London attacks \nwere staged; the idea that Muslims are persecuted all \nover the world as a deliberate act of Western policy; and \nthe concept of an inevitable clash of civilizations.\n\nWe must be clear. To defeat the ideology of \nextremism we need to deal with all forms of extremism, \nnot just violent extremism. For governments there \nare some obvious ways we can do this. We must ban \npreachers of hate from coming to our countries. We must \nproscribe organizations that incite terrorism against \npeople at home and abroad. We must work together \nto take down illegal online material like the recent \nvideos of ISIL murdering hostages. We must stop the \nso-called non-violent extremists from inciting hatred \nand intolerance in our schools, universities and even \nour prisons. Of course, some will argue that this is not \ncompatible with free speech and intellectual inquiry. \nBut I ask \u201cWould we sit back and allow right-wing \nextremists, Nazis or Ku Klux Klansmen to recruit on \nour university campuses?\u201d No, so we should not stand \nby and just allow any form of non-violent extremism.\n\nWe need to argue that prophecies of a global war \nof religion pitting Muslims against the rest of the world \nare nonsense. We need Muslims and their Governments \nthroughout the world to reclaim their religion from \nthese sick terrorists as so many are doing, and quite \nrightly doing, today. We all need to help them with \nprogrammes that channel young people away from \nthese poisonous ideologues, and we need the strongest \npossible international focus on tackling this ideology, \nwhich is why here at the United Nations the United \nKingdom is calling for a new Special Representative \non extremism.\n\nBut fighting extremism will never be enough. \nCommunism was defeated not simply by pointing out its \nflaws, but by showing that the alternative of economic \nfreedoms, democracy and the rule of law could build a \nbetter society and a better world. Young people need \n\n\nto see the power of a different, better, more open, \nmore democratic path. The twentieth century taught \nus the vital role of representative and accountable \nGovernments in offering their people opportunity, hope \nand dignity.\n\nOf course we should not be na\u00efve. Not every \ncountry can move at the same speed or even reach the \nsame destination. We should respect different cultures, \ntraditions and histories. But let us be clear \u2014 the failure \nto meet people\u2019s aspirations can create a breeding \nground where extremist and even terrorist insurgency \ncan take root. Governments that only govern for some \nof their people cause deep resentment. In Iraq, the \nfailure of the Al-Maliki Government to represent all of \nthe people has driven some of them into the arms of the \nextremists.\n\nToo often, people have been faced with a false choice \nbetween an autocratic and unrepresentative government \non the one hand and a brutal insurgency, with religion \nmisused as its rallying call, on the other. To combat this \nwe must support the building blocks of free and open \nsocieties. In Iraq this means supporting the creation of \na new and genuinely inclusive Government capable of \nuniting all Iraqis \u2014 Sunnis, Shia, Kurd, Christians and \nothers. In Syria, it must mean a political transition and \nan end to Al-Assad\u2019s brutality.\n\nI know there are some who think that we should \ndo a deal with Al-Assad in order to defeat ISIL. But I \nthink this view is dangerously misguided. Our enemies\u2019 \nenemy is not our friend; it is another enemy. Doing a \ndeal with Al-Assad will not defeat ISIL because the \nbias and the brutality of the Al-Assad regime were and \nare one of the most powerful recruiting tools for the \nextremists. Syria needs what Iraq needs \u2014 an inclusive, \nrepresentative, democratic Government that can look \nafter the interests of all its peoples.\n\nTo those who have backed Al-Assad or who have \nstood on the sidelines, I would say this: \u201cWe are ready \nto join with you in a new political effort to secure \na representative and accountable Government in \nDamascus that can take the fight to ISIL\u201d. It is simply \nnot credible for Al-Assad to lead such a government \nalthough we are prepared to look at every practical \noption to find a way forward.\n\nWe must be inclusive, engaging the widest possible \ncoalition of countries in this international effort. ISIL is \na threat to us all, but the greatest threat is to the region. \nIt is very welcome that a number of Arab countries \nhave already taken part in the action to degrade ISIL. \nThey have shown courage and leadership. Iran should \nalso be given the chance to show it can be part of the \nsolution, not part of the problem. Earlier today I met \nwith President Rouhani. We have severe disagreements. \nIran\u2019s support for terrorist organizations, its nuclear \nprogramme, and its treatment of its people all need to \nchange. But Iran\u2019s leaders could help in defeating the \nthreat from ISIL. They could help to secure a more \nstable, inclusive Iraq, and a more stable and inclusive \nSyria. If they are prepared to do this, we should \nwelcome their engagement.\n\nFinally, when the safety and security of our \npeople are at stake, we must be uncompromising in \nour response. That starts at home. For our part, in \nthe United Kingdom we are introducing new powers \nto strengthen our ability to seize passports and stop \nsuspects from travelling; to allow us to strip British \nidentity from dual nationals and temporarily prevent \nsome British nationals getting back into our country; \nto ensure that airlines comply with our no fly lists \nand security screening requirements; and to enable \nour police and security services to apply for stronger \nlocational constraints on those in the United Kingdom \nwho pose a risk. Here at the United Nations we have \nled in the adoption of a Security Council resolution to \ndisrupt the flows of finance to ISIL, to sanction those \nwho are seeking to recruit to ISIL and to encourage \ncountries to do all they can to prevent foreign fighters \njoining the extremist cause.\n\nWhat about the role of our military? I do not believe \nthat the treat of Islamist extremism will best be solved \nby Western ground troops directly trying to pacify or \nreconstruct Middle Eastern or African countries. But, \npursuing an intelligent and comprehensive approach \nshould include a place for our military. Our military \ncan support the enormous humanitarian efforts that \nare necessary, as our Royal Air Force did in helping \nthe millions of people who fled from ISIL. We should, \ntogether, do more to build the capability of the legitimate \nauthorities that are fighting the extremists. That can \nmean training, equipping and advising, and providing \ntechnology and the other assets necessary for success. \nWhether it is supporting action against Boko Haram in \nNigeria, against Al-Shabaab in Somalia, against Ansar \nal-Sharia in Libya, or against Al-Qaida in Yemen, it is \nright to help those who are fighting on the front line for \ntheir societies, their countries and their freedom.\n\n\nAlong with our European partners, we have already \nbeen supplying equipment directly to Kurdish forces. \nWe are strengthening the resilience of the military \nforces in neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan, and \nBritish Tornado and surveillance aircraft have already \nbeen helping with intelligence gathering and logistics \nsupport to help those taking on ISIL in Iraq.\n\nWe now have a substantial international coalition in \nplace, including Arab nations, committed to confronting \nand defeating ISIL. We have a comprehensive strategy \nto do that, with the political, diplomatic, humanitarian \nand military components that are needed to succeed \nover time. The Security Council has now received a \nclear request from the Iraqi Government to support it \nin its military action against ISIL. So we have a clear \nbasis in international law for action, and we have a need \nto act in our own national interest to protect our people \nand our society. It is right that Britain should now move \nto a new phase of action. I am therefore recalling the \nBritish Parliament on Friday to secure approval for the \nUnited Kingdom to take part in international air strikes \nagainst ISIL in Iraq.\n\nMy message today is simple. We are facing an evil \nagainst which the whole world should unite. As ever, in \nthe cause of freedom, democracy and justice, Britain \nwill play its part.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate Mr. Sam \nKutesa of Uganda on his assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \nalso extend my warmest gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for \nhis work as President of the sixty-eighth session.\n\nOver the past few months, Bulgaria and the Balkans \nhave suffered unprecedented floods. Thousands of \npeople lost their homes, crops were ruined and many \ninnocent people died. The heavy storms were no \nlonger news but a part of daily life. Nature once again \nreminded us that today, political statements alone were \nnot sufficient. For the sake of our children and our \nplanet, it is time to act. As a wise man once said, we did \nnot inherit the Earth from our fathers; we borrowed it \nfrom our children. Climate change needs to be urgently \naddressed. I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for having organized the Climate Summit. \nBulgaria will actively support the completion of the \nnegotiations on the new, universal and legally binding \nclimate agreement in 2015.\n\nBulgaria contributed to the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals and the development \nof the post-2015 development agenda through its \nsuccessful participation in the Open Working Group \non Sustainable Development Goals. The Group has \nfulfilled its mandate. The Group\u2019s report, together \nwith the report of High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \non the Post-2015 Development Agenda (A/67/890, \nannex), will be the leading documents for our future \ndiscussions as we enter the critical phase of the debate \non the post-2015 development agenda. It is crucial \nthat all sides stay engaged and committed to the final \ngoal \u2014 an ambitious and forward-looking framework. \nNo real transformative post-2015 development agenda \nwill be possible unless we address the loopholes of the \ncurrent Millennium Development Goals and build upon \nthe lessons learned. The new framework should be \nfounded on the principles of respect for human rights, \ninclusiveness, good governance and the rule of law. \nYouth-specific targets in the areas of education, health \ncare and employment are of paramount importance as \nwell.\n\nDevelopment is unthinkable without peace and \nsecurity. The illegal annexation of Crimea by the \nRussian Federation and the conflict in eastern Ukraine \nhave become one of the most serious threats to peace \nand security in Europe since the Second World War. The \nsecurity environment in the Black Sea region has been \nseriously affected. The illegal annexation of Crimea \nundermines the international order. After the Second \nWorld War, we built our world on the clear principles \nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations. They \nwere shattered to pieces in a matter of weeks. Bulgaria \nstrongly supports the sovereignty, unity and territorial \nintegrity of Ukraine. My country does not recognize \nthe illegal referendum in Crimea and condemns the \n\nannexation by Russia as a violation of international law. \nBulgaria joined the numerous sponsors of resolution \n68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nMy country welcomes the ceasefire agreement and \nis looking forward to the implementation of the peace \nplan. Bulgaria commends all international efforts for \nthe peaceful resolution of the conflict. We welcome the \nstrong engagement of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nand the initiatives of the European Union and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nas well as the efforts of the trilateral contact group. \nRussia should stop arming and supporting separatists \nin Ukraine.\n\nIn a few days, Ukrainians will vote for a new \nparliament. They have every right to choose their \nown future. I sincerely hope that those elections will \nbe a major step forward in building a democratic and \nprosperous Ukraine. The signing and ratification of the \nEuropean Union Association Agreements of Ukraine, \nMoldova and Georgia represent an important milestone \nin the process of the European integration of those \ncountries. The positive change witnessed today in \nthe Balkans would not have been possible without the \nengine of the European integration.\n\nThe escalation of violence and the humanitarian \nsituation in Syria continue to be a source of grave \nconcern. Millions of refugees have fled their homeland \nin pursuit of peace in the neighbouring countries. \nHundreds of thousands have lost their lives. More than \n10,000 refugees have sought asylum in Bulgaria. A \nlasting solution to the conflict in Syria can be achieved \nonly through an inclusive political process. We call on \nthe Security Council to unite. The unity of the Security \nCouncil is crucial in order for the conflict to be resolved.\n\nThe Syrian crisis, along with the outbreak of \nviolence and sectarian tensions in Iraq, has exacerbated \nthe security and humanitarian situation in the entire \nMiddle East region. Bulgaria strongly condemns the \narmed attacks and killings perpetrated by the Islamic \nState terrorist organization against religious and ethnic \nminorities and denounces the brutal execution of \ninnocent people. Bulgaria is an integral part of the broad \ninternational coalition against terrorism. A member of \nthe European Union and of NATO, my country lends its \npolitical support, as well as humanitarian and material \naid, within the scope of its possibilities. We welcome \nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) \non foreign terrorist fighters.\n\nCombating radicalization, supporting State-building \nin Iraq and cooperating with regional partners are \nessential. We welcome the election of Mr. Haider Al \nAbadi as Prime Minister of Iraq. We hope that, under \nhis leadership, a Government of broad representation \nwill be established in order to preserve the territorial \nintegrity and sovereignty of the country.\n\nBulgaria greatly values the role of the United Nations \nin Iraq and appreciates the contribution of Mr. Nickolay \nMladenov, former Bulgarian Foreign Minister, Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General and Head \nof the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. \nWe stand for a just and lasting settlement of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two-State \nsolution formula. That is possible only through direct \nnegotiations with no preconditions and in conformity \nwith the relevant international obligations. Any durable \nceasefire should address both Israeli security concerns \nand Palestinian demands to abolish the Gaza closure \nregime.\n\nThe adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty was a major \nachievement of the international community. Just over a \nyear later, the threshold of 50 ratifications was reached \nthis morning. I am glad that my country is among \nthose 50 States that have made the entry into force of \nthat important legal instrument a reality. The Arms \nTrade Treaty fills a serious gap in international law. \nIt establishes regulations for the trade in conventional \narms at the global level. Now its implementation and \nuniversalization are of the utmost importance.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the Berlin Wall fell and the \ndemocratic transitions in Central and Eastern Europe \nbegan. My country Bulgaria chose to become a modern \nEuropean democracy. We put our country back on the \npath of freedom, independence, the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights. Our society has proved its \nfirm commitment to democratic values and principles. \nWe have witnessed similar political changes across \nSouth-East Europe. The Balkan countries have become \npartners, sharing the same values and projects for the \nfuture. We have built bridges of trust, friendship and \nmutual respect. We are working together to improve \nlinks and competition in order to increase prosperity \nin the Balkans.\n\nHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law \nare at the heart of my country\u2019s foreign policy. \nBulgaria\u2019s commitment to advancing the human rights \nagenda throughout the United Nations system was \nfurther strengthened under the successful Bulgarian \n\n\nchairmanship of the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural \nCommittee during the sixty-eighth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Bulgaria is determined to further \ncontribute to promoting and upholding human rights \ninternationally as a member of the Human Rights \nCouncil for the period 2019-2021, and will rely on its \npartners\u2019 valuable support of its candidature.\n\nMy country welcomes the appointment of \nPrince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Zeid Al-Husein of Jordan as the \nnew United Nations High Commissioner for Human \nRights \u2014 an excellent choice by the Secretary-General. \nWe wish Prince Zeid all success in fulfilling his \nmandate.\n\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s Rights Up \nFront Action Plan to safeguard human rights around \nthe world. Bulgaria commends Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral Jan Eliasson for his insightful vision and \nglobal leadership with regard to that initiative and his \nvaluable contribution to advancing the human rights \nagenda throughout the United Nations.\n\nBulgaria is concerned about the anti-Semitic attacks \nthat have taken place recently, especially in Europe. \nAs a country that saved 48,000 Bulgarian Jews from \ndeportation during the Second World War, Bulgaria \nstrongly condemns the recurring trend of brutal and \ndisgusting manifestations of anti-Semitism.\n\nThis year, the international community is \ncelebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption \nof the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which \nset a universal standard for the effective promotion of \nchildren\u2019s rights. Bulgaria commends UNICEF for its \nenormous contribution during that time to improving \nchildren\u2019s lives and advancing the child agenda around \nthe world. As a member of the Bureau of the UNICEF \nExecutive Board this year, my country supports \nand actively participates in all efforts aimed at child \nprotection and achieving results for children.\n\nMy country is convinced that the United Nations \nreform process should continue in order to enhance \nthe efficiency, representativeness and transparency of \nthe entire system, and to make it more adequate and \nresponsive to the new realities. As a member of the \nEastern European regional group, Bulgaria reiterates its \nposition in favour of allocating at least one additional \nnon-permanent seat to the Group in an enlarged Security \nCouncil. Bulgaria aspires to serve as a non-permanent \nmember of the Security Council for the 2018-2019 term.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the second term of office of \nthe current and highly respected Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, will come to an end. My country \ngreatly values his outstanding leadership and \ncommitment. Bulgaria expects that, when the time \ncomes, the States Members of the United Nations will \nbe able to elect a worthy successor. To that end I would \nlike to recall the relevant General Assembly resolution, \nwhich states that,\n\n\u201c[i]n the course of the identification and \nappointment of the best candidate for the post of \nSecretary-General, due regard shall continue to be \ngiven to regional rotation and shall also be given \nto gender equality\u201d (resolution 51/241, annex, para. \n59).\nBulgaria is convinced that the time has finally come \nfor the East European regional group to be represented \nat the helm of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed a distinct \nprivilege to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam \nKutesa on behalf of the Government and the people of \nBarbados on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. It is appropriate \nthat I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. John Ashe, for the aplomb with which he guided \nthe deliberations of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Assembly \u2014 \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d \u2014 is both timely and critical. \nFourteen years ago, world leaders placed the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, a set of time-bound and measurable \ngoals and targets, at the heart of the global development \nagenda. Today, we stand on the cusp of the unveiling of \na future global agenda for development. This must be an \nambitious, long-term project to improve people\u2019s lives \nand protect the planet for future generations. The 17 \ngoals and targets proposed by the Open Working Group \non Sustainable Development Goals must form the \nbasis for the elaboration of the post-2015 development \nagenda. This is especially so if we are to create a truly \ntransformative global programme anchored in the three \ndimensions of sustainable development, with poverty \neradication as its central objective and overarching \ngoal.\n\nThe special vulnerabilities faced by small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) and which serve to constrain \nour development are well known. As such, the \ninternational community recognized SIDS as a special \ncase in sustainable development in Agenda 21 \u2014 a \nrecognition that is echoed in the Barbados Programme of \nAction; the Mauritius Strategy, the outcome document \n(resolution 66/288, annex) of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20); \nand, most recently, the Small Island Developing States \nAccelerated Modalities of Action (Samoa Pathway).\n\nDespite that recognition, the Rio+20 outcome \ndocument indicated that SIDS have made less progress \nthan most other groupings, or even regressed, in \neconomic terms, especially in terms of poverty \nreduction and debt sustainability. This finding was \nrepeated in the Samoa Pathway. The International \nMonetary Fund has also acknowledged that, in the past \n10 years, SIDS have slid down the ladder of progress.\n\nIn design, delivery and implementation, therefore, \nthe post-2015 development agenda must as a priority \naddress the unique and particular vulnerabilities and \nchallenges of small island developing States. It must \nfoster the resilience of SIDS as a key objective of \nglobal efforts. A development agenda that ignores the \nintegration of SIDS-specific issues would be incomplete \nand of questionable validity.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda must also make \nprovisions for countries like Barbados, which is both \na small island developing State and a highly indebted \nmiddle-income country. We continue to suffer the \ndevastating impact of the global economic and financial \ncrisis and have limited scope, capacity, fiscal flexibility \nor policy space to respond effectively to them. We face \ndeclining export demand and decreased investment \nand demand for services upon which our economy is \ndependent, including tourism. Fiscal and financial \nstresses have forced us to make significant adjustments \nto our expenditure programmes. Against that backdrop, \nwe face the daunting challenge of continuing to provide \nadequate social safety nets for the most vulnerable of \nour citizens in a responsible and sustainable manner.\n\nDebt servicing and debt unsustainability far too \neasily undermine the advances that we desire to make \ntowards our sustainable development. Too often, the \nplight of middle-income countries is overlooked on \nthe presumption that by virtue of our gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita we do not require international \nassistance. Barbados emphatically restates that GDP per \ncapita cannot be the sole defining criterion for access \nto concessionary financing. The social, economic and \nenvironmental vulnerability of countries such as ours \nmust be taken into account.\n\nBarbados is therefore pleased to see that the \nUnited Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human \nDevelopment Report 2014, entitled \u201cSustaining Human \nProgress: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building \nResilience\u201d, incorporates the concept of vulnerability \nand places emphasis on strengthening the resilience \nof people, communities and countries. It is our hope \nthat those factors will give a more accurate picture of \nthe challenges that developing countries face. On that \nissue, the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mr. Freundel \nStuart, stated in his address at the Third International \nConference on Small Island Developing States, held in \nSamoa in September, that\n\n\u201cthe time has come for new approaches to be \ndesigned to assist middle-income countries which \nhave been graduated from access to concessional \nresources\u201d.\n\nI echo that call today. I implore the international \ncommunity to address the needs of middle-income \ncountries in the elaboration of a post-2015 development \nagenda. Accordingly, Barbados welcomes the third \nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \nto be held in Addis Ababa in July next year. The outcome \nof the Conference must make provisions for the special \nneeds of SIDS and middle-income countries.\n\nBarbados is fully cognizant of the responsibility \nthat developing countries themselves bear towards \nachieving their development goals. However, the reality \nis that, in seeking to meet those goals, the developing \ncountries are forced to do so on an uneven playing \nfield. The global financial and economic system and \nthe governance process that accompanies it continue to \noperate in an exclusionary manner. Barbados reiterates \nits call for a more transparent architecture that is \nsupportive of development objectives.\n\nBarbados has developed and implemented a cross-\nsectoral Green Economy Initiative, which is predicated \non the fragility of our small island ecosystems. The \nInitiative prioritizes natural resource protection \nintervention, business and investment choice, human \ndevelopment programming and the facilitation of export \nmarket development strategies. Barbados continues \nto partner with the United Nations Environment \nProgramme and, more recently, the United Nations \nIndustrial Development Organization to promote a \ntransition to a resource-efficient green economy. We \nhave taken action to enact a series of incentives in \nsupport of renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nOur efforts to transition to a green economy will \nbe undone if the international community does not take \nimmediate and urgent action to address climate change. \nThe most recent findings of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change underscore, yet again, the \nvulnerability of SIDS, particularly to the effects of \nclimate change, sea-level rise, ocean acidification and \nextreme weather events. Together, they represent an \nexistential threat to SIDS. We therefore urge major \ncarbon emitters to take all necessary actions.\n\nBarbados welcomed the holding of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Climate Summit 2014 at United Nations \nHeadquarters on 23 September. We hope that the \nmomentum from the Summit will inject urgency into \nthe proceedings of the upcoming twentieth session of \nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (COP 20), \nto be held in Lima in December. We also hope that, \nbeyond COP 20, it will ultimately galvanize political \nwill to conclude the negotiation of an ambitious, legally \nbinding international climate agreement in Paris in \n2015.\n\nIf SIDS are to have an impact internationally, \nparticularly at this crucial moment during the design \nand construction of a new global architecture for \nsustainable development, we must ensure that our \nvoices are heard. We must be guided by the concept of \na SIDS collectivity that recognizes strength in unity. \nWe SIDS must speak with one voice at the international \nlevel.\n\nAny discussion on the creation of a new global \nsustainable development agenda must have at its core \nthe means of implementation. Indeed, the means of \nimplementation must be the foundation on which \nthe agenda is based. We know that MDG 8, global \npartnership for development, remains one of the least \nfulfilled of all of the Millennium Development Goals. \nThe international community can therefore ill afford \nto let the new development agenda fail as a result of \na lack of adequate and reliable means to implement \nit. The means of implementation must encompass \nfar more than financing. As we use the sixty-ninth \nsession to complete the framework of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, it is incumbent upon us to ensure \nthat definitive and durable partnerships are made to \nfacilitate the following elements \u2014 first, the provision \nof adequate financial and other resources; secondly, \nfair trade and market access; and thirdly, technology \ntransfer and capacity-building, particularly in the area \nof data collection and statistical analysis.\n\nMy country sees peace and security as enablers and \nindicators of sustainable development. They constitute \nindispensable prerequisites for human, social and \neconomic development, as well as for progress and \nprosperity. Barbados therefore views the continuing \ncrises and armed conflicts, including those in the \nCentral African Republic, South Sudan, Syria, Iraq and \nUkraine, with grave concern. Indeed, we view them \nwith grave alarm. Armed non-State actors and terrorist \ngroups continue to destroy lives, destabilize nations and \nthreaten national and international peace and security.\n\nIn the face of such hostilities and blatant acts of \naggression, the Security Council has been paralysed. \nBarbados will continue to be actively engaged within \nthe Caribbean Community in negotiations on the reform \nof the Security Council. We applaud Ambassador Ashe, \nformer President of the General Assembly, for his \n\n\ninitiative to move discussions on the issue forward. We \nalso welcome the summary of the intergovernmental \nnegotiations on Security Council reform prepared by \nthe Chair of the Open-ended Working Group. Barbados \ncalls on all Member States to work assiduously during \nthe current session to make substantial progress, if \nnot to finalize, the decades-long project of Security \nCouncil reform.\n\nMy country reiterates its commitment to democracy \nand the respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms. We welcome the discussions that will take \nplace during this session on the responsibility to protect. \nOur position is motivated by principle and objectivity, \nand we have no desire to see the issue politicized.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak constitutes a public-health \nemergency of international concern and a threat to \nglobal security. It also threatens the peacebuilding and \ndevelopment gains of the countries most affected. It \nis our sincere hope that the recently adopted Security \nCouncil resolution 2177 (2014) and General Assembly \nresolutions 69/1 and 69/3 will accelerate the mobilization \nof resources to assist the affected countries and halt the \nepidemic.\n\nBarbados has long supported a negotiated two-\nState solution to the question of Palestine, the right of \nthe Palestinian people to self-determination and their \nright to live in peace and security in a Palestinian State \nwithin pre-1967 borders. Barbados\u2019s position is that \nthe State of Israel has a right to exist and the people of \nIsrael have a right to live in security and to do so with \nthe full and undisputed recognition of the rest of the \nworld. The Palestinians are also entitled to enjoy the \nfruits of prosperity within their own sovereign State. \nThis year\u2019s unprecedented escalation of the crisis in \nPalestine revealed, yet again, the urgent need to reach a \ndurable, negotiated solution, and we call on all parties \nto rededicate themselves to achieving that aim.\n\nThe long-standing economic embargo on Cuba \ncontinues to be of serious concern to Barbados. The \nGovernment of Cuba has always demonstrated a \nwillingness to assist the Caribbean, and indeed the \ndeveloping world, in our quest for development. We join \nwith the overwhelming majority of States Member of the \nUnited Nations in opposing that unilateral action and \nlook forward to a time \u2014 the sooner, the better \u2014 when \nit will be relegated to the pages of history.\n\nIn closing, Barbados believes that there is an \ninextricable link among development, international \npeace and security. As we stated in 1993, within the \ncontext of an \u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d,\n\n\u201cWhere access to food, clothing, shelter, education, \nhealth and the opportunity for gainful employment \nis denied, democracy cannot flourish\u201d (A/48/PV.26, \np. 11).\nWe also hold the converse to be true. There can \nbe no real development without respect for human \nrights, the rule of law and democracy. We hope that \nmuch of the time and energy of this body at its sixty-\nninth session will be spent on delivering a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda that will redound to the benefit of \nus all. Barbados will continue to be in the vanguard of \nthat effort.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first warmly \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-ninth session. My commendations go to His \nExcellency Mr. John Ashe for his remarkable leadership \nof the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\n\nOver the past few months, we have been reminded \nof the challenges that we collectively face in the Middle \nEast, with the brutality of a terrorist organization that \nhas forced entire populations to flee and sent shock \nwaves around the globe, in Africa, with the spread \nof the Ebola virus disease, and, in Europe, with the \ncontinued aggression by the Russian Federation against \nUkraine. It was in order to deal with challenges such as \nthose that the United Nations was created. It is because \nchallenges such as those continue to exist that we need \nstrong international cooperation with a strong United \nNations at its core.\n\nWe welcome the fact that the international \ncommunity has come together to deal with the \nchallenge posed by the terrorist group that calls itself \nthe Islamic State and to take joint action to address the \nthreat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. Sweden is \npart of that common effort. When the Iraqi Government \nrequested assistance in halting that terrorist group and \nin providing relief for its victims, Sweden was one of \nthe countries that responded by offering additional \nhumanitarian support.\n\nAt the same time, we must remember that neither \nhere nor elsewhere in the region can crises be resolved \nby humanitarian or military means alone. Political \nengagement is, and will remain, indispensable.\n\nWe must support the new Iraqi Government, just \nas we must pursue a political solution to the conflict in \nSyria. We must do our utmost, on both sides, to reach an \nagreement with Iran on its nuclear dossier. Furthermore, \nwe must seek a lifting of the closure regime on Gaza, \nas well as a restart of negotiations between Israelis and \nPalestinians, with the aim of ending the occupation \nand, at last, achieving a viable two-State solution.\n\nWe welcome the readiness displayed this week here \nat the United Nations to take strong collective action \nin support of the countries affected by the devastating \nEbola outbreak in West Africa. Sweden, together \nwith others, has provided substantial support. We are \ncurrently considering further steps to help those who \nare affected.\n\nFor decades, Sweden has been a close partner to \nAfrica and will continue working with the growing, \ndemocratic and economically successful Africa that \nwe see emerging, as well as with the parts of that \ncontinent that are still struggling with poverty, conflict \nand disease. True to that ambition, in the conviction \nthat security and development belong together, our \nengagement in peacebuilding and our contribution to \nthe implementation of the New Deal for Engagement in \nFragile States with regard to Somalia and Liberia will \ncontinue.\n\nRussian acts of aggression and the illegal \nannexation of Ukrainian territory constitute serious \nbreaches of international law and have created a \nsecurity crisis in Europe, entailing significant risks \nto global stability. When a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council, the body entrusted with the primary \nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \npeace and security, attacks a sovereign country without \nany justification whatsoever, the world must react \nresolutely. If aggression is tolerated, there is no telling \nwho the next victim will be. If we accept the changing \nof borders by force, we also accept reopening the most \npainful chapters of our history.\n\nDefending the principles of international law, \nincluding the inviolability of borders, must be a \nresponsibility and an interest of all States. The Security \nCouncil should have formed the first line of defence \nfor those principles. Too many Governments around the \nworld have stayed silent when they should have spoken.\n\nWhile a great deal has been accomplished since \nthe adoption of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), we cannot accept the fact that hundreds of \nmillions of people are still lagging behind \u2014 many \nof them in conflict-affected and fragile States. It is \ntherefore important to accelerate efforts to address the \nunfinished business of the MDGs.\n\nThe United Nations has successfully presided over \na post-2015 consultation process with a near-global \nreach. All actors involved should be commended \nfor that. Sweden will now actively contribute to the \nintergovernmental deliberations in 2015 on the new \nuniversal development framework. With that in mind, \nwe look forward to the Secretary-General\u2019s synthesis \nreport as a further guide for our work.\n\nThe world needs a transformative and universal \nnew framework for sustainable development. The \nnew goals will need to be accompanied by a strong \nmonitoring and accountability framework, allowing \nus to measure progress and ensure accountability at \nall levels, thereby ensuring that the global goals are \ntranslated into actions that makes a real difference for \nreal people. To achieve the new goals, the agenda must \nbe accompanied by a broad international consensus on \nfinancing for development and effective partnerships \nfor sustainable development. The United Nations, for \nits part, must be fit for that purpose so as to take on the \npost-2015 development challenges in an effective way.\n\nThe time leading up to the adoption of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda will be filled with challenging \nnegotiations. However, Sweden is confident that, one \nyear from now, we can arrive at a package that provides \na solid basis for a future that is more prosperous, more \ngender-equal, more peaceful, more democratic, more \nrespectful of human rights and more sustainable for us \nand our children.\n\nNeither development nor peace is possible without \na strong focus on the role of women. By empowering \nwomen, we simultaneously promote both peace and \ndevelopment. Gender equality is not only just economics \nbut also smart economics. A fundamental step towards \ngender equality is to ensure for women their sexual and \nreproductive health and rights, including freedom from \nviolence. We have the normative frameworks in place, \nincluding Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \non women, peace and security. The time has come to \ntranslate those norms into action.\n\nOne of the most serious global challenges is that \nof climate change. The impact is hardest on the world\u2019s \npoorest and most vulnerable populations. Even if we \nmanage to limit the increase in temperature, the world \nwill experience significant adverse effects, especially \nin low-lying vulnerable island States. Sweden has \nsuccessfully demonstrated that it is possible to separate \ngreenhouse gas emissions and economic growth. Since \n1990, we have reduced our emissions by more than \n20 per cent while experiencing economic growth of \n60 per cent. For several years, Sweden has been a top \ncontributor to climate financing, not least through our \ndevelopment cooperation, with a focus on adaptation in \nthe least developed and most vulnerable countries.\n\nTogether with Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, the \nRepublic of Korea, Norway and the United Kingdom, \nSweden initiated the Global Commission on the \nEconomy and Climate. The Commission\u2019s recent report \nbrings good news. Its recommendations will bring net \neconomic benefits to countries at all income levels, \nincluding new jobs, cleaner air, better health, lower \npoverty and more energy security. The report, \u201cBetter \nGrowth, Better Climate\u201d, points to a new and better \ndirection for our future.\n\nIn Paris in 2015, we will have a common \nresponsibility to reach a global and legally binding \nagreement that keeps us below the 2\u00b0C target. We must \nredouble our efforts to ensure that the Paris summit is \na success.\n\nThroughout history, people have moved between \ncountries, regions and continents in pursuit of a better \nlife. Today, numerous crises and conflicts have forced \nmore people from their homes worldwide than at any \ntime since the Second World War. The responsibility \nfor giving shelter and protection is most often borne by \nneighbouring countries. The international community \nis called upon to increase its solidarity and to strengthen \ninternational protection for those who need it. Sweden \nis heeding that call through its refugee policy and its \ntradition of being a place of refuge for people fleeing \npersecution and oppression. Last year, Sweden was the \nfifth largest donor to the Office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. In recent years, \n\nSweden has been one of the top resettlement countries \nin the world.\n\nThe debate on migration often revolves around \nproblems and challenges. The fact is that migration \noffers huge opportunities and is a powerful enabler of \ndevelopment. Migration contributes to development and \nreduces poverty for migrant households. It also helps to \nfill needs in the labour market and to encourage trade \nand investment. Coordinated action and strong global \ncooperation are needed to maximize the positive effects \nof migration. Sweden is actively engaged in such global \nefforts, including, recently, through our chairmanship \nof the Global Forum on Migration and Development.\n\nSweden is currently the second largest recipient of \nasylum-seekers in the European Union and by far the \nlargest on a per capita basis. The makeup of migration \nflows to our country has varied over time, but those \nwho have come to our country have in common that \nthey have all enriched our society. They have further \nopened our eyes to other peoples\u2019 suffering and created \ncloseness to the outside world.\n\nSweden\u2019s commitment to disbursing 1 per cent of \nits gross national income in development assistance, \nincluding our substantial contributions to the different \nparts of the United Nations system, enjoys strong \npopular support. The same goes for the public backing \nof our participation in United Nations peacekeeping. \nSome 80,000 Swedes have served in United Nations \npeacekeeping missions over the years, with our \nlatest deployment being our contribution of forces \nto the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in Mali, which is currently under \nway.\n\nSweden is a candidate for a seat on the Security \nCouncil in 2017-2018, with the support of the Nordic \ncountries. We strongly believe that global challenges \nrequire multilateral governance structures that are \neffective and legitimate. A strong and well-functioning \nUnited Nations is at the heart of that system. Continued \nUnited Nations reform aimed at improving our ability to \npromote peace and security, reduce poverty, contribute \nto sustainable development, alleviate suffering and \nincrease respect for human rights is a work in progress, \nto which we all must contribute. Sweden is prepared to \ndo its part.\n\nI will make one final point. It is now 53 years \nsince Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld lost his life while on \nmission in Africa. Sweden welcomes the report of the \nHammarskj\u00f6ld Commission on the death of Secretary-\nGeneral Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (A/68/800, annex) and \nthe request by the Secretary-General to the General \nAssembly to consider it. We join the Secretary-General \nin encouraging Member States to declassify any relevant \nrecords that may bring new evidence with regard to the \ncrash of his plane. We welcome all that can be done to \nachieve further clarification of that matter. Such actions \nshould be carried out with due regard for the integrity \nof Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and the other individuals who \nwere killed, their families and their memory.\n"

        "file_text": "What and where \nis global power? I say that global power is here in this \nHall, and it is ours if our countries work as one. That is \nthe great promise of the General Assembly. The times \ndemand that we exercise that power now and to the full.\n\nIn my region, the challenges have grown significantly \nsince I spoke here last year (see A/68/PV.5). Those \nwho say \u201cThis is not our business\u201d are wrong. The \nsecurity of every nation will be shaped by the fate of \nthe Middle East. Together, we can and must undertake \nurgent humanitarian and security measures, create \ndurable solutions for today\u2019s crises and provide new \nopportunities for dialogue, reconciliation, prosperity \nand peace.\n\nThe terrorists and criminals targeting Syria, Iraq \nand other countries today are extreme reflections of \na global threat. Our international community needs a \ncollective strategy to contain and to defeat those groups. \nMy country is at the forefront of that effort. We are \nleading a number of initiatives to counter extremism. \nAs the representative of the Asia-Pacific bloc on the \nSecurity Council, we seek a strong outcome of the \n\n\nSecurity Council summit on threats to international \npeace and security caused by terrorist acts, to be \nchaired by President Obama this afternoon.\n\nAnother critical global focus must be a decisive \naffirmation of mutual respect within and among \nreligions and peoples. The teachings of true Islam \nare clear: sectarian conflict and strife are utterly \ncondemned. Islam prohibits violence against Christians \nand the other communities that make up each country. \nLet me say once again that Arab Christians are an \nintegral part of my region\u2019s past, present and future. \nI call on Muslim and other leaders to work together \nagainst falsehoods and divisive actions.\n\nJordan is honoured to have spearheaded global \ninterfaith and intrareligious initiatives. Building on \nthat, Jordan will introduce a draft resolution covering \nthe general proposal that a new international offence, \nfalling under the crimes of genocide and crimes against \nhumanity, be considered on the basis of the aberrant \nnew crimes against religious communities seen recently \nin Syria and in Iraq.\n\nTogether, let us also address the conditions that \nextremists exploit. Radicalization thrives on injustice, \ninsecurity and marginalization. The Assembly\u2019s \ntransformative development agenda can give the \nworld\u2019s people a better way forward through concrete \nprogrammes and investments that will change lives.\n\nWe must also work actively for consensus-driven \npolitical solutions to regional crises. The security \nsituation in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon must be addressed \ncomprehensively. Jordan supports a united and stable \nIraq with an inclusive national political process. In \nSyria, there must be a political solution based on \nreforms that give all communities a role in rebuilding \ntheir country. International influence is vital to bring \nthe moderate opposition and the regime back to the \nnegotiating table immediately.\n\nThe heavy flow of Syrian refugees continues. My \ncountry is sheltering nearly 1.4 million Syrians. We \nare now host to the world\u2019s third-largest number of \nrefugees, and that is placing an overwhelming burden \non Jordan\u2019s people, infrastructure and already limited \nresources. The refugee crisis is a recognized global \nresponsibility and demands a global solution. To date, \nthe response has not kept pace with the real needs. \nThere must be a concerted effort to get humanitarian \nassistance flowing inside Syria and to support host \ncountries and communities, including Jordan.\n\nWe cannot address the future of my region without \naddressing its central conflict: the denial of Palestinian \nrights and statehood. This year, yet again, we have \nseen a dangerous halt in the progress towards peace \nand a Palestinian State. Instead, in Gaza, we have seen \nanother violent detour into conflict. How shall we heal \nthe families who have lost so much? How shall we offer \nhope to young people whose futures are at risk? A first \nimperative step is to mobilize international efforts to \nrebuild Gaza. As we do so, we must also marshal the \nunited global response needed to achieve a once-and-\nfor-all lasting settlement. Such action can create the \nenvironment necessary to relaunch the final status \nnegotiations on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nThat approach offers a clear path \u2014 the only \npath \u2014 to a comprehensive settlement based on the \ntwo-State solution, international legitimacy and the \nterms of reference. For Israel, it offers security and \nnormal diplomatic and economic relations with Arab \nand Muslim States and, for Palestinians, a viable and \nindependent sovereign State, within the 1967 lines, \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. Unilateral actions \nthat seek to pre-empt negotiations must end. Jordan \nstrongly opposes threats to the Arab, Muslim and \nChristian identity of Jerusalem. As the Hashemite \ncustodian of Jerusalem\u2019s Muslim and Christian Holy \nSites, I will continue to oppose any violation of the \nsanctity of the Al-Aqsa mosque.\n\nThe people of Palestine seek what all humans \nseek. It is the common cause of the General Assembly: \njustice, dignity, opportunity and hope. That is our \nglobal responsibility. It is in our global power, and we \nmust make it our global reality. Jordan stands ready to \ndo its part."

        "file_text": "I address \nthe General Assembly at a very special moment, not \nonly for the world but also for my country. I would \nlike to begin by reflecting on the words with which \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened this sixty-\nninth session of the General Assembly. He went over \nmany of the problems, tragedies and calamities that are \nunsettling the world today, and I think, if I remember \ncorrectly, that he literally confirmed that the turmoil, \nas he defined it, that is upsetting the world today is \nendangering multilateralism.\n\nI sincerely believe that most of the problems that \nthe planet has today economically and financially, with \nrespect to terrorism and security, in terms of force and \nterritorial integrity, of war and peace, are the result \nof the exact opposite: the absence of an effective, \npractical and democratic multilateralism. That is why, \nI would like to begin today in particular by thanking \nand congratulating the General Assembly for adopting \n\n\nresolution 68/304, on 9 September, by which it finally \ndecided by a wide majority of 124 votes to dedicate \nitself to drafting a multilateral convention which will \nbe a regulatory legal framework for restructuring the \nsovereign debts of all countries, a task that we needed \nto take on.\n\nI have been coming to the General Assembly since \n2003, first as a Senator, and then, starting in 2007, as \nPresident. We always came calling for reform of the \nSecurity Council and of the International Monetary \nFund. Our point of departure was the experience we had \nin my country, the Argentine Republic. Today, I would \ngo so far as to say in this international context that my \ncountry, the Argentine Republic, is a triple leading \ncase in terms of economics and finance, terrorism and \nsecurity, and force and territorial integrity.\n\nThe first area is the economic and financial crisis \nthat spread throughout the world starting in 2008, \nwhich persists to this day and which is beginning to \nthreaten emerging economies whose greater economic \ngrowth we have supported over the past decade. The \n2008 crisis was experienced by my country in 2001, \nwhen the largest default on sovereign debt in living \nmemory occurred. At the time, the Argentine Republic \nhad accrued debt representing 160 per cent of the gross \ndomestic product, with the consent of multilateral \norganizations, because when one is speaking about that \nlevel of debt, the problem is not just that of the debtor, \nbut also of the creditors.\n\nStarting with the dictatorship on 24 March 1976, \nand through the neoliberal period, Argentina was a \nfavourite of the International Monetary Fund. In the \nend, Argentina accumulated an unprecedented debt \nthat caused the country to implode, not just in economic \nterms but also in political terms. We had five presidents \nin a single week. At that point, nobody claimed \nresponsibility for what had taken place in Argentina. \nArgentina had to resolve its problems as best it could, \nand in 2003, a few months after taking office, a President \nwho had come to head the Government with only 22 per \ncent of the vote came to speak at the General Assembly \n(see A/58/PV.11) and maintained that it was necessary \nto generate a model of development and growth for the \ncountry so that the country could shoulder its debt. \nHe maintained, in a rather interesting metaphor, that \ndead people do not pay their debts and that countries \nhave to live, develop and grow in order to meet their \nobligations.\n\nBut he also said that the level of debt \u2014 160 per cent \nof the gross domestic product \u2014 was not our country\u2019s \nresponsibility alone; that we as a country were accepting \nresponsibility for having adopted policies that had \nbeen forced upon us; that while we were shouldering \nour responsibility, we were also requesting and calling \nfor the multilateral organizations like the International \nMonetary Fund and the creditors themselves, which \nhad lent money at usurious rates \u2014 at that time as high \nas 14 per cent in United States dollars \u2014 which were \nreceiving payments in the Argentine Republic, to also \nassume part of the responsibility for that indebtedness.\n\nAnd with that man \u2014 who took over with 22 per \ncent of the vote, with 25 per cent unemployment, a \n54 per cent poverty rate and 27 per cent of extreme \npoverty, without education, without health, without \nsocial security, over time, with a model of development \nand growth \u2014 we were able not only to create millions \nof jobs, millions of people becoming integrated in \nthe social security system, including retirees and \npensioners, but also to invest 6 per cent of the gross \ndomestic product in education, and set aside enormous \namounts of money for the country\u2019s infrastructure, \nbuilding roads, schools, nuclear plants, hydroelectric \nplants, water, gas and electricity plants that now cover \nthe entire country, in an unprecedented programme of \nsocial inclusion that has allowed to reduce poverty and \nextreme poverty to single digits.\n\nToday, the International Monetary Fund itself \nrecognizes that Argentina\u2019s economic growth between \n2004 and 2011 is the third-largest globally in terms of \nquality of growth. Only Bulgaria and China are ahead \nof us. In Latin America, we have the greatest quality of \ngrowth and the best purchasing power for our workers \nand salaried employees and the highest social security \ndeposits.\n\nWe have been able to achieve all of that while \nalso dealing with debt that others had generated. It is \nworth repeating that our Governments were not the \nones that declared a default, nor were they the ones \nthat had assumed the debt; we were simply the ones \nwho shouldered the debt, as appropriate, and paid, from \n2003 to today, more than $190 billion \u2014 I repeat, more \nthan $190 billion \u2014 by restructuring the defaulted debt \nwith 92.4 per cent of creditors through two debt swaps, \none carried out by President Kirchner in 2005 and the \nother carried out by me in 2010.\n\nWhat is certain is that we were successful. We \nsucceeded because 92.4 per cent of Argentina\u2019s \n\ncreditors regularized their situation. We began to \nmake regular payments, and not only to them. We \nalso fully paid our debt to the International Monetary \nFund through so-called stand-by arrangements. We \nwere able to completely cancel our debt with the \nInternational Monetary Fund. A few months ago, we \nalso concluded negotiations with the Paris Club on \na debt dating back to 1956. It was so long ago that I \nwas three years old when that debt was created and the \nMinister of the Economy of my country, who discussed \nthe restructuring and renegotiation of the debt with \nthe Paris Club, was not even born. Yet we reached an \nagreement with 19 European Union finance ministers \nto finally restructure the debt. We are now paying the \nfirst phase of $642 million.\n\nThis does not end there. We also regularized the \nsituation with the rulings of the International Centre \nfor Settlement of Investment Disputes at the World \nBank, which has begun hearings not for acts or actions \ncommitted by our Government, but for the actions \nof previous Governments that ended up in the World \nBank tribunal. We have also resolved that issue, just \nas we arrived at an arrangement with Repsol when we \ndecided to regain control of our energy resources and \nexpropriated 51 per cent of the oil company\u2019s shares. We \nalso restructured that debt and reached an agreement.\n\nWe have done all this with our own resources, \nwithout access to capital markets because Argentina, \ndue to the default of 2001, was denied access to capital \nmarkets. This represents a process of unprecedented \nsocial inclusion. Why do I say \u201cunprecedented\u201d? \nDuring the 1950s there were similar inclusion \nprocesses in my country, but the difference is that we \ninitiated this process of inclusion after complete and \nutter bankruptcy. At the peak of default, we were able \nto overcome default, to include the people of Argentina \nand to enjoy social growth with inclusion. And today \nArgentina is extricating itself, and in addition we have \none of the lowest debt ratios in the world.\n\nThe other leading case to which I referred and now \nwish to discuss is the emergence of the so-called vulture \nfunds. That is not a term used by any popular South \nAmerican leader or by any African ruler, although \nAfrican countries have also been major victims of \nthese vulture funds. One of the first global leaders to \nmention them was the former English Prime Minister \nGordon Brown at the General Assembly in 2002. This \nexpression became the copyrighted shorthand for \nsomething unworthy and immoral that kept countries \nfrom addressing the genuine problems of education, \nhealth and poverty. Today, with the support of the \njudicial system of this country, Argentina is now being \nassaulted by these vulture funds.\n\nWhat are these vulture funds? They represent the \n1 per cent of debt-holders that did not take part in the \n2005 restructuring. They could not participate because \nthey had purchased bonds in 2008. As everyone knows, \nthese are specialized funds, as indicated by their \nnames, that purchased funds or shares of countries \nthat had defaulted on their debt or were about to do \nso. Subsequently, they did not revert to the country in \nquestion for the payment of that debt, but brought suits \nin various jurisdictions in order to make exorbitant \nprofits. \u201cProfits\u201d is hardly the right word, because what \nhas been recognized in a judgment passed down here \nin the jurisdiction of New York is that this 1 per cent \ngrew at a rate of 1,608 per cent in a five-year period. \nIs there any business, undertaking or investor earning \n1,600 per cent in just five years? That is why they are \ncalled vulture funds. Today, they are obstructing the \nrecovery of that 92.4 per cent who trusted in Argentina.\n\nI am therefore pleased that the Assembly has taken \nthe bull by the horns, and I hope that between this year \nand next \u2014 before the General Assembly holds its new \nsession in 2015 \u2014 we will have arrived at a regulatory \nframework to restructure sovereign debts. The point \nis to engage in an exercise in active and constructive \nmultilateralism so that no other country will have to \nexperience what Argentina \u2014 a country that has the \nability and willingness to pay its debts despite the \nharassment of these vulture funds \u2014 has been through.\n\nThese vulture funds also threaten and hold the \neconomy of our country hostage by provoking rumours, \nslander and libel from the personal to the economic and \nfinancial, so that they sometimes act as a destabilizing \nfactor in the economy. Those who set bombs are not the \nonly terrorists; those who destabilize the economy of a \ncountry and create poverty, misery and hunger through \nthe sin of speculation are economic terrorists. That is \nwhat we want to spell out. That is why we strongly \nadvocate the establishment of a multilateral convention \nsoon and expeditiously, not just for Argentina, but \nfor the rest of the world. We believe that a financial \nand economic balance that addresses the social and \neconomic disparities among countries and within \nsocieties will also be a great antidote to those who \nrecruit young people who have no hope in the future \nand enrol them in crazy crusades. We must all lament \n\n\nthat. We can see only the surface of the phenomenon; we \nalso have to delve deeply into the causes that mobilize \npeople.\n\nWe also talked about my country as a triple leading \ncase on terrorism and security. My country is the only \ncountry of the Americas other than the United States of \nAmerica that was the target of terrorist attacks: one in \n1992 when the embassy of Israel was blown up, and the \nsecond in 1994 when the headquarters of the Asociaci\u00f3n \nMutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) was bombed. This \nyear marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing \nof AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly \u2014 in the \npresence of some of the family members of the victims \nwho have always been with us \u2014 that the Government \nheaded by President Kirchner did the utmost and went \nthe greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits, not \nonly because it opened all my country\u2019s intelligence \nfiles and created a special prosecutor investigation unit, \nbut also because, when in 2006 the justice system of \nmy country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in \nthe bombing of AMIA, I myself was the only President \nwho dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of \nIran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation.\nThat request was made intermittently from 2007 to \n2011, until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed \nto a bilateral meeting, allowing it to be included in \nthe agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both \ncountries of a memorandum of understanding on \nlegal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens \nwho had been accused, and who live in Tehran, to be \ndeposed before the judge.\n\nBut what happened when we signed that \nmemorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken \nout, both nationally and internationally. The Jewish \nassociations that had sought our support for so many \nyears and that had come here with us to ask for help \nturned against us, and when an agreement was finally \nreached on legal cooperation they accused us of \ncomplicity with the State of Iran.\n\nThe same thing happened here in the United States. \nWhen the vulture funds lobbied before the United \nStates Congress, they accused us of collaborating \nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran, which at the time \nwas known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even \nlobbied on their websites, posting pictures of me on the \nInternet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we \nwere business partners. Just this week, we learned that \nthe iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel, in this city, was the \nsetting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of \nthis country and his Iranian counterpart.\n\nWe are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary, \nanything that represents dialogue and understanding \nseems very good to us. But we wish to ask those who \nhave been accusing Iran of being a terrorist State \u2014 and \nI am not speaking here of the last century, but of last \nyear \u2014 what they would say today about the members \nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), \nmany of whom not so long ago were called freedom \nfighters when they were fighting in Syria against the \nGovernment of Bashar Al-Assad. And this is where \nI believe we have another problem with respect to \nsecurity and terrorism. The major Powers too often and \ntoo easily seesaw from the concept of friend to enemy, \nand terrorist to non-terrorist. We need to agree once and \nfor all not to use international politics or geopolitical \npositions to determine positions of power. I say that as \na militant opponent of international terrorism.\n\nBy the way, just to add a touch of color, ISIS has \napparently issued a threat against me that is under legal \ninvestigation in my country. The threat apparently has \ntwo justifications: first, because of my close relationship \nwith His Holiness Pope Francis, and secondly, because \nI recognize the need for two States, Israel and Palestine. \nWhile I am at it, let me reiterate my call on the Assembly \nto recognize Palestine once and for all as a State with \nfull membership in this body. We have to begin to undo \nsome of the Gordian knots \u2014 because there is not just \none Gordian knot but several \u2014 regarding the situation \nin the Middle East, which involves recognizing the \nState of Palestine, Israel\u2019s right to live securely within \nits borders, and Palestine\u2019s right not to be subjected to \nthe kind of disproportionate use of force that led to the \ndeaths of hundreds of women and children, which we \ncondemn just as we also condemn those who attack \nIsrael with missiles.\n\nIn a time of economic vultures and hawks of war, \nwe need more doves of peace to build a safer world. We \nneed more respect for international law and more equal \ntreatment of those seated in this Hall. Just this morning, \nI overheard one leader refer to the use of force to attack \nthe territorial integrity of a country.\n\nHere too, the Republic of Argentina is a leading \ncase. For more than 100 years, we have had a claim \nagainst the United Kingdom on a matter of sovereignty. \nWe once again ask the Assembly to call on the United \nKingdom to sit down with Argentina to discuss the \n\n\nmatter of the sovereignty of the Malvinas. No one \ncares and there is not a single veto from the Security \nCouncil, because Argentina is not a member of the \nSecurity Council and is not even among the countries \nthat decide what happens in the world. So long as \nthat continues, and so long as the votes of the five \npermanent members of the Security Council are worth \nmore than the votes of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, \nEgypt, Uganda, Argentina, Bahrain or the United Arab \nEmirates, nothing will be resolved. We will just have \nthe same speeches we hear every year without arriving \nat a resolution.\n\nThe Assembly must fight to take back the \npowers it delegated to the Council, since \u2014almost \nparadoxically \u2014 the Assembly has to ask the Council \nfor permission on its decisions or on whether to admit \na member. We need to reassert that the Assembly is a \nsovereign body of the United Nations, and that each of \nus is worth one vote in a true global democracy. Not \neverything will be resolved when that global democracy \nis respected to the letter, but I do believe it will mark \nthe beginning of a solution. I am neither a pessimist \nnor an optimist; I consider myself to be a realist. In any \nevent, the child of pessimism and optimism is always \noptimism, but with realism. Optimism without realism \nis either ingenuity or cynicism. I do not wish to appear \ningenuous or cynical before this audience.\n\nI want to convey what we really think in my country. \nWe have long demanded reform of the Security Council \nand of the International Monetary Fund. In 2003, \nreform the International Monetary Fund seemed almost \ninevitable; today, hardly anyone remembers the idea of \nreforming the International Monetary Fund, because \nit no longer plays a central role in decisions. Even the \nInternational Monetary Fund itself and both its current \nhead and former leaders, including Anne Krueger, are \nalso calling for reforms with respect to the restructuring \nof sovereign debts. So long as there is no international \ntreaty approved by this Assembly, no matter how many \nclauses are imposed by the restructuring, there will \nalways be a Judge Griesa somewhere in the world who \nsays that they are meaningless, and who will end up \napplying usurious taxes to bleed some poor country to \ndeath. That is what is happening, because it seems to \nme that they are trying to overturn the restructuring of \nsovereign debt for which the Argentine people worked \nso hard.\n\nBefore coming here I was in Rome, meeting with \na fellow countryman who today occupies a strong, \nexemplary religious and moral leadership. I would like \nto offer a message of peace and of peacebuilding. If \nwe truly wish to fight terrorism, then let us work for \npeace. We cannot fight the terrorists by beating the \ndrums of war. Quite the contrary, that is exactly what \nthey want \u2014 a symmetrical reaction so that the wheel \nagain begins to turn and a price is paid in blood.\n\nThat is why I think it is important for us to think \ndeeply about those issues. Above all, I want to bring \nto the table the certainty that if the United Nations \nrecovers its leadership, if the Assembly resumes its \nmandate, when too many countries fail to comply with \ninternational law, even though they require others to do \nso, then I am certain that we will have made a major \ncontribution to peacebuilding and the fight against \nterrorism from which no one would have been left out. \nBut we have to leave to our children a much better \nworld than the one we have today.\n\nFinally, I wish to recall that a year ago the problems \nwere different. A year ago, we were discussing other \nproblems, other threats to security. Times have \nchanged. The wrongdoers of yesterday do not seem so \nbad today. Those who should have been invaded and \ncrushed a year ago, today seem to be cooperating to \nfight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). \nFirst, it was Al-Qaida, and, I wonder, where did \nAl-Qaida and the Taliban spring from? Where do they \nget their weapons and resources? My country does not \nproduce weapons. Who sells arms to those groups? \nThen there was the Arab Spring, which ended up by \nbeing not so much a spring as a fall and even a winter. \nThose involved went from being freedom-fighters to \nbeing persecuted or imprisoned. Now there is ISIS, a \nnew terrorist organization that carries out beheadings \non television on a carefully set stage. What is causing \nall this, I wonder? Where is this coming from? I have \nbecome really distrustful of everything after seeing \nwhat is happening in the world today \u2014 real-life scenes \nthat make fictional series look trivial.\n\nIt is therefore worth asking ourselves why it is that \nwe are facing ever-greater problems \u2014 problems that \ncaused the Pope to comment that there is practically a \nthird world war. That is true. It is a world war but not \nalong the lines of the more conventional wars of the \ntwentieth century. There are hotspots where the only \nvictims are civilian populations. That is why, a few \nminutes from now in the Security Council, of which \nArgentina is a non-permanent member, we wish to raise \nsome of those issues. We have no certainties, no absolute \n\n\ntruths, but we have many questions. We want to put \nthem to those who possess a lot more information than \nwe do, far more data and far more extensive networks of \ninformation than my country has. Heaven forbid that, \nwith all those data, they have a wealth of information \nbut can understand little of what is happening. For they \nhave to be able to comprehend what is happening if they \nare to come up with a definitive solution.\n\nI deeply appreciate once again the political will of \nthe 124 countries that supported resolution 68/304. As \neveryone knows, there was pressure to keep us from \ngetting that number of supporters or having a vote, \nbut I think that the exercise of practical, effective and \ndemocratic multilateralism that the adoption of the \nresolution represents demonstrates that all is not lost. \nOn the contrary, it is in the hands of each and every one \nof us, each of our countries, to find real and effective \nsolutions to the problems the world has today.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like \nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\n\nIt is a truly a great honour for me to address the \nAssembly for the first time as Prime Minister of India. \nI am humbled by the hopes and expectations of the \npeople of India. I am also mindful of the expectations \nof the world from our 1.25 billion people.\n\nMy country, India, is home to one sixth of \nthe world\u2019s population. It is a nation experiencing \neconomic and social transformation on a scale rarely \nseen in the history of the world. Every country\u2019s world \nview is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical \ntraditions. India\u2019s ancient wisdom sees the world as one \nfamily, and when I say this, I wish to make it clear that \neach country has its philosophy. I am not talking about \nideology. With the inspiration of that philosophy, a \ncountry marches ahead. India is a country that since its \nVedic times, has been saying that the world, the entire \nglobe, is a family. India is a country where, beyond \nnature, we have a communication, a dialogue, with \nnature. We never struggle with nature. That is a part \nof Indian life. The reason is that with that philosophy, \nIndia has been moving forward. Each country and each \nnation is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical \ntradition. India\u2019s ancient wisdom, as I have said, sees \nthe world as one family. India is a country that not only \nspeaks for itself but for worldwide justice, dignity, \nopportunity and prosperity. We have always spoken out \nin support of such issues.\n\nOwing to our ideology, we have a firm belief in \nmultilateralism. Today, as I stand here, I am equally \naware of the hopes and expectations that are pinned on \nthe General Assembly. I am struck by the sacred belief \nthat brought us together. We established the Organization \non the basis of great principles and perspectives, in the \nbelief that if our futures are connected, we will have to \nwork together for peace and security, for human rights \nand for the economic development of all. We must work \ntogether to those ends. At that time, there were only \n51 countries. Today, 193 sovereign flags fly in front of \nthis building. Each new country enters on the basis of \nthe same belief and expectation.\n\nIn the past six decades, we have been able to achieve \na great deal. We have ended many wars. We have \nestablished and maintained peace. We have assisted \neconomic development in many places. We have helped \nto build a future for poor children. We have contributed \ntowards the elimination of starvation and strived to \nsave our planet. The 69 United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions have made the Blue Helmet a symbol of peace \nin the world.\n\nToday, there is a surge of democracy across the \nworld. The peaceful democratic transformation in \nAfghanistan shows that the Afghan people\u2019s aspiration \nfor peace will definitely triumph over violence. We \nhave seen Nepal emerge from war towards peace and \ndemocracy. Bhutan\u2019s young democracy is flourishing. \nThere are also efforts towards democracy in West Asia \nand North Africa. Tunisia\u2019s success shows that such a \npath of democracy is possible. In Africa, there is a new \nmomentum for stability, peace and progress, and a new \nawareness is on the horizon.\n\nWe have seen unprecedented prosperity in Asia and \nbeyond founded on strengthened peace and stability. \nLatin America, a continent of enormous potential, is \ncoming together in the shared pursuit of stability and \nprosperity. That continent may prove to be an important \nanchor for the global community. India looks forward to \na peaceful and stable environment for its development. \nOur future is linked to our neighbourhood. That is why, \nfrom the very first day, my Government gave the highest \npriority to promoting friendship and cooperation with \nour neighbouring countries.\n\nI have the same policy towards Pakistan. I want \nto hold serious bilateral talks with Pakistan in order \nto improve friendship and cooperation in a peaceful \natmosphere, without the shadow of terrorism. I want \nto hold bilateral talks with that country. However, it \nis also Pakistan\u2019s responsibility to come forward and \nto genuinely establish the appropriate atmosphere for \nbilateral talks. In raising that issue in this forum, I do \nnot know how successful our efforts will be. Some \npeople are doubtful.\n\nToday, we need to assist the victims of the floods \nin Kashmir. In India, we have organized large-scale \nassistance. We have not stopped at only India helping \nKashmir. We have also asked Pakistan to assist, since \nthat area was also affected by the floods. We have told \nPakistan that just as we were helping the flood victims \nin India, we would also like to help those in Pakistan. \nWe have proposed that. We are a part of the developing \nworld but have limited resources. We would like to \nshare our modest resources with all those who are in \ndire need of assistance.\n\nToday, the world is witnessing a high level of \ntension and turmoil. There are no major wars, but \ntension and conflict abound. There is an absence of \npeace and uncertainty about the future. Even today, \nthere is rampant poverty everywhere. The Asia-Pacific \n\nregion, which is integrating, is still concerned about \nmaritime security. That is fundamental to its future. \nEurope faces a new threat of division. In West Asia, \nthe dividing lines and terrorism are increasing. In our \nown region, we are still struggling to combat terrorism \nand instability. For the past four decades, we have faced \nsuch a threat.\n\nTerrorism emerges in new forms and under new \nnames. Be it small or large, in the North, the South, \nthe East or the West, no country is free from threats. \nI remember when I met with world leaders 20 years \nago, and we talked about terrorism. They did not quite \nunderstand it and stated that it was a law-and-order \nproblem. Today, the entire world is witness to the slow \nspread of terrorism far and wide.\n\nAre we really making integrated efforts at the \ninternational level to fight against those powerful \ngroups? I know that terrorism is a very serious problem \nfor discussion. Even today, some countries are giving \nrefuge to international terrorists, and they consider \nterrorism a tool of their policy. Good terrorism and bad \nterrorism \u2014 that is what we hear these days. At this \ntime, there is a question mark regarding our struggle to \nfight against terrorism. The brutal return of terrorism \nin West Asia and its impact on countries far and near \nhas elicited a concerted effort, which we welcome. \nHowever, the effort should involve all the countries of \nthe region. If we want to overcome terrorism, then they \nmust all contribute towards its eradication. We strongly \nemphasize this.\n\nOceans, seas, space and cyberspace, besides \ncontributing to our common wealth and prosperity, are \nbecoming new theatres of conflict. In the same oceans \nthat used to connect us, we are today hearing news of \ndisputes. We once saw space as holding out potential \nfor our achievements. Today, in cyberspace, which \nconnects us in important areas, new dangers are being \nseen. International harmony and cooperation \u2014 on \nwhich the United Nations was founded \u2014 are needed \nnow more than ever before. Today, we talk about an \ninterdependent world, but have we become more united \nas nations? We need to think about that.\n\nWhy, when we have a good forum like the United \nNations, do we keep creating so many different groups? \nThere is the Group of Four, the Group of Seven and \nthe Group of 20 \u2014 and the numbers keep changing. \nWhether or not we really want to do so, we, including \nIndia, become members of them. Is it not the time to \nmove on and leave behind those groups? When the \nUnited Nations celebrates its seventieth anniversary, \nhow do we create a Group-of-All atmosphere? How can \nthe General Assembly create an opportunity to solve \nall our problems? How can people begin to be more \ntrustful? How can we become less competitive? We talk \nabout unity, but then we divide the whole into different \nparts and pieces. Can we prevent ourselves from doing \nso?\n\nOn the one hand, we say that our policies are \ninterconnected; on the other, we think in terms of \nzero-sum gains. We think that if the other benefits, I \nstand to lose. Who receives the benefit and who suffers \nthe loss? That is what we appear to be weighing. The \npessimists are cynical. Like them, we are inclined to \nsay nothing will change. It is easy to be cynical and \nto say nothing will change. But if we do that, we run \nthe risk of shirking our responsibilities and putting our \ncollective future in danger.\n\nWe must unite and prepare to meet the needs of our \ntimes. We must really work for global peace. No one \ncountry or group of countries can determine the course \nof the world or its policies. It is imperative to have \ngenuine international participation and partnership. We \nshould try to promote positive dialogue and cooperation \namong countries. Our efforts must begin at the United \nNations.\n\nIt is important that we improve the Security Council \nby making it more democratic and participative. \nInstitutions that reflect the imperatives of the twentieth \ncentury will not be effective in the twenty-first century. \nThey face the risk of irrelevance. I would like to \nemphasize that the policies and rules we made in the \ntwentieth century may no longer be applicable. The \nspeed of change is very fast. It is therefore essential \nthat, in tune with the times, we adapt and reformulate, \nmaking the necessary changes and introducing new \nideas. Only when we have done that will we be relevant.\n\nWe should set aside all our differences and mount \na concerted international effort to combat terrorism \nand extremism. Towards that end, we should adopt a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \nThat is something which is long overdue. It must be \nemphasized that our combined strength to fight against \nterrorism should be reflected in the convention. Our \ncountry, which has endured so many terrorist attacks, \nknows that, so long as the United Nations fails to take \nthe initiative in that effort, and so long as we do not \nadopt a convention, we cannot be successful. In such \nwork, we must not forget to make provision for peace, \n\nstability and order in outer space and cyberspace. We \nmust work together to ensure that all countries observe \ninternational rules and norms.\n\nWe must include the host countries and troop-\ncontributing countries in our decision-making on \nUnited Nations peacekeeping. If they are included, their \nconfidence will increase considerably. They are ready \nto make major sacrifices and to give their time and \nenergy. But if they are excluded from decision-making, \nthen how can United Nations peacekeeping become \nmore vital and urgent? We need to seriously consider \nthat. Today, let us redouble our efforts in pursuit of \nglobal disarmament. Let us also spare no effort to \nensure that we work tirelessly towards those goals.\n\nGlobalization has created new industries and \nsources of employment. At the same time, billions live \nin the shadow of poverty. A great many countries are \nsuffering economic deprivation, barely keeping their \nheads above water. What seems so difficult today was \nnever so difficult in the past. Technology has made many \nthings possible. Reduction in the cost of technology has \nmade it more widely available. If we think of the speed \nwith which Facebook or Twitter have spread around the \nworld and cell-phone use has proliferated, then we must \nalso believe that development and empowerment can \nspread with the same speed.\n\nIt is up to each country to make its own efforts \nat the national level. Each Government must fulfil its \nresponsibilities. International participation is also very \nimportant. At one level, it requires better coordination \nof policy, so that our efforts become mutually \nsupportive, not mutually damaging. It also means that, \nwhen we craft agreements on international trade, we \naccommodate one another\u2019s concerns and interests.\n\nLet us think about the scale of the need. Today, \nbasic sanitation is out of the reach of 2.5 billion people; \n1.3 billion have no access to electricity and 1.1 billion \nno access to drinking water. That makes it clear that \nmore comprehensive and concerted international action \nis required. We cannot keep waiting for economic \ndevelopment. In India, the most important aspects of \nmy development agenda are focused precisely on those \nvery issues, which should also be at the core of the post-\n2015 development agenda, as they deserve our utmost \nattention.\n\nA world that is more habitable and sustainable is an \nobjective we must work towards. There has been much \ndebate and much written about that, but it takes only a \nbrief glance around our countries to become concerned. \nWe are very concerned indeed about issues relating to \nforests, wildlife, birds, rivers, water sources and the \nblue sky above.\n\nI would like to address three points. First, if we \nare to meet all of the challenges, we must fully uphold \nour responsibilities. The global community has \nagreed to work together on the basis of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility. That must continue to be \nthe foundation of future action. That also means that \ndeveloped countries must fulfil their commitments in \nterms of funding and technology transfer.\n\nSecondly, national action is imperative. Technology \nhas made many things possible, such as renewable \nenergy. We need imagination and commitment. India \nstands ready to share its technology and capabilities, as \nfor example through the recently announced free access \nto a satellite.\n\nThirdly, we need to change our lifestyles. Avoiding \nenergy use is the cleanest option and would give a \nnew direction to our economy. For us in India, respect \nfor nature is fundamental and an integral part of \nspiritualism. It is part of our ideology.\n\nI would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to \nanother idea. When we talk of climate change, we are \nalso talking about holistic health care, connecting with \nnature and going back to basics. Today, I would like \nto underscore that yoga is an invaluable gift from our \nancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and \nbody, thought and action. It is important to coordinate \nall of those aspects. Such a holistic approach is valuable \nto our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about \nexercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness \nwith yourself, the world and nature. By changing our \nlifestyle and creating consciousness, it can also help us \ndeal with climate change. Let us work towards adopting \nan international yoga day.\n\nFinally, we are at a historic moment. Every age is \ndefined by its character and remembered for how it \nrose to meet its challenges. Today, we are responsible \nto rise and meet those challenges. Next year, the United \nNations will be 70 years old. We should ask ourselves \nwhether we should wait until we are 80 or 100 years \nold to take action. I believe that next year will provide \nan opportunity for the United Nations. After a voyage \nspanning 70 years, we shall be able to look back and \nreview what we have achieved, whence we began, \nwhy we left certain places, what motivated us, how \n\nwe proceeded and what we have attained. What are \nthe challenges facing us in the twenty-first century? If \nwe can keep all of that in mind, through exchanges of \nviews, dialogue with universities, and intergenerational \ndiscussions with young people, who can contribute \nideas, then we will find the ways to connect all of those \nthings for future generations.\n\nThat is why I say that arriving at the milestone \nof 70 years presents us with a great opportunity that \nwe should not waste. By taking full advantage of this \nmoment, we could achieve a new consciousness, a new \nlife, with new ambitions and aspirations. We could \ngive the journey of the United Nations a new form. I \ntherefore feel that 70 years is a great opportunity for \nus. Let us come together and fulfil our promise to bring \nimprovements to the Security Council. That issue has \nbeen before us for a long time, yet there has not been \nmuch progress. We need to think very seriously about \nit.\n\nIn preparing and implementing the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, let us come together to keep our \npromises. For 2015, let us come together to give a new \ndirection and make the moment memorable by giving \nthe world a new lease on development. The year 2015 \nshould be a banner year in history \u2014 a turning point \nin history. I hope that we will all live up to its promise.\n"

        "file_text": "Like my predecessors, I would like \nfirst of all, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of \nMadagascar and on my own behalf, to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. He is a credit to his country, the Republic of \nUganda, and the pride of the entire African continent.\n\nAllow me next to thank Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his commitment to peace and development \nin the world and for his actions at the head of the \nOrganization. I also take this opportunity to solemnly \nreiterate to him and his team the gratitude of the \nMalagasy people for the special attention and resources \nthat the United Nations system has mobilized in order \nto contribute to the culmination of the process that \nbrought the crisis in Madagascar to an end. We are also \ngrateful for the important role that the United Nations \ncontinues to play in working together with Madagascar \nand its people. I naturally extend that gratitude to the \nentire international community, whose support has \nbeen decisive in the peaceful resolution of the Malagasy \ncrisis.\n\nBy choosing to return to constitutional order \nthrough the ballot box, the Malagasy people confirmed \nits commitment to stability and security. In so doing, it is \nparticipating in building peace and security in the region \nand thus throughout the world. Strengthened by those \nvalues , we have made national reconciliation, which \nis the foundation of social cohesion, the cornerstone \nof our development policy. We are convinced that \nwithout social peace, there can be no development and \nvice versa. We have already taken important steps in \nthat process and we intend to move forward. But our \nresources are not yet commensurate with the scale of \nthe tasks that remain. That is why Madagascar wishes \nto gain access to the Peacebuilding Fund, which is \nbeing made available through the Organization.\n\nFive per cent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is found \nin Madagascar. It behoves us, therefore, to take \nresponsibility for preserving that resource and ensure \nbetter management for future generations. Upon taking \noffice in January 2014, I declared war on traffickers \nin rosewood and all those who engage in the illegal \ntrade in protected species. The establishment of good \nforest governance was the first act in a whole series \n\n\nof concrete measures to that end. An interdepartmental \ncommittee for restructuring the sector was established. \nThe authorities are working hard to achieve the policy \nof zero tolerance against trafficking of all kinds related \nto natural resources and protected species. However, \ndespite our efforts, we must note that traffickers still \nmanage to evade surveillance measures, due to the lack \nof resources at our disposal to deal with traffickers, \nwho have ample resources.\n\nMadagascar\u2019s strategic location in the Indian \nOcean, at the crossroads of various maritime routes \nthat are vital to global trade, means that we must work \nto preserve our fishing areas and our marine reserves. \nThe risk of piracy, terrorism and trafficking of all kinds \nis high. Measures must be taken in that regard, within \nthe framework of an active international cooperation to \nprotect the area.\n\nThe Malagasy Government has also increased the \nextent of protected areas to cover more than 10 per cent \nof the country, or at least 6 million hectares, with the \ncooperation of its partners. A large-scale reforestation \nproject aimed at sustaining the long-term production of \ntimber and firewood is included in the Government\u2019s \nagenda in terms of commitments. We are also \nstrengthening our legal arsenal by ratifying several \nmultilateral environmental agreements, including the \nDoha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\n\nAfter over five years of political crisis, including \nsanctions and suspension measures of all kinds, it is \nclear that the majority of the Millennium Development \nGoals will not be met in Madagascar by 2015. However, \nthe country is committed to focusing its development \nefforts on its population and has initiated major \nprojects in some key sectors such as education, health, \nemployment, security, access to new information and \ncommunication technologies and infrastructure. Thus, \nschool enrolment for girls has far exceeded that for \nboys. Similarly, nearly 500,000 children and youth have \nbeen enrolled in educational and socio-professional \ninstitutions for the year 2014-2015. Over 100 basic \nhealth centres have been opened in recent months \nacross the country. In the framework of our fight against \nmalaria, Madagascar\u2019s efforts have been recognized \nat the continental level, including our achievement of \n95 per cent of households owning at least one mosquito \nnet impregnated with long-lasting insecticide and our \nintra-residential spraying campaign, which are the most \nimportant tools for the prevention of malaria. Moreover, \nMadagascar has demonstrated its solidarity with the \nworld\u2019s fight against Ebola.\n\nIn terms of security, tangible results have been \nachieved in recent months with Operation First Strike, \nwhich is aimed at eradicating the massive theft of \nzebus in the south and west of the country. Finally, \nMadagascar\u2019s renewed adherence to the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act should give new impetus \nto the country\u2019s economic and social fabric with the \nmassive job creation.\n\nWhen it comes to climate change, the stakes are \nhigh for Madagascar, since our economy is based on \ndeveloping sectors that are sensitive to climate change. \nThe numbers are telling in that regard \u2014 75 per cent \nof Madagascar\u2019s population lives in rural areas, of \nwhich 4 million are in vulnerable areas, and 28 per cent \nof the rural population are food-insecure. Although \nwe do not have the means to adequately mitigate the \nnegative effects of climate change on the country\u2019s \nsocio-economic activities, we have nevertheless taken \naction. Measures range from the development of legal \nframeworks such as the national policy for the fight \nagainst climate change, the national strategy for a \nclean development mechanism and the establishment of \nan energy transition policy that is based on the use of \nrenewable energy. We are also implementing a national \naction plan for adaptation and have created various \nstructures to coordinate activities related to climate \nchange.\n\nWe fully support the theme of this session, \n\u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative post-\n2015 development agenda\u201d. Our country is committed \nto creating the conditions to establish a prosperous and \nmodern nation. That is the whole purpose of the actions \nwe have undertaken on the basis of the principles of \ntransparency, good governance, respect for the rights of \nothers, democracy and human rights. With this vision \nof a modern and prosperous nation, our main objective \nis to allow the people to emerge from their precarious \nsituation. To do so, we have decided on a policy of \nimproving production to increase productivity and \ndeveloping a reliable agricultural sector. That will help \nthe country to achieve food self-sufficiency and allow \nMadagascar to become the backbone of food security in \nthe Indian Ocean.\n\nWe have also decided to undertake major public \ninfrastructure works, including structural work, the \nconstruction of highways and roads, works of art, \n\n\nbuilding construction and embellishment, dams, \nwater purification and improvements to the energy \nsector. In that regard, we are developing an innovative \npartnership for finance structuring and partnerships. \nIn addition to conventional financing from traditional \ndonors, we have used a public-private partnership \nsystem. It is aimed at establishing a mutually beneficial \npartnership for Malagasy and investors alike. Particular \nattention is being paid to promoting youth employment, \nand companies that fulfil the required conditions will \nbenefit from strong incentives and tax benefits.\n\nAnother priority area is tourism. Tourist facilities \nare still limited in number and need to be developed. \nMadagascar today is the ideal destination for such \ninvestment, in particular in growth sectors. We \nmust meet the challenges of growth and ensure that \nGovernment actions have a positive and tangible \nimpact on the lives of the 22 million Malagasy through \ninclusive and sustainable development. Madagascar \nhas adopted a transformative agenda for its future. The \ndrafting of the national development plan reflects the \ndetermination of the State to establish the principles \nof good governance and economic recovery. The Plan \nis to be a central frame of reference for private-sector \nengagement with civil society, decentralized local \nauthorities and technical and financial partners. The \nimplementation of the national development plan will \npromote and ensure the security of domestic and foreign \ninvestment and the updating of regulatory frameworks \nrelating thereto.\n\nBefore concluding, I reiterate my country\u2019s \ndetermination to renew and strengthen its commitments \nto the various activities of the United Nations, in \naddition to our effective participation in the regular \nwork of the committees and in various conferences \nheld under the auspices of the Organization. We point \nout the deployment every year of contingents from our \nnational gendarmerie, national police and the Malagasy \npenitentiary administration within various United \nNations peacekeeping operations in Africa. Most \nrecently, the Government of Madagascar has responded \npositively to the United Nations request for 140 officers \nin formed police units to serve in the Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African \nRepublic.\n\n\nMadagascar also continues to advocate for equitable \nrepresentation in the Security Council so that countries \ndirectly involved in crises and conflicts can fully take \npart in the process of the adoption of resolutions.\n\nMadagascar aspires to move rapidly from its current \nstatus to that of a growing country with an expanding, \nvibrant middle class and that will see its income quickly \nrise to match those of emerging countries. I know that \nthis is possible and achievable. I have made a moral \ncontract with the people of Madagascar to optimize our \nuse of our natural and human resources to enable our \ncountry to achieve a solid place within the globalization \nnetwork, to rebuild itself and to contribute in a positive \nway to the resolution of the major problems of this \nworld.\n"

        "file_text": "In the 364 days since I last had \nthe honour to address this Assembly, the world has \nchanged dramatically. We have seen a profound change \nin the global security situation. We see unprecedented \nthreats to peace and security in post-Second World War \nEurope and the world, while terrorism, climate change, \nhuman rights violations and the spread of the Ebola \nvirus continue to be global challenges.\n\nWe need a concerted effort to achieve peace and \nstability in Europe and the Middle East, and to restore \nthe credibility of international law. No circumstances \ncan ever justify terrorism in any form. By signing \nUnited Nations anti-terrorism conventions States have \npromised to prevent and investigate terrorist crimes as \nwell as to refrain from supporting or tacitly tolerating \nthose crimes.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) \nposes a serious threat to the people of Iraq and Syria \nas well as the broader Middle East. This terrorist \norganization executes prisoners, kills civilians and \ncommits genocidal acts against religious and national \nminorities. Its brutality, barbarous crimes and extreme \nideology threaten all of humanity. It challenges the \nuniversal human values enshrined in United Nations \ndocuments. We must stop the terrorists. Estonia \ncommends all global efforts to fight the ISIL and other \nterrorist organizations and stands ready to contribute \nto those efforts. I should like to welcome the adoption \ntoday of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), on \nforeign terrorist fighters.\n\nA quarter of a century ago in the annus mirabilis \n1989, Europe and the democratic world celebrated an \nhistorical sea change. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold \nWar that had divided the world into hostile camps for \nhalf a century ended. This year we should celebrate an \nanniversary of the triumph of freedom and democracy. \nInstead, 2014 has turned out to be a year when the \ninternational order as we have known it since the \ncold war, has been violated and put in doubt. Cynical \ngeopolitics in international relations has once again \ncome to the fore. The international agreements upon \nwhich the stability of the post-Second World War \nsecurity architecture relied, have been compromised.\n\nLet me recall what we have collectively agreed \nupon. The Charter of the United Nations of 1945 \ndeclares:\n\n\u201cAll Members shall refrain in their international \nrelations from the threat or use of force against the \nterritorial integrity or political independence of \nany state\u201d.\nIn the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, all trans-Atlantic \ncountries agreed not to use force to change borders \nor challenge the political independence of any State. \nStates agreed to regard one another\u2019s frontiers as \ninviolable; to refrain from making each other\u2019s territory \nthe object of military organized occupation. No such \noccupation or acquisition would be recognized as legal. \nIn the 1990 Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (CSCE) Charter of Paris for a New Europe, all \nsignatories, from Vancouver to Vladivostok, agreed to \n\u201cfully recognize the freedom of States to choose their \nown security arrangements\u201d.\nBy annexing Crimea and invading Eastern \nUkraine, one of the signatories has violated all of these \nagreements. Thus, we find ourselves in a completely \nnew and unforeseen security environment. We must \nenforce the fundamental agreements upon which our \npeace and security rely.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis is not solely a conflict \nbetween two countries. It is not even solely a European \nissue. If instead of agreements and laws raw brute force \nwill apply in international relations; if changing State \nborders by force will become an accepted norm, then the \nstability of the whole world is threatened. As President \nObama said this morning, \u201cThis is a vision of the world \nin which might makes right\u201d (A/69/PV.6, p. 11). And he \nadded, \u201cWe believe that right makes might\u201d (ibid.). So \ndoes Estonia. We believe that too.\n\n\n\nSuch developments must be firmly condemned. \nThe international community cannot leave Crimea as \nit is now. We cannot accept frozen conflicts created for \ngeopolitical ends. Referendums that are in agreement \nwith international law cannot be arranged in two weeks in \nthe presence of foreign armed forces. The results of such \nreferendums cannot be considered valid. Independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity must remain the \nfundamental rights of States and nations. That includes \ntheir right to direct their own future and to choose their \nallies, as stated in the CSCE Paris Charter. Such free \nchoices by sovereign nations cannot be accepted as an \nexcuse for aggression. However, it was not Ukraine\u2019s \nwish even to choose its security arrangements that was \nused as justification for aggression. Its mere desire to \nenhance trade and political relations with the European \nUnion, which is not a security arrangement, led to the \ncountry\u2019s dismemberment.\n\nWhat can we do, then, to restore the validity of \ninternational agreements? There were warning signs \nof current events in Ukraine earlier. Alarm bells rang \nalready six years ago in Georgia, but few bothered to \nhear the wake-up call. We must take, therefore, conflict \nprevention more seriously. We must support States in \ntheir choice of democracy, the rule of law and human \nrights and decisions that follow from that. These recent \ndevelopments force us seriously to reconsider the role \nof the United Nations. How can one of the fundamental \ngoals of the United Nations, global peace and security, \nbe promoted when basic international agreements are \nignored, State borders are changed, and territories are \nannexed through force?\n\nWe cannot ignore that the Security Council has been \nparalysed as international justice has been manipulated \nand multiple crises have escalated. The Security Council \nneeds to be reformed. Its work methods and principles \nmust be revised, with special attention on the openness, \naccountability and transparency of its processes. The \npermanent members of the Security Council bear \nenormous responsibility in guaranteeing international \npeace. No permanent member should abuse the veto to \ncircumvent the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\nHuman rights remain the most cherished of values \nof the United Nations. Unfortunately, respect for \nhuman rights can still not be assumed to be the norm. \nWe cannot accept arguments that for some countries \nhuman rights do not apply for cultural reasons. Human \nrights, as stated in the Universal Declaration, are \nuniversal, inalienable and inviolable. They are based \non the humanity and dignity of each and every person.\n\nNo peace or justice, stability or security can \nbe guaranteed unless the basic rights of all human \nbeings are respected and protected in every country \nby all Governments. We must, moreover, pay special \nattention to the rights of the most vulnerable groups. \nWomen\u2019s rights must be protected everywhere. It is \ncrucial that empowering women and action against \ngender-based violence be implemented in accordance \nwith Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We must \nrespect the rights of children and minorities, as well as \nthose of indigenous people. We must care for people \nwith special needs.\n\nFree speech remains a crucial right. Some States \nhave made efforts to stop the free flow of information \non the Internet and to divide cyberspace along State \nborders. This we must avoid. The Internet must remain \na universal platform for the uninhibited exchange of \ninformation. Estonia is proud to be a founding member \nof the Freedom Online Coalition, a community of 23 \nnations committed to promoting free speech online, and \nthe multi-stakeholder model of a free and open Internet. \nIt is a global initiative that brings together Governments, \nnon-governmental organizations, entrepreneurs and \nthink tanks.\n\nIn April, the Freedom Online Coalition gathered in \nour capital and issued the Tallinn Agenda, a statement \nexpressing our strongly shared conviction that all people \nare entitled to the same rights and freedoms, online as \nwell as offline. This is not a lifestyle question. The \nInternet is a driver of economic growth and a key tool \nfor development. Since the 1990s it has blossomed into a \nglobal network of nearly three billion users. Most of the \nnext billion Internet users will come from developing \ncountries. The United Nations post-2015 development \nagenda should recognize the importance of new \ntechnologies and e-services as a major contribution to \nthe security and prosperity of the world. As we grow \nmore dependent on digital services in our daily lives, \nwe become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Cyber \nsecurity is essential, not just for protecting rights, \nbut also for economic prosperity. Cyberattacks can \nparalyse crucial services or infrastructure. They can \ncause enormous economic damage. Limiting access to, \nor censoring the contents of the Internet, however, is \nnot the answer to cyber insecurity.\n\n\n\nAchieving sustainable development is essential in \norder to tackle some of the challenges we face. Even \nin the current fragile security environment, we must \ntake care of the future of the planet and work towards \na world where everyone can live a dignified life, \nfree from poverty, violence and exclusion. In today\u2019s \ninterdependent world, this is hard to achieve without \npeace and stability.\n\nThe world today also faces the outbreak of a \ndeadly virus. This is no longer a local concern of a \nfew countries. Ebola has become an international \npublic health emergency. Despite efforts already made \nby Governments and international organizations the \noutbreak races ahead. We support the efforts of the \nGlobal Ebola Response Coalition tasked to contain and \nstop the spread of the virus.\n\nClimate change is already an existential threat \nto some countries. It has a dramatic impact on their \nliving conditions and their security. The small island \ndeveloping States are most vulnerable. If we do not act \nsoon enough other countries will be threatened as well. \nWe must see this problem globally, not just from the \nperspective of short-term national or economic interest.\n\nThe risks of conflict, violence, insecurity, financial \nand economic collapse, climate change, lack of resources \nand natural disasters are inextricably intertwined and \nneed to be addressed comprehensively. The new post-\n2015 development agenda must be truly universal. \nSustainable development goals are best addressed \ntogether. Progress in these fields will be guaranteed by \ngood governance, transparency of decision-making and \nlow corruption. Effective and accountable institutions \nare powerful enablers of sustainable development, and \nmodern digital technology helps us to create them. In \nEstonia, we have developed an e-governance system \nthat increases transparency and limits corruption. \nWe have been sharing the system with all interested \npartners and we continue to be willing to do so.\n\nSince 8 May 1945, we have believed that we had \nbeen freed of certain ideological demons for good. Yet \ntoday we see the return of long-discredited ideas dating \nback to 1938. The existence of co-ethnics abroad has \nbeen used as a justification to annex territory. This is in \n2014, not in 1938. So, too, we have seen a return to the \nideologies of hatred, lies and propaganda. We must be \nclear in condemning extreme nationalism, homophobia, \nxenophobia and religious extremism. We need to recall \nand reaffirm the values that the United Nations was \ncreated to protect. The United Nations, a unique global \ninstrument of security and peace, must succeed where \nthe League of Nations once failed.\n\nLet us not forget that 75 years ago, on 23 August \n1939, a pact was signed between Hitler\u2019s Germany \nand Stalin\u2019s Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to \ndivide Eastern Europe into their spheres of influence. \nA week later, on 1 September, Hitler attacked Poland. \nOn 17 September, two and a half weeks later, Hitler\u2019s \nerstwhile ally, the Soviet Union, also attacked Poland, \nand the Second World War had begun.\n\nThe date of 31 August this year marked 20 years \nsince the occupation forces left Estonia \u2014 troops that \nwere there as a result of that same Stalin-Hitler pact. Yet \njust a few days later on 5 September, an Estonian police \nofficer was abducted by foreign security services on \nEstonian territory and taken by force to Moscow, where \nhe is still being held in the infamous Lefortovo prison.\n\nWe cannot allow anyone ever to divide countries \ninto spheres of influence. The community of nations is \nonly secure when its smallest members can feel secure. \nWe cannot and will not accept threats and intimidation \nin twenty-first century international relations. We \ncannot have peace, security or prosperity in Europe, or \nin the world, unless we again find a way to enforce and \nrevalidate the agreements that we have all signed and \nare parties to.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure for me to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \nFirst, allow me to congratulate the President of the \nAssembly on his election to that post and to assure him \nof the full support of my country during this session. \nI believe that, under his leadership and given his prior \nexperience, he will further advance the achievements of \nhis predecessor, who worked with dedication to achieve \nconcrete results.\n\n\nIn addition, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General \nfor his vision and leadership at the helm of the United \nNations and his continuing efforts to revitalize and \nreform the Organization.\n\nAlbania is committed to an efficient and \ncoherent United Nations, fit for its purpose as a \nmultidimensional system. We support its strengthened \nrole and contribution to efforts to preserve peace and \nsecurity, eradicate poverty, inequality and disparity, \nachieve sustainable human and economic development, \nand promote respect for and protect human rights as a \nuniversal value of humankind. A more fitting United \nNations, with the ability to swiftly respond to man-\nmade or natural crises and effectively use available \nhuman and financial resources, is key to achieving \nthose objectives in view of an increasingly chaotic and \nhungry world.\n\nMaintaining, restoring and strengthening peace \nand security constitute one of the three pillars of the \nwork of the United Nations. With so many resources \nand so much knowledge and manpower invested in \ndealing with the various and complex crises around the \nglobe, it is simply impossible to ignore the contribution \nthe Organization has made to the world, year upon \nyear, decade upon decade. Yet in 2014 the challenges \nto peace, security and human values have continued, \nnecessitating more responsive, coordinated and swift \nreactions on the part of the United Nations.\n\nWe deplore the events in South Sudan, where \ntragedies have been played out and continue to shake \nhuman consciences. Fighting along ethnic lines \nhas brought far too much suffering to the innocent \npopulation. Only a negotiated political solution that \nconsiders, protects and respects the rights of all the \ncommunities concerned can help rebuild trust and \nunderstanding, turning the page on a better future for \nthe youngest country in the world.\n\nIt is hard to find the words to describe the situation \nin Syria. After more than three years of deadly fighting, \nthe country is barely liveable. Every kind of horrible \nact has happened there. More than 170,000 people \nhave died, millions are refugees, and large parts of the \ncountry are in ruins. With fighting and mass atrocities \nbeing committed every day, any hope of ending the war \nis a remote dream for those still trapped there. Albania \njoined the initiative taken by some 60 States Members \nof the United Nations to refer the situation in Syria to \nthe International Criminal Court. Unfortunately, like \nmany other initiatives on Syria, the effort was vetoed \nin the Security Council. We reiterate and reaffirm that \nthe perpetrators of atrocities in Syria must be held \naccountable and that the people of Syria deserve relief \nand justice.\n\nThe events this year in Ukraine have been deeply \nworrying. What we thought was behind us once and \nfor all, what we believed belonged to the history books \nand would serve as a lesson for today\u2019s generation and \nthose of the future \u2014 acts violating the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of another country, blatantly \ninfringing and undermining the Charter of the United \nNations \u2014 was unfortunately exhumed by a Member \nof the United Nations, a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council, the Russian Federation.\n\nDespite all the propaganda that Russia spewed \nforth, the Ukrainian crisis had nothing to do with \nprotecting the rights of ethnic Russians. It was much \nsimpler \u2014 from the first, it was about the ambition of a \nmore powerful country to redraw another\u2019s borders in \norder to satisfy its appetite for its neighbour\u2019s territory. \nAlthough the Security Council has been unable to act on \nthis issue, the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly \nnot to accept Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea. \nThe States Members of the United Nations, including \nAlbania, made clear their support for the territorial \nintegrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and their full \nrespect for the norms and principles of international \nlaw, and we reiterate that international relations must be \ngoverned by full respect for the principles and norms of \ninternational law and the Charter. The case of Ukraine \nis no exception.\n\nWith these crises and disasters erupting in a \nfrightening pattern and the world spiraling into \ninsecurity, development has also been under stress. \nThe United Nations has contributed to raising global \nawareness of the challenges facing development and the \nsustainable solutions that can bring economic growth, \nsocial inclusion and environmental protection and put \nour planet on a sustainable path.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ncreated one of the most successful global anti-poverty \ndrives in history. Covering poverty, hunger, maternal \nand child health, gender equality, education and the \nenvironment, the MDGs have seen important progress \nat the national, regional and global levels and have \nimproved the lives of millions. The number of people \nliving in extreme poverty has been halved since 2005, \n\nbut with the deadline just months away, a lot remains \nto be done.\n\nBut another ambitious long-term sustainability \nagenda, designed to succeed the MDGs, is in the \nmaking. Albania has been an active participant in \nthe global consultations focused on making the \npeople\u2019s voices part of the formulation of the post-\n2015 development agenda. Albania has agreed to test a \nproposed development goal on governance and the rule \nof law designed to help countries achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. We hope our experience in monitoring \ngovernance, the rule of law and effective, capable \ninstitutions will help to inform the upcoming post-2015 \nagenda of the United Nations.\n\nTerrorism remains a major threat to international \npeace and security, and the fight against terrorism is \na priority that requires a greater commitment. We are \naware that this global threat can be countered only with \ncollective action and a powerful response. Albania \ncondemns in the strongest terms all terrorist attacks \nby terrorist groups and organizations in Iraq and Syria, \nincluding and especially by the Islamic State in Iraq and \nthe Levant (ISIL). Conscious that terrorism is a threat \nwithout borders, a threat to human values and principles \nas well as to individual countries and regions, Albania \nhas joined the recently created international coalition \naimed at deterring and eventually defeating ISIL.\n\nEuropean integration and cooperation in our \nregion, and the geopolitical and security situation in \nEurope, have changed significantly in recent months. \nThe Western Balkans, of which my country is part, is \nan important geo-strategic European region and one \nthat recently committed fully to a path of increased \npolitical stability, economic progress and sustainable \ndevelopment, with strengthened cooperation, security \ncharacterized by good relations with its neighbours, \nand peace consolidation. The European route is the best \nguarantee for achieving these objectives in our region.\n\nWe are committed to resolving various bilateral \nissues as soon as possible, in the interests of our people \nand our neighbourly relations. We are fully aware \nthat we must enact a number of measures to eradicate \ncorruption and organized crime. Like every country \nin the region, we have expressed our willingness \nto conduct joint reforms that will bring increased \neconomic stability and prosperity for our citizens and \nthat will open markets and attract foreign investment.\n\nThe Republic of Kosovo is one of the members of \nour Western Balkan community, the youngest State \nin the region. In less than six years as an independent \nState, Kosovo has managed, through a transformative \ndevelopment agenda, to enjoy wide, uninterrupted \ninternational recognition and to successfully integrate \ninto international, regional and global organizations, \nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary \nFund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, the European Bank for Development, \nthe Venice Commission, the South-East European \nCooperation Process and others. Kosovo has become an \nimportant factor for peace and stability in the region, \nand Albania fully supports its overall development, as \nwell as its stability and territorial integrity within its \ncurrent borders.\n\nKosovo\u2019s progress, the new atmosphere in the \nregion, and the need for the region as a whole to move \ntowards more cooperation and prosperity have led \ndown the path to successful European Union-sponsored \ntalks between Kosovo and Serbia as two equal partners \nin seeking concrete solutions to technical issues of \nimportance to their citizens. Time has shown that \nengaging in dialogue was a wise decision. Dialogue has \nproduced concrete results, brought the two countries \ncloser to each other, and facilitated and sped up the \nEuropean Union integration path for both States. \nAlbania fully supports the process of dialogue and calls \nfor the full implementation of the agreements reached.\n\nTo date, Kosovo has been recognized by 108 States \nMembers of the United Nations, representing more than \nhalf of the United Nations membership. Recognition \nhas without doubt been an important factor in Kosovo\u2019s \nprogress. That is why, as before, we call on the countries \nthat have not yet recognized Kosovo to do so, since in \nso doing they would not only help the people of Kosovo \nadvance towards their future but also contribute to \npeace and stability in the region.\n\n\nWe remain convinced that the quick and full \nimplementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement \nrepresents a condition indispensable to the sustainable \nstability of Macedonia, to the consolidation of \ndemocracy and the rule of law, and to fulfilling and \nrealizing the rights of Albanians. Albania encourages \nthe continuation of dialogue between the Belgrade \nauthorities and the Albanians of the Presheva valley to \n\n\npromote their rights in accordance with international \nstandards, focusing especially on solving economic, \nsocial, educational and cultural problems.\n\nDuring the past two decades, Albania has been \ntransformed from a totalitarian State into a functioning \ndemocracy. Progress is evident, above all, in the field \nof human rights. The protection and promotion of \nhuman rights are one of the national priorities and \npart of Albania\u2019s foreign policy. Albania offers a \nvaluable model of respect for diversity, tolerance and \ncoexistence for the Balkan region and beyond. For the \nAlbanian people, tolerance and hospitality are inherent \nvalues derived from our national tradition.\n\nThe presentation of Albania\u2019s candidacy for \nmembership on the Human Rights Council for the \n2015-2017 term is only a logical consequence of \nour road towards building a society based on human \nrights. We are confident that Albania has accumulated \nvaluable experience in democracy over the years that \nit can share with other member countries of the United \nNations. Moreover, by reaffirming the universality, \nindivisibility and interdependence of human rights, \nAlbania is committed to bringing a national and \nregional perspective into the Council\u2019s deliberations \nand advocacy of human rights worldwide.\n\nWe are aware that our membership in the Council \nfor the 2015-2017 term is a challenge bearing great \nresponsibility to justify the confidence of Member \nStates. On the other hand, Human Rights Council \nmembership would serve as an impetus for my country \nto further democratization and to raise human rights \nstandards. Therefore, Albania, after obtaining the \nendorsement of the group of Eastern European States, \nwould welcome and appreciate the support of all other \nMember States for its candidacy to the Council.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate Albania\u2019s \ndetermination to continue its support of the United \nNations agenda and strengthening the role of the United \nNations globally.\n"

I convey \nthe congratulations and best wishes of His Majesty the \nKing and the people of the Kingdom of eSwatini to the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession, a son of Africa. We commend the Secretary-\nGeneral and his staff for the good work they are doing \nin creating an enabling environment for all humankind \nto live in peace despite the multiple challenges facing \nthe world.\n\nAs we gather here, we are very mindful of the \nnew challenge that confronts the global community \nfollowing the outbreak of Ebola in some parts of the \nAfrican continent. That disease is claiming hundreds of \nlives and diverting focus and resources from essential \ndevelopment initiatives. It is also a serious drawback \nto the attainment of the Millennium Development \nGoals and is a threat to humankind. We urge the United \nNations and its Members to spare no effort in providing \nall the necessary assistance at its disposal to curb the \ndisease and prevent any further loss of life.\n\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to thank the \nGeneral Assembly for convening the high-level plenary \nmeeting known as the World Conference on Indigenous \nPeoples. It was particularly opportune, as indigenous \nknowledge and practices substantially contribute to the \nsustainable development agenda.\n\nLast week the General Assembly held its twenty-\nninth special session, on follow-up to the Programme \nof Action of the International Conference on Population \nand Development beyond 2014. My delegation was \npleased to participate in that event. We reaffirm the \nKingdom\u2019s commitment to the Programme of Action, \nwhich is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago.\n\nThis year the regular session of the General \nAssembly was preceded by the Climate Summit, at \nwhich Heads of State and Government deliberated on \nissues of environmental protection. Those issues are \ncritical to the achievement of sustainable development, \nparticularly for the developing countries. We are \npleased that the Summit was able to mobilize sufficient \npolitical support for guiding the Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, to be held in Lima in December. \nThe issue of climate change is crucial for many of our \ndeveloping economies, especially on the continent of \nAfrica. It has a direct effect on our national objective to \nproduce enough food for ourselves. The unpredictable \nweather conditions continue to be of great concern to \nour farmers. We shall continue to call upon the United \nNations to expedite the issue to prevent further adverse \neffects on our lives.\n\nThe theme of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session is \u201cDelivering on and implementing \na transformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d. It \nresonates well with our call for a development agenda \nthat is inclusive. It is a clear indication that we are \ntranscending the era of the Millennium Development \nGoals, entering a new chapter of the development \nagenda. As we set the stage for the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, my delegation is heartened to see \nthat we have not forgotten our collective inability to \nmeet all the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nI commend the co-Chairs of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals for the \nmanner in which they ably guided the proceedings of \nthe Group. We welcome the outcome document of the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals (A/68/970) and the goals and targets contained \ntherein. The Kingdom of eSwatini is pleased that the \nframework for the post-2015 development agenda has \ntaken into account those Millennium Development \nGoals that have not yet been met, especially the \neradication of poverty. As we begin a new era, let \nus not forget our previous commitments, and let us \ncontinue to emphasize the urgency for the developed \npartners to honour their official development assistance \ncommitments.\n\nFood security remains a critical challenge for the \nAfrican continent, and we wish to reiterate our call \nfor the provision of adequate financial resources, the \ntransfer of environmentally sound technologies and \ntechnical assistance to developing countries if we are \nto achieve our development goals. We have abundant \nresources on the continent. However, there is a great \nneed for value addition to our products in order to \nmaximize our food-production initiatives.\n\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini continues to set aside \na sizeable budget for agriculture. Due to the negative \neffects of climate change, we have a programme to \nconstruct dams for irrigation throughout the Kingdom. \nAssistance to subsistence farmers with farming inputs \nhas also been increased with the intention of increasing \ntheir yields and thus increasing food production in the \nKingdom.\n\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini fully supports the \nAfrican Union\u2019s road map for development, Agenda \n2063, which is critical to attaining the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We are confident that, with United \nNations support, that approach will accelerate Africa\u2019s \nregional economic integration agenda and help realize \nit, facilitate integration in the world economy and \nultimately improve the continent\u2019s living standards.\n\nAfrica is home to the majority of the world\u2019s fastest-\ngrowing economies, and trade remains an integral \npart of the development agenda. Focus is now on \n\nsustaining that growth through boosting intra-African \ntrade and establishing the continental free trade area. \nIt is important, however, that access to the global \nmarkets remain open to mutually beneficial conditions \nthat promote the United Nations ideals of increased \ninternational cooperation and trade.\n\nWe are encouraged by the renewed commitment for \nthe economic development of the African continent as \nresolved in different summits. The continent abounds \nwith investment opportunities in different sectors, \nsuch as infrastructure, information, communication, \ntechnology and energy, to name but a few. That will, \nno doubt, have a huge impact on the sustainable \ndevelopment programmes for the continent. It will also \ncontribute handsomely to job creation, particularly for \nthe youth.\n\nWe should ensure that the post-2015 agenda is \ncognizant of the special development needs of developing \ncountries, particularly those in Africa. We also give \nparticular recognition to those developing countries \nthat have special challenges due to their geographical \nposition, such as small island developing States and \nlandlocked developing countries. My delegation hopes \nthat the agenda will also take into consideration the \nspecial plight of middle-income countries, where the \nmajority of the world\u2019s poor reside.\n\nThe Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini is \npleased to note that the Republic of China on Taiwan \ncontinues to contribute to global issues, and the \npositive developments taking place in that region are \nencouraging. We encourage their full participation in \nall United Nations structures.\n\nAs we meet here, in some parts of the world people \nare living in fear as every day thousands of human \nbeings, especially vulnerable groups, are losing their \nlives to terrorists. We encourage the United Nations to \ntake a leading role in promoting peace and coexistence \nin the world. We call on all those who are fighting \nto find a lasting, peaceful solution to their problems \nthrough dialogue and not through the barrel of a gun.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kingdom of eSwatini would like \nto commend the United Nations and related agencies \nfor being a key factor in helping to overcome the \nmany complex challenges facing the world today. We \nreiterate our call for peaceful solutions and dialogue \nin all conflict situations so that the United Nations \nmay achieve its noble objectives. We take pride in and \nreaffirm our commitment to the principles and ideals \ncontained in the Charter of the United Nations. May the \nAlmighty God bless us all.\n"

I would also like to express my thanks and \nappreciation to Mr. John Ashe and his team, as well as \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nIn this world, where a surfeit of bad news \novershadows the good work of creativity, reform \nand recovery, we continue our peaceful transition to \ndemocracy. We have managed to eliminate a dictatorial \nregime at the least possible human cost. We have begun \na difficult transitional stage with a comprehensive \nnational dialogue, and we have written a consensual \nconstitution and built democratic State institutions. \nWe are now preparing for legislative and presidential \nelections to be held before the end of the year in order \nto transform Tunisia into a stable, democratic, forward-\nlooking State. Internal and external forces continue to \nundermine our democratic, peaceful transition through \nterrorist acts and political assassinations. However, our \npeople are resolved to pursue their efforts to achieve \nsuccess, despite the aggression of diabolical forces.\n\nTunisia today is a test for a peaceful democratic \ntransition in an Arab country that lived for too long under \ndespotism. We are attempting to reconcile democracy \nand political Islam. We are pursuing an ongoing national \ndialogue. We are distributing authority between secular \nmodernists and Islamists. We are using moderation to \ngrapple with the counter-revolution and to eliminate \nthe residues of despotism through a just transition. We \nare also testing new socioeconomic approaches. We are \npromoting comprehensive development initiatives that \nwill combat poverty and that will be in harmony with \nthe environment. We have a broader social vision in line \nwith the policies and vision of the United Nations with \nregard to addressing global warming, climate change \nand the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, as \nwell as the Secretary-General\u2019s Global Education First \nInitiative. We are also committed to our own policies \nthat aim to achieve world peace, especially within the \nArab world to which we belong, and on the African \ncontinent, where we seek to definitively overcome the \npast and look to the future.\n\nTunisia\u2019s development process is unfolding in the \nheart of a region that is currently witnessing political \nupheavals that, in some cases, have had painful \nconsequences for us too. Transnational radical armed \ngroups have since the beginning of the revolution been \ntargeting us and have killed many of our soldiers and \nsecurity personnel, hindering our security apparatus \nin an attempt to abort the drive for democracy and \nto impose alternatives rejected by the majority of our \npeople.\n\nThe volatile situation in Libya is cause for concern \nbecause the stability of that sister neighbouring \ncountry affects our own stability. We hope that the \nLibyans will, through national dialogue, achieve an \nadvanced, democratic stable State without outside \nmilitary intervention, which would only add insult \nto injury. We encourage the wise men of Libya, both \nwithin and outside that country, to preserve broad \nnational consensus and the security, unity, stability and \nprosperity of their country through a peaceful, political \nsolution. We hope from the bottom of our hearts that \nour brothers will manage to achieve that.\n\nWe are concerned by the spread of violence \non the eastern front of the Arab world, which has \nreached unprecedented levels of brutality, including \ndecapitation, the chopping off of hands and the \nexecution of prisoners. We are appalled by such \nviolence and attacks on our Christian brothers and \nother religious minorities, who form an integral part \nof our Arab and Islamic heritage and culture. We are \nashamed of such practices in the name of our Allah, \nwho defines himself as the compassionate and the \nmerciful. According to the Koran, whoever kills an \ninnocent soul kills all humankind, and whoever gives a \nnew life to such a person saves all humankind. That has \n\n\nhappened all too frequently of late. Nothing can justify \nthe indiscriminate violence at such unprecedented and \nhorrific levels. We condemn the execution of prisoners, \nbe they Arab, Muslim, French, American or British. We \nare all human beings and belong to one human family. \nWe seek to understand this phenomenon so as to be able \nto address its root causes.\n\nThe violence and counter-violence we are \nwitnessing today are the cumulative result of five \ndecades of misguided policies of despotism that denied \npeople their rights and basic freedoms, distributed \nwealth to some and consigned others to poverty. Such \npolicies, which have exploited religion in the service \nof politics, are like magic that has now turned against \nthe magician. They run counter to Arab and Islamic \ncivilization. The problem cannot be solved by entrusting \nit to the police and army. The situation demands bold \npolicies that take into account all those levels and that \nestablishes regimes that are in harmony with their \npeople. All political prisoners should be released and \nthere should be an ongoing national dialogue with the \nparticipation of all moderate political sectors that are \ncommitted to peace. The economy needs to serve the \ninterests of the majority, with an emphasis on advanced \neducation under the banner of freedom and respect for \nthe values of the Arab and Muslim countries. Only such \npolicies will lead to united, peace-abiding societies. \nOur people yearn to improve their standard of living \nand to broaden the vistas for future generations.\n\nFor many decades, some of the major Powers \nsupported despotic regimes in our country on the \npretext of maintaining stability. If the same problems \nare not to be repeated, they must help to achieve internal \nreconciliation. Resorting to military solutions may lead \nto meaningless wars that could endanger the whole \nworld. We therefore strongly call for the blockade of \nGaza to be lifted in order to enable it to build a port and \nairport, and not just to open the border crossings but also \nto fulfil the political right of the Palestinian people to a \ngeographically contiguous, secure, independent State, \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. The Gazans who are \nliving without shelter are pleading to our consciences \nfor the reconstruction of Gaza and return children to \ntheir destroyed schools\u2019 classrooms and playgrounds. \nWe pray to God to end the nightmare engulfing the \npeople of Syria through the banishment of its dictator \nand the formation of a Government of national unity.\n\nTunisia, as a Member of the United Nations, \nunderstands how important it is that the Organization \nbe capable of dealing with such huge global changes. \nWe support the granting of permanent membership in \nthe Security Council to Brazil, Germany, Japan and \nIndia, to be followed by permanent-member status for \nan African country, to enable it to deal with the world \nof today, which is no longer that which existed at the \nend of the Second World War. That war ended with \nthe defeat of fascism, dictatorship and Nazism and, \neventually, Communist totalitarianism. While so much \nof today\u2019s world has been democratizing so rapidly, it \nis now threatened with climate, economic and political \nproblems. To deal with them, every country must \npreserve its gains and create the machinery needed for \nprevention, protection and commitment.\n\nIt is good that we have the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC) for punishing despots who abuse their \npeoples\u2019 rights; we should also have a tool that prevents \nthem from surviving and staying in power. Tunisia \nhas therefore proposed establishing an international \nconstitutional court that could advise all liberated \npeoples and hand down decisions on illegitimate, \nbogus elections that lead to Government by force, \nwhich clearly runs contrary to international legitimacy \nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This \nidea has been well received in academic circles and \ninternational symposiums. We reiterate our call for \nsupport for such democratic institutions so that this \nproposal can be presented to the Legal Committee.\n\nWe hope that an international court such as this can \nbe realized and could enable us to deter despots, support \nfreedom and democracy and eradicate the sources \nof violence and conflicts among peoples. I hope that \nestablishing such a court will not require the decades \nthat it took to bring about the birth of the ICC, and we \nhope that Tunis, our capital, can have the honour of \nhosting one of the United Nations institutions that have \nso far been the preserve of the advanced countries of \nthe northern hemisphere. It is high time to give some \nthought to allowing the liberated cities of the South to \nhost such institutions.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nMr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency \n\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \nLet me assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support and \ncooperation as he steers our work during this session. I \nmust also commend his predecessor, Ambassador John \nAshe, for showing such capable leadership during the \nprevious session. He led the small island developing \nStates (SIDS) through several important milestones \nduring his tenure, including the International Year \nof Small Island Developing States and the recently \nconcluded International Conference on SIDS in Samoa.\n\nIt has been said that the stars are aligned with SIDS \nthis year. Ambassador Ashe has been our brightest \nbeacon, and I thank him very much for that. Let me \nalso thank another champion of the SIDS, Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. Indeed, earlier this year, I \nsat in the Trusteeship Council Chamber when the \nSecretary-General helped us celebrate the launch of the \nInternational Year of Small Island Developing States. \nShowing a remarkable understanding of our unique \ncircumstances, he said:\n\n\u201cThe International Year offers us the \nopportunity to celebrate the rich cultural heritage \nof the people of small island developing States and \nto honour their many contributions to our world. \nIt is also an opportunity to highlight the various \nneeds and challenges of this diverse coalition. \nSome small island developing States have enjoyed \nlong-lasting stability. Others are in transition. Some \nare economically more fragile than others... Others \nare extremely vulnerable to the immediate effects \nof climate change. But all small island developing \nStates share a common understanding. We need to \nset our world on a sustainable path.\u201d\nThe challenges of SIDS are many. One need only \nglance at the headlines to appreciate that they join a \nlong list of concerns that the international community \nmust confront today: naked brutality, pestilence, \npoverty and the worsening impacts of climate change, \nto name only a few. I understand the impulse for us to \nput off hard decisions to another day, prioritize some \nover others, or even bury our heads in the sand. But \nthe General Assembly is and remains the pre-eminent \nforum for grappling with global crises, and the United \nNations is our best hope for solving them.\n\nHowever, if we are to be successful, we must \nacknowledge a reality that lies beneath so many of those \nchallenges, namely, that we live in an interconnected \nworld and that the actions of one country or region \nimpact the lives of people half a world away. Conflict, \npoverty and disease can send refugees across borders \nand oceans and sometimes all the way to our shores. \nWe can no longer escape each other. As the Secretary-\nGeneral also remarked, we all share the same island.\n\nAlso, we must consider my country\u2019s connection \nto the ocean. As for so many SIDS, the ocean is the \nfoundation of our culture and economy, and we depend \non its bounty for food and income. Yet the reckless \nactions of other nations have severely undermined the \nmarine environment on which we so depend \u2014 from \nexcessive greenhouse gas emissions that warm the \nplanet and make the seas more and more acidic to \nirresponsible overfishing, the outright stealing of fish \nin our waters, and dangerous pollution, the effect of \nwhich we have yet to fully comprehend.\n\nAll the while, some of those same countries \nresponsible for the damage are also charged with \nassessing the well-being of the marine environment. \nHow can we be confident that our interests will be \nprotected in that effort? We, as a developing country, \nare constantly facing demands for greater transparency \nand accountability from the same actors that downplay, \nand sometimes even cover up, their own transgressions.\n\nFinding lasting solutions to problems such as \nthose will require more resources and a level of \ncooperation that the international community has \nso far not countenanced. It will also require us to \nlook at the failings in the global order that somehow \nprevent countries such as mine from accessing the fair \neconomic benefits of our own resources. Nevertheless, \nwe cannot just stand by and do nothing. We cannot and \nshould not wait for others to decide what is best for us. \nFor that reason, the parties to the Nauru Agreement \nare taking the lead in successfully managing their tuna \nstocks through such measures as curbing illegal fishing \nand sustainable harvesting.\n\nThe President has wisely chosen \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d as the theme of the general debate of the \nsixty-ninth session. It goes to the heart of the central \ntask before us \u2014 not only fulfilling the long-standing \npromises with regard to sustainable development but \nalso engendering a paradigm shift in the way that we \nachieve such development. The current piecemeal \napproach, where a donor\u2019s political interests determine \naid priorities, may treat symptoms for a time, but it fails \nto address the underlying disease.\n\n\nIf we want our efforts to be successful over the \nlong term, we need to build a foundation that develops \nglobal citizens and gives them the tools they need to \nsucceed in a global world. In other words, we must \nmove beyond capacity-building to institution-building. \nWhat is needed is long-term in-country engagement, \nbacked by real resources, that produces durable \ndomestic institutions run by nationals. We cannot let \nnew and emerging issues distract or diminish work on \ncore priorities that remain inadequately addressed. We \nmay be experiencing our own fatigue when we again \nraise the issues of overfishing, climate adaptation and \nwater treatment, but those are often the areas most in \nneed of attention.\n\nI know that tackling all of those problems will be a \ntall order and may seem quite daunting, I am absolutely \nconfident that this institution and its agencies are up \nto the task. We have made some progress in reducing \nhunger, poverty and disease. And just this week, the \nworld watched as leaders gathered at the Climate \nSummit to announce the actions that their countries and \ncorporations are planning in order to lower greenhouse \ngas emissions responsible for the climate crisis. The \nSummit provided hope that, at least in some corners, \nserious climate action is imminent. However, it was \nhard to ignore the fact that most announcements were \nabout the greenhouse gas reductions that would occur \nunder some future Government a decade or more in the \nfuture.\n\nWhat is more, SIDS, which contribute only a \nfraction of global emissions, have undertaken to build \nsustainable economies while announcing some of the \nmost ambitious pledges to cut emissions. For example, \nwe are working closely with the International Renewable \nEnergy Agency, through their Lighthouses initiative, \nto achieve our own goal of a 50 per cent reduction \nin 2020. My own regional group, the Pacific SIDS, \nled the General Assembly to formally recognize the \nconnection between climate change and international \npeace and security in 2009 and helped convince the \nSecurity Council to do the same in 2011.\n\nBut, while few countries doubt the correlation \nbetween climate change and conflict today and despite \ngraphic examples of such in the past few years alone, \nthere is still disagreement as to the way forward. \nTherefore, we are still of the opinion that the Secretary-\nGeneral should appoint a special representative on \nclimate and security to analyse the projected security \nimpacts of the crisis. In addition, the Secretary-General \nshould lead a joint task force of all relevant organs \nand specialized agencies to assess the capacity of the \nUnited Nations system to respond. That is the least we \ncan do as an international body to prepare for one of the \nbiggest challenges of our generation.\n\nIf the Security Council is to remain relevant, it \nmust be adaptive enough to meet the latest threats, and \nclimate change is a clear and present danger that we \nignore at our own peril. The Security Council must also \nreflect new geopolitical realities by becoming more \nrepresentative and inclusive. It is for that reason that \nNauru supports the reform of the Security Council by \nenlarging its permanent and non-permanent categories \nand making its working methods more efficient. New \nmembers should be more geographically diverse, \nbut they must also be willing to broaden their vision \nbeyond a narrow focus on domestic interests to include \na commitment to the common good of all Member \nStates.\n\nSimilarly, the United Nations should ensure that all \ncitizens of the world have the opportunity to participate \nin its activities. It must work for the 10,000 people in \nNauru and other small countries, and it must not continue \nto ignore the 24 million people in Taiwan, who time \nand again have demonstrated a commitment to peace \nand regional cooperation. Nauru is pleased to note that, \nwith solid international support and the cross-Strait \nrapprochement, the Republic of China has increased its \nmeaningful participation in United Nations specialized \nagencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage \nthe positive interaction between the two sides of the \nTaiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore, \nI would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan \nhas made to help my country make progress towards \nits national sustainable development strategy. I take \nthe opportunity to also express my country\u2019s deep \nappreciation to our friends and partners who continue \nto support our sustainable development priorities, \nincluding Australia, Russia, New Zealand, the European \nUnion, Cuba, Israel and Turkey, to mention a few.\n\nThe world is rapidly changing, and the new realities \nhave strained the ability of the United Nations to \nrespond adequately. Long-term solutions will require \na new commitment to providing adequate means of \nimplementation. On climate change alone, we are far \nfrom the goal of providing $100 billion a year by 2020 \nto help nations adapt to climate impacts that are now \nunavoidable and to build sources of clean energy, to say \n\n\nnothing of the 0.7 per cent gross domestic product goal \nfor development aid.\n\nI know that we, as an international community, face \nnumerous crises on many fronts and that much is being \nasked of us. But I strongly believe that it is in times \nlike these that solutions to even the most intractable \nproblems emerge from the human spirit. It is in times \nlike these that light emerges from darkness; hope from \ndespair.\n\nThe small island developing States have laid out a \nvision to help us reach our full potential. I invite our \npartners to invest in our peoples, and we will build \na better and more secure world. The United Nations \nremains our best hope for people everywhere to live \nin peace and prosperity. My faith in it has never been \nstronger. God bless the Republic of Nauru and God \nbless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "The leaders who gathered \nat the United Nations Climate Summit have taken \nimportant steps to mobilize action and ambition on \nclimate change. Now we need to make sure that the \npositive results are followed through and expanded as \nwe prepare for an agreement in Paris next year.\n\nWhen we meet at the General Assembly next year, \nwe will adopt the new set of global goals for our common \nfuture \u2014 the sustainable development goals (SDGs). \nThey must build on the success of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). They must be realistic \nand ambitious. Like the MDGs, the SDGs should be \nfew in number, concrete and measurable. Meanwhile, \nachieving the eight Millennium Development Goals will \ncreate a solid foundation for sustainable development. \nAs co-chair of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s MDG \nAdvocacy Group, I will use every opportunity to help \nbuild that foundation over the remaining 462 days until \nthe deadline.\n\nWe must accelerate our efforts, and to do so we \nneed to enter into broad partnerships that include the \nprivate sector, civil society and Governments. We need \nto make use of the best possible innovative solutions \nand technologies. Governments and national political \nleaders must take the lead and ensure local ownership. \nAt the same time, we must support the remarkable work \nthat many people are doing to implement the MDGs in \npractice.\n\nThe frightening Ebola epidemic in West Africa \nreminds us of the fragility of our progress and \ndevelopment. We must build health-care systems that \ncan support courageous and determined individuals \nlike Josephine Finda Sellu. Ms. Sellu, the deputy nurse \nmatron at a Government hospital in Sierra Leone, lost \n15 of her nurses to Ebola. Nevertheless, she never \nstopped working in that death trap. She is a true fighter \nfor the MDGs.\n\nEducation, particularly for girls, is the superhighway \nto ending poverty. Poverty, discrimination and the use \nof force often prevent girls from getting the education \nthey are entitled to. Sexual violence, abductions and \ndeadly attacks are the most despicable ways in which \ngirls\u2019 right to education is being violated. I condemn \nthe abductions of schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the \nstrongest possible terms. In the face of terrorists \nthreatening to deprive children of their right to \neducation, we should be inspired by Malala Yousafzai. \nMalala brought to light the plight of the millions of \nchildren around the world who are denied an education. \nIf one schoolgirl can take on the Taliban, then surely the \nworld community can defeat extremism and terrorism.\n\nTerrorists and extremists are trying to stop us \nfrom educating children. Peace is vital for achieving \nuniversal primary education. The same can be said \nfor the other MDGs, not least the goal on reducing \npoverty. That is why we must focus on conflict-affected \ncountries. A girl growing up in Syria today cannot look \nforward to going to school, because there is no school \nto go to. A pregnant teenage girl in South Sudan will \nnot get the maternal health services she needs because \nit is too risky for health workers to travel. From the \nSecurity Council Chamber to the modest homes in the \nSwat Valley in Pakistan, we can all help to end poverty \nby promoting peace, but all those different efforts at the \nglobal, regional, national and local levels must work in \nconcert.\n\n\nIt has been 70 years since a group of leaders met \nin Washington, D. C., to discuss the creation of the \nUnited Nations. One of the most fundamental tenets \nof the new world order created in 1945 was respect \nfor internationally recognized borders. Norway \ncondemns Russia\u2019s violations of international law and \nits continuing destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Any \nsettlement of the conflict must uphold international law \nand respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The \nceasefire agreed on 5 September must be respected and \nthe provisions of the agreement implemented on the \nground. Russia bears a particular responsibility in that \nregard.\n\nThe Security Council is mandated to maintain peace \nand security, but has failed to address the situation in \nSyria and Ukraine effectively. We know why. Some of \nthe big Powers still believe in outdated ideas of zero-\nsum games and spheres of influence. We are hopeful \nthat the Council will continue to stand united against \nthe threat of the terrorist group known as the Islamic \nState in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We support the \nUnited States initiative and sponsored Security Council \nresolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters. We \nencourage the countries of the region to take a leading \nrole in fighting ISIL.\n\nArmed conflict and civil war have created man-\nmade humanitarian disasters in Syria, Iraq, South \nSudan, the Central African Republic and Somalia. \nEarlier this year, Norway hosted a humanitarian donor \nconference for South Sudan, and we will shortly \nco-host a donor conference to address the aftermath of \nthe conflict in Gaza. Donor conferences are important, \nbut we need to look beyond the emergencies. We need \nto build on and improve the current system, when we \nmeet for the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016. We \nmust make sure that humanitarian aid supports not only \nshort-term recovery, but also long-term development. \nBesides, long-term development cooperation should \nhelp countries prevent, prepare for, withstand and \nrecover from humanitarian crises in the future.\n\nInternational peace, national security, social \ndevelopment and individual prosperity can best be \nfostered under a system of good democratic governance \nand human rights. Efforts to promote respect for \nhuman rights can help prevent armed conflict and mass \natrocities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, \nherself a leading human rights defender, stated in her \nNobel lecture that:\n\n\u201c[i]f the twenty-first century wishes to free itself \nfrom the cycle of violence, acts of terror and war, \nthere is no other way except by understanding \nand putting into practice every human right for \nall mankind, irrespective of race, gender, faith, \nnationality or social status.\u201d\nI agree with that.\n\nHuman rights is one of the three pillars of the \nUnited Nations, based on the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights, adopted by the Assembly on \n10 December 1948. Norway endorses the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s \u201cHuman Rights Up Front\u201d initiative, which \nplaces the protection of human rights at the heart of \nUnited Nations strategies and operational activities. \nThe United Nations needs a strong and assertive human \nrights pillar. Only if we fund the human rights pillar \nproperly can we achieve the results that we need and \nwant from our world Organization.\n\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is \nfirst and foremost the responsibility of States. We are, \nhowever, facing large implementation gaps. Attacks, \nthreats, intimidation and reprisals against human \nrights defenders are increasingly being reported. New \nlaws restricting freedom of expression and the work \nof civil society are being adopted. Discrimination \nis widespread, particularly against minorities, such \nas indigenous people and lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntransgender persons.\n\nThe rule of law and civil liberties are also \nfundamental to the development of the private sector \nand attracting investment. Moreover, we know that \nenabling women to fully enjoy their social and economic \nrights unleashes tremendous economic growth.\n\nWe must stay focused on accelerating progress \ntowards the MDGs during the remaining 462 days. We \nmust let ourselves be inspired by those who serve at \nthe front line of those efforts, like Ms. Sellu and other \ndoctors and nurses who are risking their lives to treat \npatients with Ebola.\n\nAs we set our future development agenda beyond \n2015, we must also make some adjustments. Peace \nand stability must be included. Climate issues must be \naddressed. Good, democratic governance, with respect \nfor the rule of law and human rights, will be crucial for \nachieving sustainable development for us all. And all \nthat means, quite simply, is to be doing the right things \nright.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by conveying \nthe warm greetings of His Majesty the King of Bhutan. \nIt is an honour for me to be present in this grand \nassembly of nations. Great men and women of our time \nhave graced this rostrum. Yet the magnitude of the \nchallenges we are called on to address today remains \nformidable \u2014 greater than any person or any country \nwe represent.\n\nThe United Nations was founded to unlock the \npotential of our collective endeavour to promote the \npeace, prosperity and progress of succeeding generations \nof humankind. As we approach the seventieth \nanniversary of the founding of our Organization, \nthe considerable gains we have made on the social, \neconomic and political fronts give us many reasons to \nbe hopeful. However, we continue to be confronted by \ngrave challenges. They include the festering wounds of \nage-old conflicts that threaten to spin out of control; \nnew tensions and the resurgence of violent extremism; \nthe irrefutable evidence of the menace posed by climate \nchange to life on our planet; and the unconscionable \ninequities and injustices that contribute to the fact that \nmillions are deprived of such basic needs as food and \nshelter. All of these are compelling issues that remind \nus that we have yet to heed the tragic lessons of the past, \nand that we are far from realizing the world envisaged \nin the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nWe commend the President for his choice of \nthe theme for this session, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d. This is an opportune moment to redefine a \nnew era in international development and cooperation, \none that can build on the successes and shortcomings \nof more than three decades of internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, and the Millennium Development \nGoals in particular. The process must activate real and \nmeaningful change for all countries if it is indeed to \nbe transformative. For this to happen, the agenda must \nbe anchored to the need for breakthroughs to address \nthe hard realities on the ground in individual countries, \nespecially with regard to capacity and financing for \ndevelopment.\n\nAccordingly, a collaborative approach, based \non an appreciation of the unique circumstances and \nexperience of each country and driven by the desire for \ntrue working partnerships among and within countries, \nwill be vital. Such an approach would require changes \nin our development paradigm, in our beliefs regarding \nthe sustainability of the world\u2019s current trajectory, \nand in our behaviour as individuals, which shape our \nnational character and our destiny as an international \ncommunity of nations.\n\nA small, least developed, landlocked country like \nmine, with many less-than-ideal indicators, has to get \nits development priorities right. Given our small size \nand unique circumstances, the lessons Bhutan has \nlearned are not universal, but certain principles may \nhave relevance. It is in a spirit of humility and modesty \nthat we share our experience and aspirations.\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that development \nmust be guided by a clear, home-grown vision. Ours, \nchampioned by successive monarchs, identifies people\u2019s \nwelfare and happiness as its central objective. Secondly, \nit takes good governance to unlock the full potential \nof a country and its people in the pursuit of effective \ndevelopment and peace. Thirdly, within the broader \ndevelopment objective, the eradication of poverty must \nremain an overarching aim. Eliminating the scourge of \npoverty must therefore form the central purpose of the \npost-2015 development agenda.\n\nFourthly, strong partnerships are the key to \ndelivering on the post-2015 development agenda. In \nour experience, nurturing and maintaining strong \n\npartnerships with our donors, based on trust and mutual \nrespect, has been critical to our progress. Last but not \nleast, there is the conservation of the environment, \nwhich is related to the issue of sustainability. A \ndecent standard of living, with adequate education, \nhealth care and employment, is essential for people \nto live with self-respect, dignity and hope. But if the \nmost basic necessities of life, air, water and food are \npolluted and contaminated, a decent standard of living \nis unsustainable. The wanton exploitation of natural \nresources, without any care for the health of our planet, \nclearly cannot go on.\n\nIn a world riven by challenges of epic proportions, \nthe centrality of the United Nations as the only truly \nglobal organization cannot be overemphasized. Yet \nefforts to reform its highest organ, the Security Council, \nremain deadlocked. While a consensus-based decision \nis the most desirable way forward in multilateralism, \nwe cannot allow its absence to obstruct progress \nindefinitely, especially in the crucial area of peace and \nsecurity.\n\nWe are heading into a momentous year during \nwhich the international community will craft a new \ndevelopment agenda that will lay the framework for \ntransformational change and shared prosperity. In the \nfinal analysis, no matter what brilliant concepts we \nintroduce and breakthroughs we achieve on paper, \nnothing of lasting value can be achieved without a \ntransformation of mindsets and hearts. It is there, \nperhaps, in our hearts and minds that we really need a \nparadigm shift.\n\nIn the words of His Majesty the King of Bhutan:\n\n\u201cThis is a world that is shared, not between \nGovernments and nations but among the peoples. \nNo nation today can stand alone in achievement. \nThere can be no lasting national progress if it does \nnot fit into a future of global peace, harmony and \nprosperity. The world must progress together or fail \ntogether.\u201d\n"

I would also like to \nthank your predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for his efforts.\n\nMany events and significant changes have taken \nplace since I stood here last year (see A/68/PV.21). Those \nevents have surprised many of the countries represented \nhere today, but they did not surprise us, since we have \nbeen warning the international community about \ntrends leading towards the current situation for the past \nthree and a half years. Speeches from this rostrum have \nfocused on the economic and political crises that we \nhave been waiting for the international community to \nresolve. However, talking about such issues is no longer \na priority.\n\nWhat we have been witnessing for a few months is \nmuch more dangerous than all the political and economic \ncrises that have been happening in the world. More than \nonce and from more than one international platform, we \nhave talked about the grave threat of terrorism that is \nstriking Syria. We said that such terrorism would not be \nlimited to the territory of my country, since terrorism \nhas no boundaries.

Today we are witnessing \nwhat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the \nmost dangerous terrorist organization in the entire world \nin terms of its unprecedented funding and brutality, is \ndoing to Syrians and Iraqis of all stripes and religions. \nThat terrorist organization is enslaving women, raping \nthem and selling them in slave markets. It decapitates \nand cuts off limbs, teaches children to slaughter and \nmurder and destroys historical and cultural monuments, \nas well as Islamic and Christian symbols.\n\nAll that is happening before the eyes of the entire \nworld and countries that have vowed always to fight \nterrorism, even though they themselves have not \nexperienced the scourge of terror. Today I stand here \nto ask the following. Is it not time for all of us to stand \n\n\nunited in the face of the serious threat of terrorist takfiri \nideology worldwide? Has the time not come for all of us \nto admit that ISIL, the Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida \naffiliates will not remain within the borders of Syria and \nIraq but will spread to every place that they can reach, \nstarting with Europe and America? Should we not learn \nthe lesson of what happened in previous years and unite \nall international efforts so as to deal with those groups? \nThose organizations have rallied extremists from all \ncorners of the Earth and brought them to one place to \ntrain and arm them. They then spread their ideology \nand terrorism through those extremists back to where \nthey came from.\n\nSome people may say that a resolution was recently \nadopted unanimously under Chapter VII of the Charter \nof the United Nations in order to prevent the expansion \nof that organization and other terrorist groups and to \neradicate them. It is true that it is better to arrive late \nthan never. The resolution, adopted on 15 August, in \nfact came too late. However, the issue here is whether \neveryone is serious about its implementation, as we \nhave not yet seen any serious steps to implement it. \nFurthermore, we have not seen any real sense of fear \namong the regional States that continue to provide all \nkinds of support to those terrorist groups, not enough \nfear to cause them to work for the implementation of \nthe resolution. On the contrary, what we see on the \npart of the United States Administration is a policy of \ndouble standards and alliances in order to carry out \ncertain political agendas, in particular by supporting \nwith money, weapons and training groups that they call \nmoderate.\n\nThat will lead only to more violence and terrorism, \nthe shedding of more Syrian blood, a protracted Syrian \ncrisis and the prevention of any political solution. \nSuch behaviour creates fertile ground for the growth \nof terrorist groups that are committing the most \nheinous crimes on Syrian territory. That requires all \nof us to seriously and effectively address and eradicate \nterrorism in order to restore security and stability in \nSyria and the region. Today, enslaved women look to \nus to see what we will do for them, their sisters and \ntheir children. The sons and daughters of the victims \nbeheaded by ISIL await our action and our response in \nthe face of the atrocities that are being committed daily \nby that terrorist organization, the Nusra Front and other \ngroups.\n\nCombating terrorism cannot be achieved through \nunimplemented United Nations resolutions. Intentions \nare meaningless. We can fight terrorism through \nthe real implementation of resolutions or, clearly, by \nmeans of military strikes. But, most importantly, it \ncan be achieved by preventing States from arming, \nsupporting, training, funding and smuggling those \nterrorist groups. We must also deprive terrorism of its \nresources. Striking terrorism militarily while some \nStates continue to support terrorist groups will create a \nvicious cycle from which the international community \nwill not escape for decades.\n\nMilitary strikes should take place at the same time as \nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 2178 \n(2014), adopted on 24 September under Chapter VII. \nWe must also put pressure on countries that provide \nmultifaceted support to such terrorist groups. Those \ncountries are well known to us all. The most important \nissue is to put pressure on those countries that have \nexported and continue to export extremist Takfiri \nideology, thereby seriously jeopardizing international \npeace and security. ISIL is an ideology transformed into \nan organization that is supported, armed and trained \nto be unleashed against Syria, Iraq and Lebanon like a \nmonster.\n\nLet us together put an end to that ideology and \nits exporters. Let us simultaneously put pressure on \nthe countries that have joined the coalition led by the \nUnited States so as to put an end to their support of \narmed terrorist groups. Only then does combating \nterrorism militarily become viable. Otherwise, our \npresence there will not measure up to the tears of the \ncaptives, enslaved women and children who have fallen \nvictim to Daesh, the Nusrah Front and other groups.\n\nOnce again, the Syrian Arab Republic reiterates \nthat it stands with any international effort to combat \nterrorism. We stress that that must be done with full \nrespect for the lives of innocent civilians and for \nnational sovereignty, in conformity with international \nagreements. At the same time, the Syrian Arab \nRepublic would like to thank all countries that have \nstood firm and rejected any prejudice to the sovereignty \nof other States, underscoring respect for international \nresolutions.\n\nIt is high time to unite all our efforts against \nsuch terrorism, since everyone is surrounded by the \nimminent threat and no country is immune to it. My \ncountry maintains its declared position of the 1980s \nwith regard to fighting terrorism before it becomes \nrampant, as is currently happening.\n\n\nIn Syria we respect our commitments and honour \nour promises and pledges. We have confirmed that \nposition on more than one occasion, particularly since \nthe beginning of the Syrian crisis.\n\nSyria agreed unconditionally to attend the Geneva II \nConference on Syria and participated in its deliberations \nwith an open mind, although we were convinced that \nthe solution to the crisis should be Syrian-owned and \ntake place on Syrian territory. However, as a goodwill \ngesture, in order to put an end to the shedding of Syrian \nblood, we went to Geneva, only to find a delegation that \nwas not negotiating on behalf of Syrians.\n\nFirst, that delegation has no influence whatsoever \non the ground in Syria and has neither popularity nor \nlegitimacy among the Syrian people. The delegation \nwas negotiating with the Syrian Government while \nfollowing the orders of its Western masters. It does \nnot believe in combating or contronting terrorism. \nFurthermore, that delegation does not respect Syria\u2019s \nsovereignty and territorial integrity. and it verbally \nrefuses to ask terrorist groups to stop their terrorist acts. \nWe know that that opposition and delegation would not \nbe able to pressure anyone, either armed groups or any \nSyrian faction on the ground.\n\nWe went to Geneva with the priority of combating \nterrorism, since we believed, and continue to believe, \nthat we cannot embark on any political solution while \nterrorism is still rampant in Syria. Some in Geneva \nopposed our acknowledging the fight against terrorism \nas a priority, although it is a paramount part of the \nprovisions of the Geneva declaration. However, the \ndelegation of the so-called coalition continued to reject \nany proposal to tackle or to condemn terrorism.\n\nNow we see the entire international community \nadopting our view that fighting terrorism is the top \npriority and that nothing whatsoever can be done as \nlong as terrorism brutally strikes everything in its way \nand terrorists return to countries from which they came. \nOnce again, we emphasize that we are ready for, and \neven actively seek, a political solution in Syria and talks \nwith all honourable opposition members who oppose \nterrorism in Syria and among Syrians themselves on \nSyrian territory.\n\nEveryone assumed their responsibility in the \npresidential elections, which took place before the eyes \nof the world. The will of the Syrian people is greater \nthan that of all those who have tried to suppress it for \nmore than three years now. That was demonstrated \nwhen the entire world heard the voice of the Syrian \npeople both inside Syria and beyond.\n\nNow, after the presidential elections, we would \nlike to tell all those who desire and look forward \nto a political solution in Syria that they must first \nrespect the Syrian people\u2019s will, which was expressed \nexplicitly, clearly, firmly and loudly. For the first time \nin Syria\u2019s modern history, they chose their President \nin multiparty elections, with international monitors \nfrom several countries who witnessed the integrity and \ntransparency of the elections, as well as the enthusiasm \nof the people to participate in them.\n\nI would like to emphasize that the Syrian people \nhave made their choice. Those who want to speak on \nbehalf of the people must first be representatives of the \npeople and, secondly, must respect the people\u2019s will \nand their decisions. Any dialogue must therefore be \nbased on respect for the will of the Syrian people and \ntheir decisions. Accordingly, we are open to a political \nsolution in Syria with a genuine opposition that seeks \nthe prosperity, stability and security of Syria \u2014 an \nopposition that does not depend on external elements \nand speak on their behalf, an opposition that has an \nimpact in Syrian territory and has deep roots inside \nSyria, not in hotels and Western capitals. It must be \na national opposition that upholds fighting terrorism \nas its priority and encourages the ongoing national \nreconciliation efforts, paving the way for a successful \npolitical solution.\n\nHumanitarian needs in many basic areas have \nincreased because of the continuing terrorist attacks in \nSyria. The inhumane sanctions imposed by the European \nUnion and the United States have exacerbated the poor \nliving conditions of Syrian civilians. At the same time, \nmy Government is striving to meet the basic needs of \nour citizens, in particular those forced by terrorist acts \nto flee their homes. We are doing that in cooperation \nwith the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies, \nin the context of the humanitarian response plans \nagreed by those bodies with the Syrian Government.\n\nWe should note that a great number of our people \nhave been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring \ncountries. Regrettably, some of those countries put \ndisplaced Syrians in military training camps resembling \nplaces of detention in order to train them to take up \narms. From this rostrum, I underscore the fact that the \nSyrian State guarantees for those citizens who wish it \na safe return and a decent life, free from the inhumane \n\n\nconditions that they suffer in those camps. I affirm \nSyria\u2019s readiness to make every effort to deliver aid \nfrom international organizations to all Syrian citizens, \nwithout any discrimination whatsoever and wherever \nthey are, in the context of respect for our national \nsovereignty.\n\nThe Syrian Arab Republic confirms its resolve with \nregard to the full restoration of the occupied Syrian \nGolan up to the line of 4 June 1967. It also emphasizes \nits rejection of all actions taken by Israel, the occupying \nPower, to change the natural, geographical and \ndemographic characteristics of the Golan, in clear \nviolation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, \nin particular resolutions 497 (1981) and 465 (1980).\n\nSyria also affirms that the Palestinian question is \nthe central issue for the Syrian people, who support \nthe inalienable and legitimate rights of the brotherly \nPalestinian people, particularly their right to return, \nto self-determination and to establish an independent \nState on their land, with Jerusalem as the capital.\n\nLast September, Syria accepted the initiative of the \nPresident of the Russian Federation, His Excellency \nMr. Vladimir Putin, and acceded to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention on the basis of the need to render \nthe Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and \nall weapons of mass destruction. We also wanted to \nprove to the whole world our commitment to stand firm \nagainst any use of chemical weapons. Syria has met its \nobligations pursuant to its accession to the Convention \nand has fulfilled its commitments despite the current \ndifficult situation.\n\nWere it not for Syria\u2019s cooperation with the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \n(OPCW)-United Nations Joint Mission, the Mission \ncould not have completed that task. The Special \nCoordinator of the Joint Mission, Ms. Sigrid Kaag, \nexpressed her happiness at and gratitude for the Syrian \nGovernment\u2019s fruitful and constructive cooperation, \nwhich led to the completion of that unprecedented work.\n\nAs a State party, Syria is committed to the full \nimplementation of the provisions of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention within the framework of the \nOPCW. However, the big question remaining is whether \nthose who are supplying terrorists with chemical and \nother types of weapons will stop doing so and abide \nby international law, especially the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and the Security Council resolutions related \nto terrorism.\n\nSyria stresses that a Middle East zone free of all \nweapons of mass destruction cannot be established \nunless Israel, the only nuclear Power in the region, \naccedes to all treaties banning the proliferation of \nsuch weapons and puts its nuclear facilities under \nthe supervision of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. At the same time, we emphasize the right of \nall countries to acquire and develop nuclear technology \nfor peaceful uses.\n\nThe imposition of unethical, unilateral coercive \neconomic measures by the United States and the \nEuropean Union contravenes international law and the \nprinciples of free trade. Therefore, we call for lifting \nthe blockade that the United States has imposed on \nCuba for decades, and we renew our call to lift and \nstop all the unilateral coercive measures imposed on \nSyria and the peoples of other countries, such as Iran, \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Venezuela \nand Belarus.\n\nWe look forward to the United Nations being \nable to realize the aspirations of our peoples to live \nin dignity and to achieve development and food self-\nsufficiency, free from all forms of terrorism, tension \nand confrontation, in implementation of the principles \nand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in \nparticular safeguarding the States\u2019 sovereignty and \nequality in rights and obligations. We also believe that \npriority should be given to concerted efforts by the \ninternational community to combat the terrorism of \nDaesh, Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida affiliates and \nto drain their resources so that security and stability \nwill prevail in our region and the entire world.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring with me to this session of the \nGeneral Assembly greetings of peace, friendship and \nsolidarity from the people of Equatorial Guinea and \nthe full readiness of their Government to contribute to \nour common task of maintaining peace and stability \nthroughout the world, and promoting the harmonious \ndevelopment of humankind.\n\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on \nyour brilliant election to preside over the work of this \nsixty-ninth ordinary session of the General Assembly. \nYour well-deserved election is justified by the policy \nof peace, respect for the principles of international \nlaw and the promotion of development advocated by \nyour country, the Republic of Uganda. Indeed, your \ndecision to devote this session of the General Assembly \nto the theme \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d is \ntestament to Uganda\u2019s interest in overcoming the \ncurrent problems of underdevelopment throughout the \nworld.\n\nEquatorial Guinea recognizes the relevance and \nimportance of the topics to be debated at the two high-\nlevel meetings proposed for 2015 \u2014 one in February, \nto consider ways of implementing the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, and the other in March, on gender \nequality and the empowerment of women.\n\nWe also wish to convey our sincere appreciation and \ncongratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \noutstanding work at the head of the global Organization \nin very difficult international circumstances marked \nby terrorism, piracy, mercenary activities and major \nepidemics affecting the world today. Indeed, this session \nof the General Assembly bears the heavy responsibility \nof finding solutions to the problems of the poverty \nand hunger prevalent throughout the world, violence \nand armed conflicts, terrorism, piracy and mercenary \nactivity, and major epidemics, such as the recent Ebola \nepidemic that is now laying waste to some countries \nin Africa. Given Ebola\u2019s deadly effects and the lack \nof adequate resources to combat it, on the occasion of \nthe award of the second UNESCO Equatorial Guinea \nInternational Prize for Research in Life Sciences, the \nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \nannounced a donation of $2 million to the World Health \nOrganization to finance programmes to combat Ebola.\n\nThe United Nations will not be able to find solutions \nto these thorny problems unless the role of the General \nAssembly, which in recent years has grown routine, is \nstrengthened and revitalized. The United Nations will \nnever be able to find lasting solutions to these problems \nif the Security Council is not governed by rules that \nrespect the spirit of democracy and international \njustice. Ultimately, the United Nations will not be able \nto find satisfactory solutions to these problems as long \nas the current system of the rule of force in international \nrelations persists.\n\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea is therefore very \nconcerned by the proliferation of acts of intervention \nthat do not respect the principle of non-interference \nin the internal affairs of States. These interventions \ninterrupt the process of genuine democracy in the \naffected countries in that they ignore the essential \ncharacteristics and idiosyncracies of those societies, \nthereby further fuelling divisions and the sociopolitical \ninstability of nations. We must distinguish clearly \nbetween support for a genuine internal democratic \nprocess and interference perpetrated through pressures \nthat lead to misunderstandings, intolerance, exclusion, \nresentment, hatred among citizens and fratricidal wars.\n\nIn Equatorial Guinea we say that democracy is \nnot an imported product and cannot be designed in \nthe offices of other countries. Democracy is shaped by \nthe application of the positive values characterizing a \nsociety, and only the people are entitled to define the \nmodel that best suits them and to beat their own path \ntowards their own development. With this as our vision, \nin 1982 the Republic of Equatorial Guinea adopted the \ntheory of democratic experimentation, which gave our \nown citizens, through community councils, a hand \nin designing their own political development, the \nimplementation of which has given rise to the current \nclimate of peace, stability and economic prosperity \nthrough successive political reforms.\n\nThe latest of these reforms is making Equatorial \nGuinea a modern democratic State in which popular \nparticipation and representational politics are ensured \nat the highest possible level. The transfer of power is \nguaranteed by equal rights for all political options. \nPublic affairs are administered with the utmost \ntransparency, accountability and responsibility, and \nhuman rights are protected and monitored by reliable \ninstitutions.\n\nIn this spirit of ensuring the participation of all \ncitizens of Equatorial Guineans in the management and \nadministration of public affairs, our Government has \nextended an invitation to all political parties \u2014 those \nwithin the country and those in the diaspora alike \u2014 to \n\n\n\nattend a national dialogue that will be held in November \nas an opportunity to strengthen democracy in our \ncountry as a positive experience in our democratic \nexperiment, which has yielded fruit since its inception \nin 1982.\n\nConcurrently with this political process, and thanks \nto the peace and political stability that we have achieved, \nour Government has undertaken economic initiatives to \ndevelop our natural resources and position Equatorial \nGuinea as an economically emerging country by 2020. \nOn behalf of the people of Equatorial Guinea, I wish to \nthank those countries that have been cooperating with \nmy Government in developing our economic and trade \nrelations, in particular the United States of America, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba, \nFrance, Brazil, Russia and Morocco.\n\nIn conclusion, and with the fervent wish to see the \nUnited Nations recover its leading role in delivering \npeace, security and global development, I wish the \nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly every \nsuccess.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Sam \nKutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am convinced that \nhis international prestige and experience will make an \nimportant contribution to the crafting of sustainable \npolitical solutions to the new global challenges that \nlie ahead of us. I would also like to convey Serbia\u2019s \nreadiness to address and provide unequivocal support \nto the resolution of priorities relative to climate change, \nan integrated global economy, international security \nissues and all other topics included in the agenda that \nwe will actively pursue.\n\nI should like to express my special thanks to \noutgoing President, Mr. John Ashe, for his efforts and \nsuccessful work during the sixty-eighth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, which laid down the foundations for \nthe post-2015 sustainable development agenda, as well \nas for his endeavours to strengthen the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations.\n\nThe sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly \nis being held at a time when we mark an important \nanniversary, 100 years having elapsed since the \n\noutbreak of the Great War, a war which shaped the \ntwentieth century. The anniversary was commemorated \nat different places, but, regrettably, no common \nceremony at the highest level was organized in the \nspirit of reconciliation and forgiveness.\n\nSerbia strongly supports the General Assembly \nagenda for the sixty-ninth session and sees itself as an \nactive partner and participant in the implementation \nof United Nations development goals. The world is \nfaced with new security, climate and socioeconomic \nchallenges. We need to do much work together to ensure \nhumankind\u2019s progress in the twenty-first century. \nSerbia offers its experiences and ideas for global \nmanagement, so that we can ensure a better future for \nnew generations all over the world.\n\nAllow me to consider three of today\u2019s most \npressing global challenges that concern not just Serbia \nbut all of us \u2014 climate change, global security and \ndeadly infectious diseases of vast proportions. I believe \nthat, if not addressed wisely and systematically, those \nchallenges could put the survival of future generations \nin jeopardy.\n\nSocioeconomic interrelatedness accounts for the \ndisappearance of the old division into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. \nAll of us, all States Members of the United Nations, \nshare the same destiny and shoulder equal responsibility \nfor the problems that directly face humankind. One of \nthe urgent global challenges that we are confronting \nis climate change. At the Climate Summit 2014, in \nwhich I participated with great interest, we discussed \nthe historic chance that we shall have at the upcoming \nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris \nin 2015. Consensus among scientists indicates that the \nglobal temperatures in the twenty-first century will \nrise dramatically. Extreme weather conditions will \nincrease, with a frequency that depends on the intensity \nof global warming. Inexorably, the effects of natural \ndisasters aggravate the fragile economic situation in \nSerbia and the region of South-East Europe and make \nthe struggle against poverty ever more difficult. That \nstruggle remains the quintessential challenge facing the \nworld today.\n\nActivities aimed at alleviating the consequences \nof climate change are the imperative of our age. In \ndetermining binding measures, surely we should \ntake account of the development needs of poor and \nunderdeveloped countries. I am convinced that the \nAssembly shares my opinion that there is a need to act, \nas soon as possible, to improve adaptation systems and \nto establish mechanisms for lowering the risks posed \nby natural disasters. I therefore view this year as an \nopportunity to kick off intensive activities in devising \nclimate policy and encouraging countries to commit to \nreducing carbon emissions. We have a historic chance to \ndevise an energy policy that is sustainable and provides \nfor substantive global action on climate change policy. I \nam convinced that we all share the view that it is urgent \nand obligatory to improve the adaptation system and \nset up mechanisms for reducing the enormous risks of \nnatural disasters. Serbia wishes to contribute to reaching \na legally binding, general consent on climate for all the \npeoples of the world. I believe that the Green Climate \nFund should play an important role in the process of \nimplementing the agreed principles. By 2020, it should \nachieve its ambitious goal and fulfil the commitments \nwe have made for the sake of humankind.\n\nThis year, I witnessed, and my country was a \nvictim of, extreme weather conditions in Europe. \nUnfortunately, Serbia and its neighbours in the region \nwere subjected to natural disasters as a consequence \nof climate change. Serbia was and is vulnerable these \ndays, all over again, to floods of biblical proportions. \nI take this opportunity to express my gratitude to \nthe United Nations for its extensive and efficient \nengagement and cooperation with the Government of \nSerbia in the aftermath of the floods. In particular, I \nwould like to thank French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \nfor heeding my call to convene a donors conference to \nhelp Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. I would also \nlike to thank the European Commission, the members \nof the European Union, the Russian Federation, China, \nJapan, Belarus, African countries and the countries of \nthe region for their assistance and engagement. Without \ntheir generous bilateral assistance, we would not have \nbeen able to help everyone in dire need. Short of the \nselfless assistance of Member States, we would not \nhave been able to help the affected people, many of \nwhom lost everything they had acquired during their \nlifetime.\n\nThe national priority of Serbia is to achieve a \nsustainable political solution on the question of Kosovo \nand Metohija. For Serbia, the only acceptable, fair and \njust solution is to reject secessionism and preserve the \nterritorial integrity of every country, including Serbia. \nSerbia therefore is clearly committed to the quest for \na sustainable political solution through dialogue with \nrepresentatives of the Provisional Institutions of Self-\n\nGovernment in Pristina. The political solution that \nSerbia advocates comprehends the interests of the \nSerbian, Albanian and other populations. It will be \na durable political solution that is satisfactory to all \nparties, and we can reach it only through constructive \ndialogue.\n\nThe normalization of relations between Belgrade \nand Pristina is contributing to the process of European \nintegration. We expect the European Union to continue \nto encourage, through its active engagement, an open \ndialogue and compliance with agreed-on obligations in \norder to strengthen mutual trust. Serbia has complied, \nresponsibly and on time, with all the obligations it has \nundertaken to date regarding the implementation of \nthe Brussels Agreement. I would like to point out that \nSerbia is open to continuing constructive dialogue with \nPristina at every level.\n\nIn accordance with Security Council resolution \n1244 (1999), the United Nations Interim Administration \nMission in Kosovo (UNMIK) is the guarantor and the \nbasis for action by all other international missions \nin Kosovo and Metohija. For Serbia, a reduction in \nUNMIK\u2019s mandate and competencies in Kosovo and \nMetohija is unacceptable. In its negotiations with the \nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government in Pristina, \nSerbia proceeds from the premise that all solutions must \nbe in accordance with the Constitution of Serbia and \nresolution 1244 (1999). That concerns questions having \nto do with the province\u2019s status, the position of Serbs \nand other non-Albanians in the province, and protection \nof the Serbian religious and cultural heritage.\n\nOur approach to the search for a sustainable \npolitical solution for Kosovo and Metohija has broader \npolitical implications. I believe we can all agree that the \ncreation of conditions for the enjoyment of basic human \nrights and minority rights would not only promote \nthe return of the displaced population but would also \nprovide a model for political dialogue and toleration, \nthe assumptions of today\u2019s world and the policies of \npeace that the United Nations spearheads.\n\nCreating optimal conditions for internally displaced \npersons to return to their homes is the key factor in the \nprocess of normalizing relations between Belgrade and \nPristina. I would like to recall that everything began \nwith the acts of terror committed by the Albanian \nminority in Kosovo and Metohija aimed at achieving \ntheir secessionist ambitions. Today, 15 years after the \nadoption of resolution 1244 (1999) \u2014 by which we ceded \nadministration of the province of Kosovo and Metohija \nto the United Nations \u2014 the conditions conducive to \nreturning internally displaced persons to Kosovo and \nMetohija have still not been created, something that \nis noted in the Secretary-General\u2019s regular reports \non UNMIK\u2019s work and in the reports of the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n(UNHCR) and the Special Rapporteur on the human \nrights of internally displaced persons.\n\nSerbia has the largest number of internally \ndisplaced persons of any country in Europe, a total of \n230,000. They must not remain mere statistics. They \nmust not be forgotten. There are 58,000 refugees living \nin Serbia, 42,000 from Croatia and 16,000 from Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. I believe refugees deserve special \nattention from the United Nations and UNHCR. The \nmarginalization of the serious problems that those \nvulnerable people face should be condemned rather \nthan ignored. The issue of basic human rights is a \nuniversal one, respected by every State Member of the \nUnited Nations. Any hasty decision on the issue would \nbe a mistake, since it could undermine the region\u2019s \nreconciliation processes, which are not yet fully \nformed, as well as the fundamental right of Serbs to \nreturn to their homes in Kosovo, Croatia, and Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n\nSerbia has taken a step forward into the future, \nand wishes to make an active contribution to global \neconomic progress, the suppression of crime and \ncorruption, and the quest for a solution to all matters \nof international security. Membership in the European \nUnion is our foreign policy priority. Like any other form \nof international association, the European Union falls \nshort of achieving ideal solutions and is saddled with its \nown challenges and issues relating to its enlargement, \nbut it is still the best community of European States. \nSerbia\u2019s place is with its members so that it can fully \nmodernize its society and State and further develop \nits economic capacities. The clear goal we aspire to is \nto build Serbia into a respected member of the family \nof European nations, and our progress in membership \nnegotiations will contribute to that.\n\nSerbia is preparing to assume the chairmanship \nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (OSCE) next year. That role and task present \nmy country with complex, multilateral challenges, but \nwe are ready for them, and we have been preparing \nin collaboration with Switzerland in positive and \nconstructive cooperation. Serbia will use the OSCE \nchairmanship to encourage and strengthen mutual \n\n\ncooperation among the countries in the region. The \nBalkan countries have made immense progress in \nrecent years and have developed substantial and \ncomprehensive mutual cooperation. Serbia will make \nevery effort to see that the process of reconciliation and \ncooperation and mutual respect is fully implemented \nthroughout the region. The chairmanship will also be \nused to encourage those processes.\n\nWe are deeply disturbed and alarmed by the \nevents in Ukraine and will do everything in our power \nto help find a peaceful solution to the problem and \novercome differences peacefully. Our Slav brothers \ndeserve peace and tranquil development, along with \nrespect for those universal principles that should be \naccorded all countries and peoples and that are clearly \ndefined in the Charter of the United Nations. Serbia \nrespects the territorial integrity of Ukraine as a United \nNations Member, and the equitable implementation \nof international law. I recall that some countries \ndenied Serbia that right through their recognition and \npromotion of the independence of a part of the territory \nof Serbia \u2014 Kosovo and Metohija.\n\nThe principles of safeguarding peace and security, \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and crises and \nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nMember States are the bases on which the Republic of \nSerbia will cooperate in the search for solutions to the \nvarious political and security challenges in the world. At \nthe global level, therefore, we support all efforts by the \nUnited Nations and its Member States and by regional \norganizations to find diplomatic solutions to the world\u2019s \nmost sensitive security issues. With its broad political \nexperience and bold leadership, Serbia can contribute, \nthrough dialogue with friends, partners and Member \nStates, to devising solutions to the disagreements that \nthreaten to disunite the world all over again.\n\nSerbia is making a concrete contribution to \nmaintaining international peace by participating in \nUnited Nations and European Union peacekeeping \noperations. Thanks to that work and to our cooperation \nwith allies and partners, the region is more stable than \nit was 15 years ago. I would point out that we support \nevery initiative aimed at modifying and adapting peace \noperations to new security challenges. Serbia calls for \nstrengthening regional cooperation and harmonizing \napproaches to the activities of peacekeeping missions.\n\nSerbia\u2019s new policy has fostered sincere and fully \ntransparent relations in South-Eastern Europe. That was \nparticularly evident during the disastrous floods that \nstruck Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \nsolidarity and magnanimity shown then set an example \nfor the entire world. Today our region is teeming with \ninvestment opportunities, and a strong and peaceful \nSouth-Eastern Europe is synonymous with a strong and \nstable Europe as a whole.\n\nSerbia has experienced acts of terrorism on \nits territory in Kosovo and Metohija. We therefore \nunderstand very well the security problems the \nworld is facing. We firmly condemn every form of \nterrorism. We are ready to discuss any initiative \nthat can contribute to strengthening the role of the \nUnited Nations in combating that global evil. Serbia \nhas achieved significant success in the fight against \nterrorism, especially at the regional level, and is ready \nto lend its experience and knowledge to help strengthen \nother States\u2019 counter-terrorism capacities.\n\nSerbia has never supported and will never support \nthe language of ultimatums. We honour and respect the \npolitical and economic interests of all Member States, \nand our approach and actions in protecting our national \nand international interests are predicated on those \npositions.\n\nSerbia most strongly condemns the crimes committed \nby the members of the extremist organization of the \nIslamic State, particularly the brutal murders. Such \nforms of terrorism pose one of the most serious threats \nto international peace and security, and Serbia is \ncommitted more than ever to supporting international \nefforts in the fight against terrorism.\n\nThe rapid rise of the Islamic State and its ability \nto attract fighters from all over the world has caught \nthe attention of the international community. One of \nthe main questions facing the world is the problem of \nforeign fighters recruited by terrorist organizations \nsuch as the Islamic State and Al-Qaida. According to \nresearch conducted by the International Centre for the \nStudy of Radicalization and Political Violence, based in \nLondon, the most significant regions outside Western \nEurope and the Middle East for the recruitment of \nforeign fighters are the Balkans and the countries of \nthe former Soviet Union. The data on foreign fighters \nfor the Balkans vary: up to 140 recruits from Albania \nand as many as 60 from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \nnumbers are somewhat smaller from Macedonia \u2014 up \nto 20. From Serbia there have been three and from \nBulgaria one, while the number from our province \n\nof Kosovo and Metohija is as high as 150. It must be \nstopped.\n\nWe face new global challenges that call for \ncreative responses, global partnership and flexibility. \nSerbia is unreservedly committed to the principles \nof multilateral cooperation and to strengthening the \nprinciples and system of the United Nations. In that \ncontext, we consider the process of the reform of the \nUnited Nations system a historic chance to demonstrate \nour consistent support for the idea of building consensus \namong Member States on all key issues. Serbia is \nready for constructive cooperation and respect for all \nparticipants in the dialogue, which will contribute to \nthe greater efficiency of the United Nations system. \nSerbia supports the reform of the Security Council.\n\nSerbia will do its utmost to help bring solutions to \nglobal security problems and sustainable development. \nTraditionally, Serbia has supported the multilateral \napproach in the field of disarmament and arms control, \nproceeding from the conviction that in a world of rising \ninterdependence and complexity, common challenges \ncall for common solutions.\n\nIt is with great concern that we follow the \ndevelopments related to the rapid spread of the Ebola \nvirus in the countries of Western Africa. We extend our \ncondolences to the Presidents and peoples of Liberia, \nGuinea and Sierra Leone for the great number of \nvictims. The disease, unprecedented in the extent of \nits transmission and its high mortality rate, threatens \nto cause one of the biggest humanitarian crises of the \nworld today and calls for immediate collective action, \nsince it is a problem that belongs to all of us. It is very \nimportant in this situation that States Members of the \nUnited Nations have recognized the magnitude of the \nproblem and have supported the Secretary-General\u2019s \nproposal to establish the United Nations Mission for \nEbola Emergency Response. Serbia is ready to join in \nand contribute to the collective effort with its scientific \nand medical capacities and in any other way.\n\nThe world has changed, but for the poorest it has \nremained the same. The greater instability of developing \ncountries is a clear indicator that they continue to be \nin need of assistance. The international community \nmust therefore pay appropriate attention to that group \nof countries, primarily through financial support, the \ndevelopment of new technologies and the training of \nhuman resources. Those are measures meant to lead \nto the eradication of poverty and the strengthening of \ninstitutions.\n\nFor Serbia, the top priority is poverty eradication, \nbut the goals of inclusive education, health, gender \nequality, sustainable energy and, in particular, \nsustainable economic growth and employment are just \nas important. Jump-starting the economy is the mission \nto which we shall devote the greatest attention in the \ncoming period, although always mindful of the issues \nI have mentioned, in order to ensure prosperity for all \nour citizens.\n\nWe must acknowledge the higher degree of \nsocioeconomic interlinkage that exists if we are to \ncome up with fresh ideas. We must design new ways to \novercome the current crises in global management and \nstudy our options for formulating and implementing \npolitical solutions.\n\nSerbia stands united with the leaders of the entire \nworld in the endeavour aimed at bringing prosperity to \nhumankind. That is a responsibility that we all share. \nNot only can we achieve much by working together, but \nwe can achieve much more together. That is why the \nestablishment of a united, global front around the idea \nof the common destiny and interests of humankind, \nwhich we all share, should be the first step that we, the \nStates Members of the United Nations, must make as \nwe attempt to solve new global challenges.\n"

        "file_text": "\nMother Earth and humanity are suffering, stricken by \nthe environmental, climate, financial and food crises \ngenerated by an inhumane, predatory capitalism that \nturns human life and Mother Earth into merchandise. \nToday we have an historic opportunity to build a new, \ndifferent world, and we must do so without delay. \nThe post-2015 agenda must express that mandate that \nMother Earth and humanity demand of us.\n\nWe welcome the proposal of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals that \nincorporates the proposals of Bolivia and the peoples \nof the world to respect Mother Earth and the concept of \nharmony with nature. That is not a matter of a simple \npolitical statement. It is a commitment shared with \nthe entire world to change our visions of development \nto a more comprehensive, holistic vision. What we \npropose to the world is living well, in harmony with \nMother Earth, and the construction of a culture of life, \ncomplementarity, solidarity and peace.\n\nRespect for Mother Earth has been lost. Today \nshe is being marketed and manipulated, causing grave \ndanger to life. Now as at no other time, the premise \nthat man believes himself to be the lord and master of \nnature is more true than ever. Humankind, encouraged \nby capitalism, has turned everything into a market, \nincluding genetic manipulation and the destruction of \nhuman beings.\n\nHuman and natural life and their happiness \nshould be the reason why any vision, tool or focus for \ndevelopment exists. No vision of development makes \nsense if it does not respect or strengthen life. Economic \ngrowth does not in itself lead to the realization of \nsocial rights and good living. The horizon of equality \ncalls for the distribution of wealth and the economic \nand political empowerment of the poor, the excluded \nand the marginalized. It calls for strengthening \ncommunities and building societies with solidarity, not \nexclusive societies based on the accumulation of wealth \nand governed by money, covetousness and the avarice \nof the market.\n\nTogether with the Group of 77 and China, I must \nstate the fundamental importance of recovering the \nsovereignty of our countries and peoples over our natural \nresources. It is only by recovering control of our natural \nresources that we will be able to garner greater benefits \nfor our peoples, in particular to eliminate poverty and \nto invest in economic diversification, industrialization \nand social programmes.\n\nEach country has the right to decide on its priorities \nand strategies for development, but it is important that \nthose strategies strengthen the environmental functions \nand the ecosystems of Mother Earth in the framework \nof complementarity and mutual support between \nproductive systems, communities and nature. It is vital \nto strike a balance between the rights of Mother Earth, \nthe right to development, the rights of indigenous \npeoples and social, economic and cultural rights, as \nwell as the right of the poor to emerge from poverty. \nComplementarity and mutual support, not commercial \nincentives, are instruments to preserve Mother Earth. \nOn this point we differ from the followers of the so-\ncalled green economy.\n\nAn important issue to be promoted in the framework \nof the post-2015 agenda is the human right to water and \nthe right of Mother Earth to enjoy water for regenerating \nand reproducing life. Three billion people today live in \nareas or regions where the demand for water exceeds \nits availability, and that reality will worsen as years \npass. By 2030 the demand for water will have increased \nby 30 per cent. In 2050, four billion people will suffer \nfrom critical scarcity of water in the context of climate \nchange.\n\nIn Bolivia, in accordance with human right to \nwater and with our Constitution, and thanks to the \nnational programme known as My Water, we have \nalready reached the Millennium Goals. We did so three \nyears ahead of schedule. Declaring the human right to \nwater means it cannot be privatized. Water is life, and \nit cannot be an object of profit or commercialization. \nLikewise, to resolve serious social inequalities, basic \nservices such as water, electricity, telecommunications \nand basic sanitation, as well as education and health, \nmust be a human right.\n\nWe have a pending agenda to eradicate poverty \nand hunger, but for that we must also fight the pitiless, \ninhumane forces of capital and the market, the \nomnipresent power of banks and usurers who profit \nfrom consumerism and hunger. The so-called vulture \nfunds are an expression of that. They are agents of \nfinancial rapine who live off speculation, stealing from \ndeveloping countries with impunity, taking the bread \nfrom the poor, extorting and defrauding with the help \nof the legal systems of capitalism. They caused the \nfinancial crisis and profited from it.\n\nWe must profoundly change the exclusionary \nstructures of financial institutions, such as the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \nThat should be part of the transformation of the world \nfinancial architecture. Those organizations cannot be \ngoverned only by developed countries, which, through \nclever financial strategies, blackmail and oppress \ndeveloping countries, especially the poorest. That is \nwhat we call eradicating financial colonialism.\n\nIn the world there still exists an offensive, abusive \nreality \u2014 the 1.3 billion poor people and more than \n800 million who are chronically malnourished \u2014 as \nwell as the gaps between the rich and the poor. That \nis due to an unequal distribution of income, but also \nto an unequal and discriminatory access to wealth, to \nthe means and factors to live well and to enjoy basic \nservices. The increase in the number of hungry people \nin the world is due, without doubt, to the financial \ncrisis. If not for that, there would now be 413 million \nfewer hungry people in the world. But the eradication \nof hunger and poverty is unthinkable without changing \nthe international financial architecture.\n\nThe violence of war feeds the darkest interests, \nsuch as the geopolitical control of the great Powers and \ncorporations that promote conflicts in order to ensure \ntheir imperial or neocolonial interests. Today, it is the \neconomic interests of capital that promote neocolonial \nwars. With the expense required for war campaigns, \nhumankind could overcome many of its problems, \nincluding the Ebola virus, tuberculosis, AIDS or \ndengue.\n\nWe have again witnessed the cruelty and barbarity \nof the genocidal actions of the Government of Israel \nagainst the Palestinian civilian population. We have \ntherefore denounced Israel for violating international \nhumanitarian law and universal human rights. We \ndemand an investigation of the crimes committed by \nIsrael in the Gaza Strip. The Plurinational State of \nBolivia, like other Latin American countries, agrees on \nthe profound need to reiterate the legitimacy of United \nNations resolutions demanding the end of the occupation \nof the Palestinian territories and the construction of an \nindependent State within the borders existing prior to \n4 June 1967. That is why we again reiterate the need \nto recognize Palestine as a full-fledged Member of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nAs Chair of the Group of 77 and China, I cannot \nfail to mention the important commemoration of the \nfiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Group of 77, \n\n\nheld on 14 and 15 June in the city of Santa Cruz de \nla Sierra, Bolivia. The Summit of Heads of State and \nGovernment of the Group of 77 and China adopted a \ndeclaration entitled \u201cFor a new world order for living \nwell\u201d (see A/68/948), which confirms the principles of \nunity, complementarity and solidarity and the building \nof a new world order that establishes a more just and \ndemocratic system for the benefit of our peoples.\n\nWe commend the Bolivarian Alliance for the \nPeoples of Our America-Peoples\u2019 Trade Agreement \n(ALBA-TCP) on completing 10 years of tireless work \ntowards the integration of peoples. That work goes \nbeyond commercial profit and focuses on promoting the \nvalues of cooperation, solidarity and complementarity. \nIn its 10 years, ALBA-TCP has become a major player \nin Latin America and the world.\n\nSince March 2011, 150,000 people have died in \nSyria and 3 million people have fled as refugees to \nneighbouring countries. Bolivia agrees that the future \nand destiny of Syria must be determined by the Syrian \npeople themselves in the full exercise of democracy, in \naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nBolivia condemns and rejects the interference by \nthe United States of America in Iraq that triggered the \ncurrent crisis in the country. The war unleashed in 2003 \nagainst Iraq destabilized the entire region. It was said \nthat Iraq possessed large quantities of weapons of mass \ndestruction. That argument remains one of the biggest \nlies ever told in the history of imperialism. On the basis \nof that lie, peaceful coexistence among social, ethnic \nand religious groups has been destroyed. The situation \nhas given rise to a terrorist group called the Islamic \nState that is imposing a new war that threatens the entire \nregion. Bolivia rejects the extreme violence with which \nthat terrorist group has acted against civil society and \nwholeheartedly affirms that nothing justifies fratricidal \nviolence.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq, together with other historical \nevents, has taught us a lesson that wherever the United \nStates of America intervenes, it leaves destruction, \nhatred, misery and death in its wake, but it also leaves \nwealth in the hands of those who profit from the wars: \nthe transnational corporations of the arms industry and \nthe oil industry. We must make use of the culture of \npeace to eradicate extremist fanaticism, but also the \nimperial warmongering promoted by the United States, \nwhich, faced with war, threatens more war. The United \nNations was created to build and promote peace, not to \njustify wars and invasions.\n\nUsing war against war is not the same as peace. \nThat is a perverse formula \u2014 the formula for death and \nendless confrontation. We must resolve the structural \ncauses of war: marginalization, poverty, lack of \nopportunities, cultural and political exclusion, social \ndiscrimination, inequality, usurpation and territorial \ndispossession, ruthless capitalism and dictatorship of \nthe interests of transnational corporations. Every year \nhere we hear Mr. Obama deliver a discourse on war, \narrogance and threats against the peoples of the world. \nIt is also a discourse of extremist fanaticism.\n\nThe economic, commercial and financial blockade \nimposed by the Government of the United States \nagainst Cuba is the main tool of United States policy \nin its eagerness to destroy the revolution and restore its \nhegemony over Cuban territory. The blockade against \nCuba is the most unjust, severe and prolonged system of \nunilateral sanctions that has ever been applied against \nany country. The blockade qualifies an act of genocide. \nThat colonial blockade must be ended immediately.\n\nWe want to affirm before this Assembly the historic \nright of the Bolivian people to their access to the sea \u2014 a \nright that was trampled by a brutal invasion promoted \nby colonial business interests. The colonial imposition, \nthe absence of genuine participatory democracy and the \ninterests of foreign companies were interposed between \nthe Bolivian and Chilean peoples, fraternal peoples who \nwere led to a war favouring the transnationals. Because \nmy country firmly believes in and promotes peace and \nharmony in our relations with all of our neighbours, we \nturned to the International Court of Justice in search \nof dialogue to resolve, peacefully and in good faith, \na prolonged dispute over our sovereign access to the \nPacific Ocean.\n\nOur demand does not seek to alter the international \norder of the limits and boundaries or to threaten \ninternational treaties, as the the Government of Chile \nwould have people believe. On the contrary, Bolivia has \ninvoked international law and its principles to resolve, \nmethodically and in good faith, the issue of its sovereign \naccess to the Pacific Ocean. An effective and peaceful \nsolution regarding Bolivia\u2019s sovereign access to the \nsea would be in the interests of our peoples, the new \ngenerations, the region and the whole world. I therefore \ncall on all countries of the United Nations system at \nthis sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly to join \nus, not only Bolivia, but our neighbour Chile, in this \nchallenge to peace, justice and rule of law.\n\nWe must eradicate violence and war and denounce \nthe imperialist warmongering of the world Powers that \n\n\narrogantly believe they embody the ideals of freedom. \nThe imperial Powers use their communication media \nto manipulate the wills and the emotions of the people. \nThey lie and deceive with impunity. They divide and \npit nations and communities against one another to \npromote wars, control strategic resources and put them \nat the service of their foreign capitals.\n\nThis is the century of peace, but peace with \nsovereignty, with freedom for peoples and not with a \nfree market. This is the century of agreements on liberty, \nlife and peace and not for agreements on free trade \nin life. There will be no harmony if the arrogance of \nempires and their renewed colonialism harass, oppress \nand kill human beings, cultures and the peoples of the \nworld. The empire of finance, the empire of markets, \nthe empire of the arms industry must all fall to give way \nto the wisdom of life and life in peace and harmony.\n\nTo summarize with the greatest respect and \nadmiration for the Assembly, I would like to say that if \nwe want to put an end to poverty, if we want to defend \nlife and Mother Earth, our only path is to put an end \nto the capitalist system and imperious thinking for the \nwell-being of humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to stand once again before the Assembly \u2014 the \nlast time I shall do so in my two terms as President of \nIndonesia. I could not agree more with the theme chosen \nfor this session, \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, which \nis very much in line with the work of the High-level \nPanel I have been privileged to co-chair.\n\nFor the past 15 years, the international community \nhas been working on a grand and ambitious project \nfor humankind, the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Our hard work over the years has produced \nachievements that include breakthroughs in combating \npoverty, increasing school enrolment and improving \npublic health. Those achievements are encouraging and, \nin some instances, inspiring. But humankind as a whole \nhas not achieved all the MDG targets. The successes \nhave been uneven, differing between regions, within \nregions and even within countries. We have come a \nlong way, yet we still have a long way to go.\n\nFor those who have made it, as well as for those \nwho have yet to make it, I have learned one great lesson, \nwhich is that the most important driver of change \nlies in governance \u2014 not just good governance, but \nsmart governance. Smart governance usually involves \ninnovative leadership and active public participation. \nWithout at least those two elements, all the hard work \nwe put in will not produce the desired results. And with \nsmart governance, nations can exceed their potential \nand leapfrog over others ahead of them. In Indonesia we \nhave managed to increase our national per capita income \nby 400 per cent within just one decade, something that \nwas beyond our wildest imagination.\n\nThe quest to achieve the MDGs over the past \n15 years has also reinforced the need for a more robust \nglobal partnership. There has certainly been much \nactivity. But somehow, our efforts in the World Trade \nOrganization, on the post-Kyoto climate, on reforming \nthe global financial architecture and the United Nations \nand in many other areas have proved painfully slow.\n\nAs we set forth a new global agenda for development, \nI believe we can draw on those years of trial and error to \nbecome more acutely aware of the promises and pitfalls \nof development, and of what we want and what we do \nnot want. We do not want development that measures \nprogress in terms of material possessions alone and \nends up dehumanizing and marginalizing our citizens. \nWhat we want is sustainable development with equity.\n\nYet the importance of our work lies beyond the \nissue of development, since we are now also confronted \nwith yet another major problem. We are witnessing a \nworrying deterioration in the relations between the \nmajor Powers. None of us, certainly not the United \nNations, can afford to bury our heads in the sand about \nthat grim development.\n\n\nIt is especially worrying, given that for more than \ntwo decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world \nactually witnessed a series of promising events. Most \nfundamental was the fact that improved relations among \nthe major Powers created ample space for new strategic \nand economic opportunities. Global trade totals have \nreached $23 trillion, an almost six-fold expansion since \nthe year after the Cold War ended in 1990. The fastest \ngrowth \u2014 one and a half times as fast as during the \npreceding two decades \u2014 was from 2000 to 2013, the \nperiod that coincided with our work on the MDGs. The \nvalue of global investments reached almost $1.5 trillion \nin 2013 for a near seven-fold increase since 1990.\n\nIn South-East Asia, that positive geopolitical \ndevelopment has allowed us to develop stronger \ncooperation and to develop the region\u2019s architecture. \nIt led to the establishment of the East Asia Summit, a \nvision for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) community, a progressive ASEAN Charter, \na more active ASEAN Regional Forum and other \ninstitutions. And Indonesia has also been able to develop \nstrategic partnerships with all the major Powers as well \nas with many emerging Powers.\n\nToday I see that the international community \nis concerned about the danger of the old Cold War \nreturning. Major-Power relations are worsening, \nfuelled by mutual suspicion. Relationships that were \npreviously stable and cooperative are now marked by \nvolatility and tension. That benefits no one, and we \nshould therefore not let it become permanent. The \nmajor Powers \u2014 indeed, all of us \u2014 have an obligation \nto work together to resolve the major issues of our time. \nTo mention only a few, we must end the suffering of \nthe Palestinians in Gaza and the rest of the occupied \nterritory and deliver the still elusive two-State solution. \nWe must resolve the conflict in Ukraine that is now \nupsetting relations between Russia and the West. And \nwe must find an effective and durable solution to the \nongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.\n\nTo do all of this, there must be mutual \naccommodation. There must be a forward-looking \nattitude that embraces a win-win predisposition \nrather than a zero-sum attitude. Diplomacy must take \nprecedence. The deficit of trust must be transformed \ninto strategic opportunities and confidence-building. \nIt is not enough just to call for peaceful coexistence. \nThat is so twentieth century. Here in the twenty-first \ncentury, we need much more than conditions in which \nworld Powers merely peacefully coexist. We need those \nPowers to work passionately together in order to foster \nstrategic cooperation and to tackle global issues. They \nmust begin to turn the trust deficit into a new strategic \ntrust not only among themselves but also with emerging \nPowers and with all nations of the United Nations. Is \nthat possible? I would say a resolute yes, for that is \nwhat has transpired in South-East Asia. In the second \nhalf of the 1960s, South-East Asian nations were poor, \ndivided and insecure, threatened by a war raging in \ntheir neighbourhood and ignorant of one another after \ncenturies of separation during the colonial past.\n\nThe establishment of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations enabled countries in the region to form \nthe habit of dialogue and consultation with one another \nand to learn to trust one another. Today, we can proudly \nsay that the once-divided 10 South-East Asian nations \nnow belong to ASEAN-10. Together, they are all drivers \nof regional affairs and masters of their own destiny. A \nnumber of sensitive inter-State and intra-State conflicts \nhave been peacefully resolved. Those that remain are \nbeing addressed through dialogue and negotiation. \nEconomic interdependence has become the norm of the \nday.\n\nMoreover, South-East Asia is on the verge of \nbecoming a true community. We regard that as the apex \nof strategic trust, which we believe can be replicated \neverywhere. The culture of peace and coexistence \nthat we are trying to attain in Indonesia and in the \nASEAN region is clearly the antidote to the poison \nof fundamentalist prejudice and deep intolerance, as \npractised by a terrorist group in Iraq and Syria that \nfalsely defines itself as the Islamic State. The ideology \nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant not only \nbetrays the true teaching of Islam as a religion of peace \nbut also harms and seriously upsets the Islamic Ummah \nthroughout the world.\n\nIt has been a great privilege to forge closer bonds \nbetween Indonesia and all nations represented in this \ngreat assembly, the United Nations. As I look back, \nI must admit that there remain many challenges that \nIndonesia must resolve. Some of our efforts are already \non the right track. In a world desperately grappling \nwith climate change, we are progressively and boldly \napplying a moratorium on deforestation \u2014 our \nimportant contribution to reducing carbon emission. In \na world of economic uncertainty, we have increased our \nnational income per capita by 400 per cent within just \na short decade.\n\n\nIn a world witnessing rising extremism, Indonesia \ncontinues to hold firm to the values of freedom, \ntolerance, moderation and multiculturalism, which \nform the basis of our nationhood. In a world still \nburdened by insurgencies, we have managed to find \na permanent peaceful political solution to end the \n30-year conflict in Aceh province. In a world marked \nby turbulent transitions in the Middle East, time and \nagain we have shown to our people and to the world \nthat, in Indonesia, democracy, Islam, modernity and \nhuman rights go together.\n\nIn a world often stigmatized by the past, Indonesia \nhas opened a entire new chapter of peaceful relations \nwith Timor-Leste on the basis on equality and mutual \nrespect. In a world where territorial disputes often \nerupt into open conflicts, Indonesia has continued to \npeacefully resolve, one by one, the overlapping maritime \nborders with Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore and \nother nations.\n\nThe Indonesian and South-East Asian experiences \nunderscore the dawn of a new age of globalism for the \ntwenty-first century \u2014 a world that openly embraces \nchange as opposed to being intimidated by it. What the \nworld so desperately needs today is a pioneering spirit: \nthe boldness to break old boundaries and to create new \nfrontiers. Given that spirit, I believe that humankind \ncan overcome the challenge of climate change, conquer \npoverty, eradicate social injustice, hasten the global \neconomic recovery and create a culture of peace among \nall religions, including the Abrahamic faiths. In that \nspirit, we can, hopefully, end the cycle of violence, \nhatred, fear and humiliation that has made so many \nconflicts around the world seem intractable for decades \nand centuries.\n\nIn saying that, I am neither a Utopian nor a blind \nidealist in understanding international relations. \nHowever, I believe that, with a strong commitment and \npolitical will, we can make the impossible possible. As \nwe say in Indonesia, where there is a will, there is a \nway. We must drive the frontiers of nationalism into \na new globalism, where we can devise solutions to \nnational, regional and global issues at the same time. \nWe must achieve a new globalism, where no nation is \nleft behind and no nation dominates and where rights \nare protected and responsibilities are met. In the world \nof a new globalism, wars are unthinkable. In the first \nplace, wars are fought because nations play a zero-\nsum game, where the winners take all and the losers \nweep \u2014 the game of us against them, which the \u201cus\u201d \nmust win and the \u201cthem\u201d must lose. Winners today are \nlosers tomorrow.\n\nLet me conclude by saying that now is the time for \nall of us to start the serious business of building a new \nworld of peace, prosperity and justice and of making \neverybody a winner by creating and nurturing the new \nall-inclusive \u201cwe\u201d that leaves no one behind.\n"

Military interference has become a \nnorm, despite the dismal outcome of all the operations \ninvolving the use of force that the United States has \ncarried out in recent years.\n\nThe sustainability of the international system has \nbeen severely shaken by the NATO bombardment of \nYugoslavia, the intervention in Iraq, the attack against \nLibya and the failure in Afghanistan. It was due only \nto intensive diplomatic efforts that aggression against \nSyria was prevented in 2013. The various colour \nrevolutions and other schemes aimed at changing \n\n\nunsuitable regimes inevitably give the impression that \ntheir goal is to create chaos and instability.\n\nToday Ukraine has fallen victim to that policy. \nThe situation there has revealed the deep-rooted and \nsystemic flaws remaining in the existing Euro-Atlantic \narchitecture.

The Western partners did not heed our \nnumerous warnings with regard to the unacceptable \nviolations of the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations and the Helsinki Final Act, and time and again \nthey have avoided serious joint work to establish a \ncommon space of equal and indivisible security and \ncooperation from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans.\n\nThe Russian proposal to draft a European security \ntreaty was rejected. We were told directly that only the \nmembers of the North Atlantic Alliance can have legally \nbinding security guarantees, and the NATO expansion \nto the East continued in spite of the promises to the \ncontrary given earlier. NATO\u2019s instant switch to hostile \nrhetoric and the reduction of its cooperation with Russia, \neven to the detriment of the West\u2019s own interests, and \nthe additional build-up of military infrastructure along \nRussia\u2019s borders revealed the inability of the Alliance \nto change the genetic code embedded in it during the \nCold War.\n\nThe United States and the European Union supported \nthe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ukraine, recklessly justifying any \nacts by the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities, who \nopted to suppress by force that part of the Ukrainian \npeople who had rejected the attempts to impose an \nanti-constitutional order throughout the country and \nwanted to defend their rights to their native language, \nculture and history. It is precisely the aggressive assault \non those rights that compelled the population of Crimea \nto take its destiny in its own hands and make a choice \nin favour of self-determination. That was an absolutely \nfree choice, no matter what was invented by those \nwho were responsible in the first place for the internal \nconflict in Ukraine.\n\nThere have been attempts to distort the truth and \nhide facts behind blanket accusations at all stages of the \nUkrainian crisis. Nothing has been done to track down \nand prosecute those responsible for the bloody February \nevents at Maidan and the massive loss of human lives \nin Odessa, Mariupol and other regions of Ukraine. The \nscale of the appalling humanitarian disaster provoked \nby the acts of the Ukrainian army in south-eastern \nUkraine has been deliberately understated.\n\nRecently, horrifying new facts came to light when \nmass graves were discovered near Donetsk. Despite \nSecurity Council resolution 2166 (2014), a thorough \nand independent investigation into the circumstances \nof the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over \nUkrainian territory has been delayed. Those guilty for \nall those crimes must be found and brought to justice. \nOtherwise, national reconciliation in Ukraine can \nhardly be expected.\n\nRussia is sincerely interested in the restoration of \npeace in a neighbouring country, and that should be well \nunderstood by anyone even slightly acquainted with the \ndeep-rooted and fraternal relations between the two \npeoples. The path to a political settlement is known. \nAs early as this April, Kyiv made a commitment in the \nGeneva Statement on Ukraine \u2014 agreed upon by Russia, \nUkraine, the United States and the European Union \n(EU) \u2014 to immediately start a nation-wide dialogue \ninvolving all of Ukraine\u2019s regions and political forces \nto implement constitutional reforms. The fulfilment \nof that obligation would allow all Ukrainians to agree \non how to live in accordance with their traditions and \nculture and would allow Ukraine to return to its organic \nrole as a link between the different parts of the European \nspace, which certainly implies the preservation and \nrespect by everyone of its non-aligned, neutral status. \nWe are convinced that with goodwill and the refusal \nto support the party of war in Kyiv, which is trying to \npush the Ukrainian people into the abyss of national \ncatastrophe, a way out of the crisis is within reach.\n\nA way to overcome the situation has opened with \na ceasefire agreement for south-eastern Ukraine on \nthe basis of initiatives of Presidents Poroshenko and \nPutin. With the participation of representatives of Kyiv, \nDonetsk, Luhansk, the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Russia, practical \nmeasures are being agreed on for the consecutive \nrealization of those agreements, including the separation \nof the parties, the withdrawal of the heavy weapons of \nthe Ukrainian military forces and of the militias, and \nthe organization of monitoring through the OSCE.\n\n\nRussia is ready to continue to actively promote a \npolitical settlement, both under the framework of the \nwell-known recommendations of the Minsk process \nand in other formats. But it should be quite clear that \nwe are doing this for the sake of peace, tranquillity \nand the well-being of the Ukrainian people, and not to \nappease someone\u2019s ambitions. Attempts to put pressure \non Russia to force it to abandon its values of truth and \njustice are absolutely futile.\n\nI will allow myself a digression into recent history. \nAs a condition for the establishment of diplomatic \nrelations with the Soviet Union in 1933, the United \nStates Government demanded from Moscow guarantees \nof non-interference in the internal affairs of the United \nStates, obligations not to undertake any actions aimed at \nchanging the political and social structure of America. \nAt that time, Washington feared the revolutionary virus, \nand such guarantees were secured between America \nand the Soviet Union, on the basis of reciprocity.\n\nPerhaps it makes sense to return to that subject \nand reproduce the then demand of the American \nGovernment on a universal scale. Why not adopt a \nGeneral Assembly declaration about the inadmissibility \nof interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign \nStates and non-recognition of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat as a \nmethod of regime change? It is time to fully exclude \nfrom international interaction attempts at illegitimate \npressure by some States against others. The meaningless \nand counterproductive nature of unilateral sanctions is \nobvious in the example of the American blockade of \nCuba.\n\nA policy of ultimatums and a philosophy of \nsuperiority and domination do not meet the needs \nof the twenty-first century; they are in conflict with \nthe objective processes of forming a polycentric, \ndemocratic world order. Russia promotes a positive, \nunifying agenda. We have always been and will be open \nto discussing the most difficult questions, no matter \nhow intractable they may seem at first. We will be \nready to seek a compromise and a balance of interests \nand to agree to exchange concessions, provided only \nthat the conversation is respectful and equitable.\n\nThe Minsk Agreement of 5 and 19 September about \nthe ways out of the Ukrainian crisis and the compromise \nabout the dates of entry into force of the Association \nAgreement between Kyiv and the European Union are \ngood examples to emulate, as is the readiness, at last, \nof Brussels to begin negotiations on establishing a free \ntrade area between the EU and the Customs Union of \nRussia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, as Mr. Putin suggested \nback in January.\n\nRussia has consistently advocated the harmonization \nof integration projects in Europe and Eurasia. \nAgreement on political benchmarks and terms such \nas \u201cconvergence of integration\u201d would be a real \ncontribution to the work of the OSCE on the topic \nof Helsinki+40. Another important aspect of that \nwork would be to launch a pragmatic, de-ideologized \nconversation on politico-military architecture in the \nEuro-Atlantic area, so that not only members of NATO \nand of the Collective Security Treaty Organization but \nall the countries of the region, including Ukraine, the \nRepublic of Moldova and Georgia, would enjoy equal \nand indivisible security and not have to make a false \nchoice of \u201ceither with us, or against us\u201d. New dividing \nlines must not be allowed in Europe, especially because \nin the context of globalization they could become a \nwatershed between the West and the rest of the world.\n\nIt must be stated honestly that no one has a \nmonopoly on the truth; no one can forcibly tailor global \nand regional processes to suit their needs. Today there \nis no alternative to developing consensus on the rules \nof sustainable global governance in the new historical \nconditions, with full respect for the cultural and \ncivilizational diversity of the world and the multiplicity \nof development models. To attain such a consensus \non every issue will be difficult, perhaps tedious. But \nrecognizing that in every State democracy is \u201cthe worst \nform of Government except for all the others\u201d also took \na long time, not until Churchill issued his verdict. It \nis time to recognize the inevitability of that axiom in \ninternational affairs, which currently suffer from a huge \ndeficit of democracy. Of course, someone will have to \nbreak the age-old stereotypes, to abandon claims to \neternal exceptionalism. But there is no other way.\n\nUnited efforts can be built only on the principles of \nmutual respect and mutual consideration of interests, as \nis done, for example, within the Security Council, the \nGroup of 20, the BRICS States of Brazil, Russia, India, \nChina and South Africa, and the Shanghai Cooperation \nCouncil.\n\nThe theory of the advantages of collective work \nare confirmed in practice, for instance, the progress \nin settling the situation concerning the Iranian \nnuclear programme and the successful completion of \nthe chemical demilitarization of Syria. By the way, \nspeaking of chemical weapons, I would like to obtain \nhonest information on the state of Libya\u2019s chemical \n\n\narsenals. We understand that our NATO colleagues, \nhaving bombed the country in violation of Security \nCouncil resolutions, do not want to stir up the disorder \nthey created. However, the problem of uncontrolled \nLibyan chemical arsenals is too serious to turn a blind \neye to. We believe the Secretary-General must show his \nresponsibility in that matter.\n\nThe main thing today is to see the global priorities \nand avoid making them hostage to a one-sided agenda. \nThere is an urgent need to refrain from double \nstandards in approaches to conflict resolution. By \nand large, everybody agrees that the key task is to \nresolutely counter the terrorists, who are trying to \ngain control of increasingly larger areas of Iraq, Syria, \nLibya, Afghanistan and the Sahel-Sahara region. That \nbeing the case, that problem cannot be sacrificed to \nideological schemes or to settle a score. Terrorists, \nwhatever slogans they hide behind, must be outlawed.\n\nAt the same time, of course, the fight against \nterrorism should be based on the solid foundation of \ninternational law. An important stage in that fight \nwas the unanimous adoption of a series of Security \nCouncil resolutions, including those on the issue of \nforeign terrorist fighters. On the other hand, attempts \nto act contrary to the Charter of our Organization \ndo not contribute to the success of joint efforts. The \nfight against terrorists in Syria should be built on \ncooperation with the Syrian Government, which has \nclearly stated its willingness in that regard. Damascus \nhas already demonstrated its ability to cooperate with \nthe international community and to fulfil its obligations \nin the framework of the programme for eliminating its \nchemical weapons.\n\nFrom the very outset of the Arab Spring, Russia \nurged that it not be abandoned to the control of \nextremists, that a united front be created to counter the \ngrowing terrorist threat. We have warned against the \ntemptation to take as allies almost anyone who declared \nhimself an enemy of Bashar Al-Assad, whether \nAl-Qaida, Jabhat Al-Nusra and other fellow travellers \nof regime change, including the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant (ISIL), which today is the focus of \nattention. As they say, better late than never. This is not \nthe first time that Russia is making a real contribution \nto the fight against ISIL and other terrorist groups in \nthe region. We are delivering large-scale supplies of \narms and military equipment to Iraq, Syria and other \nMiddle Eastern and North African countries, and we \nwill continue to support their efforts to suppress the \nterrorists.\n\nThe terrorist threat requires a comprehensive \napproach if we want to eradicate its causes and not \nbe doomed to reacting to the symptoms. ISIL is only \npart of the problem. We propose to organize, under the \nauspices of the Security Council, an in-depth study of \nthe threat of extremism and terrorism in all of their \naspects throughout the Middle East and North African \nregion. That integrated approach also presupposes \nthat chronic conflicts should be considered, above \nall the Arab-Israeli conflict. The failure to settle the \nPalestinian issue over several decades remains, as is \nwidely recognized, one of the main factors of instability \nin the region, and that helps extremists to recruit more \nand more new jihadists.\n\nAnother area of our common work together \ndemanding attention is uniting our efforts to implement \nthe decisions of the General Assembly and Security \nCouncil to combat the Ebola virus. Our doctors are \nalready working in Africa. There are plans to send \nadditional humanitarian assistance, medical equipment \nand instruments, medicine and teams of experts to assist \nthe United Nations programmes in Guinea, Liberia and \nSierra Leone.\n\nThe United Nations was established on the ruins \nof the Second World War, and it is entering the year \nof its seventieth anniversary. We all have an obligation \nto celebrate in an appropriate manner the anniversary \nof the great victory and to pay tribute to the memory \nof all who perished for freedom and the right of each \npeople to determine their own destiny. The lessons \nof that terrible war and the entire course of events in \ntoday\u2019s world require us to join efforts and forget about \nunilateral interests and national electoral cycles when \nit comes to countering global threats to all humankind. \nNational egoism should not be allowed to prevail over \ncollective responsibility.\n"

        "file_text": "Kamalesh Sharma, the \nSecretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations, \nsaid to us at a gathering here in New York a few days \nago: \u201cDo not be demoralized by your income, be \ninspired by your outcome\u201d. That should be a driving \nprinciple as all countries, particularly the small island \ndeveloping States, seek to determine what the post-\n2015 development agenda will be. The obstacles are \nmany. The lip service is evident. We have hope, and our \nmoral case is strong. We are inspired by the potential \noutcomes of this new development agenda.\n\nWe must be people-focused and, in that regard, I \nremember a story told by a colleague, a Minister from \nthe Far East, who explained his absence to a constituent \nat home as dealing with many of the world\u2019s problems. \n\u201cYes\u201d, said the constituent to him, \u201cbut the water pump \nin the village has not been fixed\u201d. It is a reminder \nof whom we really work for in this body \u2014 not for \nourselves, but for that villager who needs the pump at \nhome to be fixed.\n\nAt this session, our Prime Minister gave a \ncomprehensive statement on climate change and the \nneed for developed countries to honour their financial \ncommitments in that regard. In addition, we deposited \nour instrument of ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty \n(ATT), which helped to bring the number of countries \nto 50 and so caused the Treaty to enter into force. \nFurthermore, in the margins of the session, we signed \na memorandum of understanding with the International \nOrganization for Migration.\n\nThere are no higher priorities for the Bahamas than \nthese matters: the environment, fighting crime and \ncontaining illegal immigration. They go to the very \nroot of our existence. If we do not resolve the climate \nchange issues, there will be no Bahamas. Solving the \ncrime problem in the Bahamas is key to our domestic \npeace and economic survivability. No Bahamian doubts \nthat the control of illegal immigration is central to \nour survivability as a country, central to our national \nidentity, and central to our national security. We have \nonly to see today how illegal immigration drains our \nfinancial resources, and we do not have to look far to \nsee how unchecked immigration in other countries has \nbeen a recipe for civil strife within their borders. We \ndo not intend for that to happen to us. All of the efforts \nrelated to the three main themes I have just mentioned \nare buttressed by our work to ensure that we have a \nrobust, strong and sustainable economy.\n\nTourism is by far the number-one economic \nactivity for the Bahamas. The environment is central \nto that business. It should therefore be no surprise that \nthe Bahamas has adopted or established the following: \nthe National Environmental Policy, 2005; the National \nEnvironmental Management and Action Plan for the \nBahamas, 2005; the Bahamas National Wetland Policy, \n2007; the Bahamas Protected Areas Fund, 2013; and \nthe Forestry Amendment Act, 2014. We believe that \nthose policies and programmes will all help with the \nissue of climate change. We also believe that the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change is \nthe primary international, intergovernmental forum for \nnegotiating the global response to climate change. We \nbelieve that it should be completed with dispatch.\n\nThe Bahamas is committed to the small island \ndeveloping States processes at the United Nations. \nThe Bahamas welcomes the convening of the World \nConference on Disaster Risk Reduction next year in \nJapan.\n\nThe Bahamas is appalled by the practice of killing \nsharks simply for their fins. We must make the fishing \nof sharks a sustainable practice, as these creatures \nare a vital part of the global ecosystem. The Bahamas \n\n\ntherefore assumed the chairmanship of the United \nNations Save Our Sharks Coalition in December 2013. \nThe aims of the Coalition resonate with us, and we \nbelieve that we can help save the shark from extinction.\n\nThe Bahamas has been grappling with serious \ncrimes in our society, related largely to, first, the \ninability of young males to settle disputes without \nrecourse to violence and, secondly, the resulting \nproliferation of gang activity and trafficking in illicit \ndrugs, small arms and light weapons, and ammunition. \nThe Bahamas therefore became actively involved in \nthe negotiations leading to the successful adoption of \nthe Arms Trade Treaty and considered its adoption \na landmark accomplishment for the United Nations \n(resolution 67/234 B). The Government believes the \nentry into force of the ATT will contribute to peace \nand security in the Bahamas and throughout our \nregion. We deposited the instrument of ratification of \nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas to the Arms Trade \nTreaty on 25 September. We continue to fight the \nillegal drug trade and trafficking in persons, and we are \ninvesting in social intervention programmes, like the \naward-winning Urban Renewal Programme, in order to \nfight crime.\n\nI spoke earlier of the memorandum of understanding \nsigned with the International Organization for \nMigration. This is one part of a multifaceted strategy \nto stop the flow of undocumented non-nationals into \nBahamian territory. New policies and measures are \nnow in place, and there will be stricter adherence in \nthe future to them to stop this trafficking. A new fleet \nof vessels has been purchased to support our work to \nstop migrant smuggling. In the last few months, the \nBahamas has entered into important agreements with \nour immediate neighbours \u2014 Cuba, the Dominican \nRepublic and Haiti \u2014 to come to terms with the vexing \nsituations that impact our good relations. Those accords \nare on fishing and on migration. Let there be no doubt \nthat we mean to bring illegal migration under control.\n\nNevertheless, our relations with neighbouring \ncountries remain good. This is all the more reason \nwhy we believe that the continued economic embargo \nby one neighbour against another in our region is \ncounterproductive to the peace and good order of the \nregion. We continue to keep matters with regard to \nthe governance issues in our neighbour, the Turks and \nCaicos Islands, under review.\n\nThe Bahamas looks forward to the forthcoming \nlaunch of the International Decade for People of African \nDescent, which will have as its theme \u201cPeople of \nAfrican descent: recognition, justice and development\u201d. \nThat theme could also be linked to the efforts of States \nmembers of the Caribbean Community in seeking the \nrestorative justice due from the legacy of 400 years \nof slavery. We were heartened by the unveiling of the \nwinning design for the permanent memorial to honour \nthe victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. \nWe reaffirm our support for that important project.\n\nThe Bahamas welcomes the convening of the third \nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \nto be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in July 2015. We \nplan to participate in that conference, which we expect \nwill provide a forum to address the need to demystify \nand replace the view that gross domestic product \nis the sole indicator of sustainable development \u2014 a \nreplacement that needs to be converted into policy \u2014 as \nwell as the matter of international cooperation in tax \nmatters. In that regard, the Bahamas reaffirms the \nimportant role of the United Nations in addressing \nmatters related to international tax cooperation, given \nits universality and legitimacy.\n\nThe Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to \nthe promotion and protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms for all people, regardless of their \nstation or status in society. These rights and freedoms \nare neither negotiable nor peripheral. As a demonstration \nof its commitment to human rights, I am pleased to \nreport that the Bahamas has passed national legislation, \nthe Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities) \nAct, which will ensure its ratification of the Convention \non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in due \ncourse. In addition, four bills have been introduced in \nParliament with a view to amending the Constitution of \nthe Bahamas to bring about full equality between men \nand women in law. This event will mark a significant \nopportunity for the people of the Bahamas to usher in a \nnew era of equality for men and women.\n\nThe Bahamas looks forward to the process of \nelaborating the post-2015 development agenda and to \nactively participating in the intergovernmental process \nthat will lead to the adoption of this agenda in September \n2015. Our vision for the post-2015 development agenda \nis creative, inclusive and transformative.\n\nThe Bahamas endorses the idea of Security Council \nreform. As we look around at the tens of millions of \ndollars that have been, and are being, spent to bring the \nphysical structure up to code and into the twenty-first \ncentury, why cannot we ensure that the organs of the \n\n\nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, also \nreflect twenty-first-century realities?\n\nLast year, the Bahamas celebrated its fortieth year \nof independence. In addressing the General Assembly \nlast year (see A/68/PV.19), the Right Honourable Perry \nChristie, Prime Minister of the Bahamas, renewed \nthe commitment of our country to playing its part in \nmaking our planet a more peaceful and prosperous \nplace, characterized by cooperation, mutual respect and \nsupport. We believe that each country has a primary \nresponsibility for its own development, and, throughout \nmy statement, I have indicated our achievements and \nchallenges in that regard. I repeat that the environment, \ncrime and illegal migration are issues of existential \nsignificance to our country. However, despite the many \nchallenges, we are inspired by the possible outcomes. \nWe therefore exhort the Members of the United Nations \nto stay motivated and committed, for each new effort \nundertaken and each achievement registered brings us \nnearer to our development goals. Now, more than ever, \nwe need the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Fourteen years \nago, in this very Hall, the international community, in a \npromising move, pledged to attain a series of common \ngoals by 2015, essentially, to eradicate poverty and \nachieve a prosperous and shared world in a secure \nenvironment. Now, one year before that deadline, we \nmust recognize that humankind has not been able to \ncreate all the conditions necessary for the development \nwe aspire to. The very foundations of our Organization \nare likely to be shaken if steps are not taken to deal with \nthe immense challenges facing us.\n\nPoverty always goes hand in hand with major \npandemics, undermining any glimmer of hope for \nthe decent life to which our people are entitled. \nHumankind\u2019s aggressiveness towards the environment \npushes it out of the balance that is essential for its \ngrowth and for sustainable development. Fundamental \nrights are still being trampled on, opening the door to \nintolerance, frustrations and social crises. Peace and \nsecurity are faltering in many countries, threatening \nmore than ever the stability of our planet. It is clear that \nonly a comprehensive and cooperative approach will \nlead us to a society free of the defects that prevent true \nprogress.\n\nIn congratulating the President of the Assembly on \nhis election, we would like to state that he is without \na doubt contributing to the momentum for a new \nglobal partnership, which we have all been hoping \nfor and which is so crucial. Today, we wish to assure \nhim that we will provide him with the same kind of \nunfailing support that we provided to his predecessor, \nAmbassador John Ashe, to whom we pay tribute for \nhis leadership in seeking solutions to our issues of \nconcern. I must address the issue of the serious health \nand humanitarian crisis that Sierra Leone, Liberia and \nGuinea are currently facing. As members know, the \nEbola virus, a disease characterized by haemorrhagic \nfever, continues to threaten international security. \nSince its most recent appearance in March 2014, it \nhas caused over 2,500 deaths and continues to cause \nvictims. Health-care workers have not been spared.\n\nFaced with the spread of the epidemic, an \nextraordinary summit of heads of State and Government \nof the Mano River Union was held in Conakry on \n1 August. The summit adopted a common strategy \nfor fighting the disease and made an urgent appeal to \nthe international community for a coordinated global \nresponse. At the national level, my Government declared \na health emergency on 13 August. The quarantine line \nwas reinforced by the establishment of compulsory \nmedical checks at all border crossings and crossing \nplaces in the country, in particular airports and ports.\n\nThe negative impact of the Ebola virus on the \ncountry\u2019s economy can be seen in the decrease in trade, \nproductivity and activity in the transport, investment \nand tourism sectors. To date, Guinea has suffered a loss \nof nearly 2.5 per cent in the growth forecast for gross \ndomestic product. That loss could increase if adequate \nmeasures are not taken in time to stem the epidemic. \nThere have been other adverse consequences for the \naffected countries, in particular in terms of borders \nbeing closed, the free movement of persons hindered, \nflights cancelled and nationals of the States affected by \nthe disease stigmatized.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic reminds us of the urgent need \nfor a comprehensive approach to contain and defeat this \nterrible disease. We must isolate Ebola, not countries. \nWe must counter the irrational panic that has gripped \nthe world. Ebola is a very serious epidemic, but it is not \na death sentence. Ebola can be cured.\n\n\nWe therefore welcome the fact that several African \nHeads of State have joined President Ibrahim Boubacar \nKeita of Mali and the King of Morocco, to whom I pay \ntribute, and France and England, as President Alassane \nOuattara of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, President Teodoro Obiang \nNguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, President \nDenis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of Congo and \nPresident Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon have decided \nto lift the ban on flights and the use of airports. I thank \nthem.\n\nIn my capacity as Acting Chair of the Mano River \nUnion, I would like to welcome the appointment of \nthe United Nations System Senior Coordinator for \nEbola Virus Disease and pay tribute to the work of \nthe World Health Organization, the United States \nCenters for Disease Control in Atlanta, M\u00e9decins \nsans Fronti\u00e8res, the International Federation of Red \nCross and Red Crescent Societies and other bilateral \nand multilateral partners who are sparing no effort to \nsupport coordinated action by the affected countries to \neradicate the Ebola virus.\n\nMy Government welcomes with genuine satisfaction \nSecurity Council resolution 2177 (2014), which was \nco-sponsored by 134 Member States and adopted \nunanimously by the members of the Council, and \nresolution 69/1, on the establishment of a United \nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. I \nwelcome the spirit of solidarity that continues to be \nshown to the countries affected by the epidemic and \nexpress our gratitude to all States and organizations \nthat have assisted us. I thank in particular President \nObama, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the Secretary-\nGeneral for their support and their call to action to all \nthe countries of the world.\n\nOur countries have urgent needs that must be met \nto further boost our efforts to fight effectively against \nEbola. Those needs are in a variety of areas, including \nstrengthening our infrastructure and health systems \nand increasing the number of health-care workers and \nfinancial, material and logistical support, as the gaps in \nthose areas inhibit our efforts. Promises are nice, but \nthere is an urgent need for action on the ground. The \nfaster we act, the better chance we have of stopping the \ndisease.\n\nSustainable development remains the cornerstone \nof the harmonious development of humankind. The \ninternational community has an obligation to end the \npoverty that still grips almost 2 billion people, most of \nwhom live in Africa. Beyond the economic and social \nconcerns, it is a matter of human dignity. It is a matter \nof justice and fairness. We therefore do not have the \nright to back off, much less to give up.\n\nCertainly, progress has been made, if unevenly, \ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \nIlliteracy has been pushed back, although efforts \nare still needed to achieve the quality and equality \nrequired in the pursuit of knowledge. The essential \nrole of women in transforming society has been further \nenhanced. However, family health and access to water, \nbasic health care and social protection deserve further \ninvestment and political commitment. Worse, the \ndigital divide has been slow to show any improvement, \nfor lack of an adequate policy of ownership or transfers \nof science and new technologies. However, encouraging \nresults have been achieved in the fight against malaria \nand HIV/AIDS despite the spectre of the disease, which \nstill haunts the lives of millions of people who do not \nhave access to antiretroviral medicine.\n\nThe many challenges facing our world require an \nurgent, comprehensive and coordinated response. In \nthe collective quest for well-being, Africa in particular \nhas seen renewed growth, but it is having difficulty \nin translating that growth into a true engine for \ndevelopment. Eradicating poverty is an uphill battle. \nThe new Africa that we aspire to should promote \nstructural changes that enable it to acquire robust and \ndiversified economies so as to guarantee reinvestment \nin value-added and environmentally friendly industries \nin future.\n\nIn that context, the Climate Summit held on the \nsidelines of the current session has provided hope that a \nbinding agreement will be adopted at the international \nconference to be held in Paris in 2015. It goes without \nsaying that those measures will build on the foundation \nof a vibrant private sector that is underpinned by strong \ninstitutions that guarantee good governance, which is \nitself the crucible of inclusive development.\n\nThat is why, despite the backdrop of a relentless \nsystemic crisis and the scarcity of external resources \nbecause of unfulfilled commitments, Africa will be able \nto enter into the international system, gain confidence \nand increase intra-African trade to influence the flow of \nworld trade. That is also why our continent will, relying \nprimarily on its own strength \u2014 and that is extremely \nimportant \u2014 be able to become less vulnerable and \nbuild resilience through coherent strategies and the \nsearch for innovative financing to accelerate its full \npotential.\n\n\nRecognizing all those challenges, Guinea has made \na decisive commitment to promoting democracy and \nthe rule of law, which are the foundation for sustainable \ndevelopment. In doing so, since our assumption of the \ncountry\u2019s leadership in 2010 we have taken measures \nthat affect all areas of our national life. The reform \nof the defence and security sector ensures that our \narmed forces are at the service of the Republic and \nincreases their participation in the development process \nand in peacekeeping in the world. The independence \nof the judiciary is now ensured. Our stabilized and \ncompetitive macroeconomic framework strengthens \nGuinea\u2019s credibility at the international level.\n\nGuinea has been admitted to the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative and today has one of \nthe most attractive mining codes. Even better, the review \nof all contracts allows us to make the environment safer \nfor investors and ensures a development process that \nbenefits Guineans while preserving our ecosystem.\n\nOf course, the development of the mining sector \nwill rely on promoting agriculture to ensure our food \nsecurity and to pass on to future generations the \nresources needed to shape to the world they hope for. \nThe growth we aspire to will be even more promising \nas it creates decent jobs for our youth and empowers \nwomen \u2014 two sectors of society that constitute the rich \nand inexhaustible source of all progress.\n\nOur unquenchable desire to ensure the well-being of \nour people can be fulfilled only in a stable environment \nthat is free from crises and conflicts. Multilateralism, \nwhich is the only way to realize our goals, is imperative, \nsince our States, whether big or small, strong or weak, \nare determined to contribute to building a more just \nand equitable global society within a reformed United \nNations that is responsive to the needs of humanity. \nIn that context, Africa, the continent that is the most \naffected, will shoulder its responsibilities by pooling \nits efforts through greater regional integration, which \nis an essential element of a global partnership leading \nto a more dynamic and pragmatic peace.\n\nThat is why we must be more involved in the \nstruggle against terrorism, extremism and intolerance \nand the illicit trafficking in small arms and light \nweapons, which fuel cross-border crime and maritime \ninsecurity \u2014 the numerous scourges that hinder \ndevelopment. The time has come to be the true builders \nof our destiny. The rule of law, respect for all human \nrights and good governance remain intangible realities \nthat we must promote. Likewise, the implementation \nof the African Peace and Security Architecture and \nthe ability of Africa to respond quickly to crises will \nstrengthen our credibility with regard to stabilizing the \ncontinent.\n\nI should like to stress in particular the unacceptable \nsuffering that our Palestinian brothers are experiencing. \nGuinea has always clearly and unambiguously expressed \nits unconditional solidarity with the just Palestinian \ncause and firmly condemns the heinous acts committed \nby Israel in the Gaza Strip, which is now suffering \nunder the yoke of a cruel and vile embargo. My country \nremains convinced that any viable and lasting solution \nto the situation in the Middle East hinges on the \ncreation of two States living side by side within secure \nand internationally recognized borders, based on the \npre-1967 borders.\n\nWe will soon have the opportunity to take stock of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. On the eve of that \nmeeting and bearing in mind that we decided, at our \nsixty-eighth session, to set the stage for the sustainable \ndevelopment goals, it is clear that the implementation \nof those legitimate goals remains dependent both on \nthe appropriate means for its implementation and on \nwhether the priorities of poor countries, in particular \nAfrican countries, are taken into account.\n\nThat is why Guinea, which has a member on the \nSecretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel of Eminent \nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, calls \nfor greater attention to be given to the African Common \nPosition on the post-2015 development agenda. That is \nall the more relevant since, if Africa does well, the world \nwill do better. The new Africa \u2014 more ambitious and \nmore promising and aware of its human and economic \npotential \u2014 is now ready to assume its responsibilities.\n\nI again thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \nwho has devoted all his actions and energy into forging \nan adequate response on the part of the United Nations \nto all the challenges we face. He deserves our gratitude \nand respect. There is no doubt that his efforts will \nchart the course for the indispensable reform of the \ninternational system, so that the United Nations will be \ntrue to its original objectives of promoting peace and \nsecurity and respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms in a world of democracy, equity and progress \nfor all.\n"

        "file_text": "Despite our \naspirations to create a more just and peaceful world, \natrocities continue to take place. Every day we witness \nexpressions of the darker side of human nature: \nthousands of innocent civilians besieged on a mountain \nin northern Iraq by heavily armed extremists; a Syrian \ndictator who bombs and starves his own people, \nleaving more than 10 million people in need of urgent \nhumanitarian assistance; the persecution of people \nbecause of their religious or political beliefs, their \ngender or sexual orientation; disrespect for national \nborders, challenging the basic principles on which our \nrules-based international order is built; climate change \ncausing great risks to human health, global food security \nand economic development and to the natural resources \non which so much of our prosperity depends; and a \nworld of more than 7 billion people with an increasing \ndemand for key resources and an unsustainable pattern \nof consumption and production.\n\nThe challenges we face are complex. There are \nno simple solutions. What is required of us is strong, \ncollective international action, not only to manage \nthe crises and conflicts of today but to prevent the \ncrises and conflicts of tomorrow. I am a true believer \nin international cooperation and in the virtues of the \nUnited Nations, but as the world changes and we are \nfaced with new challenges, we must find new ways to \nadapt.\n\n\nI am also confident that we will adapt, but only if \nwe have a strong United Nations, and only if we act \ntogether. As Member States each one of us must fulfil \nour obligations under the Charter. That is our common \ncommitment and our shared responsibility. I see three \nchallenges where we, the United Nations, should act \nand should act now. Urgency is key.\n\nFirst, we need stronger international cooperation \nand action on peace and security. Secondly, we have to \nreach an ambitious international agreement on climate \nchange next year in Paris. Thirdly, we have to agree on \nthe post-2015 agenda for sustainable development.\n\nOf the three challenges, the first is international \npeace and security. This past year, we have seen the \nrise of a violent and intensifying conflict fuelled by \nextremism, in particular the horrific and brutal terrorist \norganization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL). ISIL represents a distorted political ideology \nthat must be confronted, degraded and defeated by the \nentire international community, including, of course, \ncountries in the region. As we are gathered this week, \n\n\nthe States Members of the United Nations are sending a \nclear message that we utterly condemn ISIL\u2019s cowardly \nacts of terror and that we are unified in our firm \nresolve to oppose and confront its violent and extremist \nideology. Let it be clear that we are determined to \nsupport the Iraqi Government in protecting its people.\n\nDenmark will stand up for our common values as \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, and Denmark \nwill support the victims of ISIL\u2019S atrocities. We are \ntaking part in the humanitarian relief efforts in northern \nIraq, and we will continue our active contribution to the \ninternational efforts to support Iraq in the fight against \nISIL. To stop the advance of ISIL, it is imperative to end \nthe flow of foreign fighters and financing from outside. \nThat indeed is a common obligation. It is also critical \nthat we address the root causes of violent extremism \nand improve the conditions in Syria that ISIL has been \nable to exploit.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Syria continues to be \nof great concern. Though progress is difficult, we must \nspare no effort to seek a political solution leading to a \ntransition from the current regime. There will always \nbe a risk that political transition will be exploited by \nviolent extremists. Still, history shows that democratic \nand inclusive Governments, open societies and a \nfundamental respect for human rights remain the only \nviable path towards stability, security and prosperity \nfor our citizens.\n\nBringing an end to the violence in the region will \nrequire a sustained and comprehensive contribution \nfrom every one of us. The successful removal of \nAl-Assad\u2019s chemical weapons clearly demonstrated \nwhat can be achieved when we join forces in decisive \ninternational action. A coalition of Denmark, Norway, \nRussia, China, Finland, the United Kingdom and the \nUnited States effectively secured and destroyed those \nhorrendous weapons of war.\n\nOur united response is also required against another \ngrowing threat. The Ebola epidemic has become a severe \nhumanitarian, social and economic crisis for countries \nin West Africa. If we fail to act now, it may develop into \na global health crisis, impacting millions of people. If \nso, we will not only be confronted with a health crisis \nbut also with a threat to international peace, prosperity \nand security. It is very clear that this challenge cannot \nbe tackled by any one nation alone. That is why we \nmust all lend our support. The United Nations and its \nMember States have a common responsibility to bring \nEbola under control.\n\nEbola is not just a regional challenge; it has now \nbecome a global crisis. Denmark is committed to that \ncause. We have already contributed to the international \nresponse, including the United Nations humanitarian air \nservice, and we will now increase our support. Today, \nI can announce that Denmark will provide a maritime \ntransport capacity to the United Nations. With that, \nwe will support the construction of needed housing \nfacilities for the international health personnel in the \naffected areas. We will provide additional funding to \nthe World Health Organization. As the situation evolves, \nwe will stand ready to consider additional steps.\n\nThe global community is based on international law. \nThat law must be respected and not blatantly violated, as \nwe have seen done in the past year. We have witnessed \nan unacceptable foreign intervention in Ukraine. \nFundamental principles of national sovereignty and \nnon-interference have been disrespected. The recent \nceasefire is an important step on the only viable way \nforward, namely, a political solution. Yet, we have \nto see Russia\u2019s commitment to a political solution \ndemonstrated in action, not only in words. Throughout \nthe conflict Russia\u2019s self-proclaimed support to the \npeace process has been in stark contrast to realities on \nthe ground.\n\nWe remain fully committed to a political solution \nthat respects Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and \nsovereignty. Respect for international law and human \nrights should always be at the very core of peace \nand development, as should the rule of law and good \ngovernance. That is why Denmark strongly supports \nbold and significant new steps in the United Nations, \nsuch as the Secretary-General\u2019s recent Rights Up Front \ninitiative.\n\nThis year also marks the thirtieth anniversary of \nthe adoption of the United Nations Convention against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment. Together with Chile, Ghana, \nIndonesia and Morocco, Denmark has launched a \nlong-term initiative for the universal ratification and \nimplementation of that Convention. We have made \nsignificant progress, but we also need to do more to \nprotect men and women in all parts of the world from \ntorture and ill-treatment.\n\nMy second point is about the need to advance our \ncollective answer to the challenges posed by climate \nchange. Earlier this year I had the privilege, together \nwith the Premier of Greenland, of hosting a visit by \nthe Secretary-General to Greenland. We travelled \n\n\ntogether by dog sleigh on the receding ice, and we \nheard the stories told by the local population about how \nthe changes are affecting local livelihoods. Climate \nchange is painfully visible in the Arctic. That is beyond \ndiscussion. Let there be no illusion that climate change \nwill have only regional impacts. The changes will affect \neach and every one of us on this planet. That is why \nambitious action is required of us now. One crucial step \nwould be a binding global agreement to reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions in Paris next year.\n\nSince 2010, Denmark has dedicated $350 million \nto climate action. This year alone, we will commit \nmore than $100 million. But Governments cannot do \nthis alone. We need to engage the private sector and \nother partners to commit to action and ensure adequate \nclimate finance and foster innovation and green \nsolutions. Some still might fear that the green transition \nwill limit economic growth. That is not necessarily \nso. For example, the Danish economy has grown \nby 40 per cent since 1990, while our total emissions \nhave decreased by 20 per cent in that same period. In \nother words, it is possible to de-link economic growth \nfrom increased emissions. At the Secretary-General\u2019s \nClimate Summit yesterday, world leaders expressed \ntheir commitment to address those issues. Now is the \ntime to deliver on that commitment.\n\nThe third and final area where Denmark sees an \nurgent need for action is on the post-2015 agenda for \nsustainable development. As stated by the Secretary-\nGeneral: \u201cOurs is the first generation that can wipe \npoverty from the face of the Earth\u201d (A/68/PV.5, p. 1). \nThat is not a message based on wishful thinking. It \nis based on the facts. It is within our reach and it has \nto be done. Over a 20-year period, from 1990-2010, \n700 million people have been lifted out of extreme \npoverty. Child mortality has been reduced by almost \n50 per cent. Ninety per cent of children in developing \nregions now attend primary schools. That represents \ntruly historic progress. But still we need to do more.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals were \nformulated almost 15 years ago, and the world has, as \nwe know, developed rapidly since. Clearly, the new \nset of sustainable development goals must address \nand integrate the economic, social, and environmental \ndimensions of development.\n\nAnother important factor is to ensure women\u2019s \nempowerment, gender equality and the rights of women \nand girls. That includes sexual and reproductive health \nrights. In too many places those fundamental rights are \nstill not observed. Women and young girls must have \nthe right to decide freely whether they want to have \nchildren, when, how many, and with whom.\n\nAll young people must have access to proper \neducation. Two hundred years ago, compulsory \neducation was introduced in my country. Education for \nthe many and not just for the few has been a primary \ndriver in transforming Denmark into a democratic and \nprosperous nation. Education has also been a driver of \ngender equality, and still is. That is one aspect of the \npost-2015 agenda that is particularly close to my heart. \nI have been very proud to be one of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Champions for his Global Education First \nInitiative. One of our key priorities must be to ensure \nquality education also for the most disadvantaged \ngroups and in the most vulnerable countries.\n\nAs we look at the global landscape today, insecurity \nis sadly on the rise. We all know who is paying the \nhighest price. Today for the first time since the Second \nWorld War, more than 50 million people throughout \nthe world have been displaced owing to conflict and \nviolence. Far too many of those people are children.\n\nWe need a United Nations that can help mediate, \nprevent and resolve armed conflicts and promote \nuniversal respect for human rights. We need a United \nNations that is committed to act against climate change. \nAnd we need a United Nations that can help deliver \nsustainable development for all and provide effective \nassistance to countries suffering from the Ebola virus.\n\nBut the United Nations can do nothing without the \ncollective political will of all of us, its Member States. \nThe world needs a United Nations that adapts to new \nchallenges and reflects the changing global political \nrealities. Denmark supports a reformed Security Council \nthat fulfils its primary purpose and responsibility when \npeace and security is threatened. We need a United \nNations based on the strong values and obligations \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. More than \never, we need a United Nations that acts.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate you, \nMr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at this year\u2019s session. I wish also \nto commend your predecessor, Ambassador John Ashe \nof Antigua and Barbuda, and his team, for so effectively \nsetting the stage for what will now follow under your \ntenure, as it relates to the post-2015 development \nagenda and other critical issues that warrant the focused \nattention of the international community.\n\nThis debate in the General Assembly is taking place \non the eve of the target year set by world leaders in \n2000 for achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). It is therefore a timely moment to assess the \nprogress that has been made, and also to understand \nwhy we could not achieve all the Goals in full. That is \nessential if we are to move forward with the post-2015 \nagenda that we are now about to finalize. I should recall \nthat in 2000, when the eight Goals were announced, \nthey inspired great hope and enthusiasm around the \nworld, particularly in developing countries and among \nthe poor. It is true that we have made tangible progress \nin our efforts to achieve the MDGs. Global poverty \nhas fallen and continues to fall; many more children \nare attending primary schools; health services have \nimproved for many people, resulting in a significant \ndecline in child mortality; and the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand malaria has been halted and even reversed in some \nregions.\n\nIn Guyana, despite the negative effects of the \ninternational financial situation, we have managed \nto keep our economy growing steadily over the past \neight years. In fact, we have succeeded not only in \ngrowing our economy but also in ensuring that the \ngrowth has resulted in an improved quality of life for \nour people. Indeed, we are one of only 17 countries \nin the world recognized by the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations for not only \nmeeting the goal of reducing hunger by half but also of \nimproving their people\u2019s nutrition. We have achieved \nuniversal primary education and are close to achieving \nuniversality for secondary education, too. We have also \nmade important strides in housing, health, water and \nother social facilities. In that regard, I would like to \nexpress my country\u2019s gratitude to all the development \npartners that have contributed greatly to the gains we \nhave made in working towards the MDGs. Guyana\u2019s \nsuccess in building its health-sector capacity could not \nhave been possible without Cuba\u2019s assistance, which \nincluded training hundreds of our doctors, and which \nCuba has done despite its own economic difficulties. \nWe would like to join the vast majority of the countries \nof the world in once more calling for an end to Cuba\u2019s \neconomic blockade by the United States.\n\nWhile we should recognize the gains that have been \nmade around the world, I hasten to point out that they \nhave not been uniform across countries or regions. In \nsome places the progress has been dramatic. Asia, for \ninstance, has had remarkable success with many of the \nGoals. In Latin America and the Caribbean there has \nalso been considerable progress. There are, however, \nsome areas that have seen almost no noticeable change \nsince 2000. In others, mainly countries ravaged by \nconflicts and wars, laudable gains have been reversed. \nSome Goals have also proven more elusive than others. \nMaternal mortality in particular requires additional \nattention. It is clear that the world could have advanced \nmuch further along the road to achieving the MDGs. \nUnfortunately, that did not happen, because the \npartnership needed to achieve every objective was \nnot strong enough. We should therefore examine the \nreasons for the sub-optimal results.\n\n\nIt is true that we all have a responsibility for the \nwelfare of the people of the world and the state of our \nplanet in general. The reality, however, is that some \ncountries have far more resources than others, and \nsome also use much more of the world\u2019s resources. \nAnd while our responsibilities are shared, they must \nnecessarily be differentiated. The gaps between the \ntop and bottom segments of the world\u2019s population \nare widening greatly. The concentration of wealth in \nthe hands of a few has reached dangerous proportions. \nOxfam International recently highlighted this \nphenomenon, and some figures are startling. Oxfam \nnoted that the richest 1 per cent of the population of the \nworld owns about 46 per cent of global wealth \u2014 some \n$110 trillion \u2014 while the bottom 50 per cent owns just \nabout $1.7 trillion, or 0.7 per cent of the world\u2019s wealth. \nThat amount, $1.7 trillion, is the same as that possessed \nby 85 of the world\u2019s richest people \u2014 in other words, \n85 persons have as much wealth as 50 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s population. Clearly, such a degree of inequality \nis unsustainable.\n\nIn much the same manner, while we have all agreed \non increasing development assistance to developing \ncountries, the reality is that the net transfer of financial \nresources from developing to developed countries \ncontinues unabated, amounting to $200 billion in 2002 \nand increasing to $557 billion in 2010. That perverse \ntrend continues today. And this transfer of financial \nresources is only a part of the picture. Developing \ncountries also suffer a net loss of skills to the developed \nworld through migration. That is after the former \ncountries have expended huge amounts on training. \nIn addition, our efforts in the health and education \nsectors are often frustrated by the high costs of school \nbooks and essential medicines, owing to the strictures \nof intellectual property rights. These imbalances \nare clearly unsustainable and can be addressed only \nthrough concerted global action.\n\nWhile many developing countries have shown \nserious determination in working towards the Goals \nby allocating more resources to human development, \nthe support offered to them by developed countries, as \nenvisaged in MDG 8, has fallen significantly short of \nexpectations. It is extremely disappointing, to say the \nleast, that in the face of pressing needs, only about half \na dozen developed countries have kept their pledge to \nreserve 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for \nofficial development assistance. As we prepare for yet \nanother conference on financing for development, in \nEthiopia next year, I would like to remind the Assembly \nthat the commitment of 0.7 per cent was made over four \ndecades ago in this very Assembly, and was reiterated \nin 2002 at the International Conference on Financing \nfor Development in Monterrey.\n\nIn the light of those failures, it is imperative that \nthe post-2015 framework include, first, a time-bound \ncommitment for delivering official development \nassistance on which commitments have already been \nmade; secondly, a global framework for managing \nintellectual property rights that places the development \nimperative at its centre; thirdly, a global trading \narchitecture that recognizes the asymmetries in the \nglobal state of development and is suitably responsive \nto them; fourthly, a framework that ensures that \nprivate-sector investment is consistent with the \ndevelopment agenda. The recommendations of the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals and of the Intergovernmental Committee of \nExperts on Sustainable Development Financing provide \na good platform on which to build.\n\nAs we craft a transformative agenda, it will be \nespecially important to ensure that it is flexible enough \nto address the peculiar needs of some countries. The \nspecial circumstances occasioned by the vulnerabilities \nof small island and low-lying coastal developing States \nbear particular mention in that regard. Far too often, \nthe progress made can be speedily reversed owing to \nthe impacts of climate change and natural disasters. We \nmust spare no effort to ensure that we have a legally \nbinding agreement on this matter in 2015.\n\nIronically, as we discuss the post-2015 development \nagenda, many Caribbean Community countries are \nbeing graduated from eligibility for concessionary \nfinancing, since they are classified as middle-income \nbased on the narrow measure of gross domestic product \nper capita. In addition, many of those countries are \nheavily indebted, as they must make unavoidable \ninvestments in building and rebuilding social, economic \nand productive infrastructure to strengthen their \nresilience. We call on the international community \nto reconsider that approach by adding a vulnerability \nindex to the equation. We also call for debt relief, as \nthe debt accumulated by most of those countries makes \ntheir economies unsustainable.\n\nThe most important precondition for progress \nis peace. Many conflicts and potential for conflicts \ncontinue unresolved, while new threats to global \nsecurity have risen to dangerous levels.\n\n\nThe situation in the Middle East is the most \ndisturbing. Still at the heart of it is the great tragedy \nthat is the plight of the Palestinian people. Once again, \nwe have seen the bombing of an almost unarmed \npopulation in Gaza by one of the world\u2019s most powerful \nmilitary machines, supported and replenished by even \nmore powerful military forces. Guyana calls for the end \nof the apartheid-like situation that exists in Palestine, \nwhere poverty and degradation are weapons used to \nrepress a whole people. The people of Palestine have a \nright to live with dignity in their own country, and the \nUnited Nations must never compromise on the principle \nof self-determination.\n\nThe continuing wars in Syria and Iraq are most \ndistressing. They are leading to more extremism and \na rapid descent into barbarism. That has resulted from \nyears of financing and arming of radical forces to \npromote political objectives. We condemn the barbaric \nand grotesque killing of journalists, humanitarian aid \nworkers and other hostages and the loss of civilian lives \nin those conflict areas by the murderous extremists in \nthose countries. Guyana condemns terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine is another cause for \nconcern. We must not forget that the two world wars \nhad their origins in Europe. That is why we should \nexert every effort to bring all the partners to the table \nfor a peaceful resolution. Attempting to secure military \nadvantages is not only foolhardy but downright \ndangerous. The solution has to be based on justice and \nthe aspirations of the peoples in that country.\n\nThe many unresolved border issues that exist in \nour world are always a potential source of conflict and \nare often used to retard the development of countries, \npreventing them from improving the quality of life of \ntheir own peoples and from promoting the welfare of \nthe region to which they belong. My own country is not \nunaffected by this. The United Nations must therefore \nredouble its efforts to assist in the resolution of such \nissues.\n\nWe currently face a stark reminder of how fragile \nglobal welfare is in the face of singular threats such as \nthe Ebola epidemic. Make no mistake, that is a global \nproblem that requires an immediate global response \nmany times greater what is currently being done. Let \nme acknowledge the prompt response and leadership \nshown by Cuba and the United States of America in \nrendering assistance to the countries in West Africa.\n\nIn our time, we must continue the search for new \napproaches to many of the global problems that confront \nus. In today\u2019s interconnected and interdependent world, \nthe destinies of States and peoples are increasingly \nintertwined. The concerted global action that is \nnecessary to address today\u2019s problems can be achieved \nonly with strong multilateralism and through relevant, \nresponsive and more democratic global institutions.\n\nCritical issues include reforms to the Security \nCouncil and the international financial institutions. \nConcrete progress in Security Council reform is \nimperative in order to assure the continued legitimacy \nand relevance of that important United Nations organ. \nLikewise, accelerated reform of the international \nfinancial institutions is critical if we are to ensure their \neffectiveness in protecting global financial stability \nand supporting sustainable development.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall the proposal \nthat Guyana made through its first democratically \nelected President, Mr. Cheddi Jagan, for a new global \nhuman order, on which the General Assembly has \npronounced itself in several resolutions. That proposal \nseeks to balance the interests of developed and \ndeveloping countries. It is a proposal whose time has \ncome, and it should be pursued with other initiatives \nto find solutions so that we can realize the dreams of \ngenerations that came before us for peace, progress and \nprosperity.\n\nJust as the Millennium Development Goals provided \na new focus and raised hopes in the year 2000, so today \nwe must rekindle that spirit to eradicate poverty and \ninequality in the post-2015 period.\n\nLet me express our appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral and the staff of the United Nations for their \ntireless efforts in carrying out the mandate of the \nOrganization in very challenging times. I assure them \nthat they have the full support of the people and the \nGovernment of Guyana.\n"

        "file_text": "I want to start by congratulating \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly.\n\nWe are living through a period of unprecedented \nprogress in human development. The success of \nthe Millennium Development Goals framework \ndemonstrates that international cooperation remains \nstrong, though we wish the expected results would \ncome faster. Even on climate change, if the public and \nprivate sectors work together to increase investment \nin scientific research, we can look forward to a future \nwhere countries no longer have to choose between \ngreen energy and economic growth.\n\nWhile we work on building peace and well-being \nin Africa, crises elsewhere in the world have aroused \ngrave concern. Efforts to address them seem to have \nlittle effect, and in some cases they may even make \nthings worse.\n\nTwo critically important public goods have been \nconsistently undervalued by the international system in \nits approach to conflict resolution and peacebuilding. \nThey are physical security and national identity. When \nsecurity breaks down, the human costs are enormous. \nExtremists and opportunists are empowered. Citizens \nlose faith in public institutions, as grievances are \nsettled in the street. As a result, sustainable gains in \ngood governance cannot be made. It takes time and \npatience to build a better political system. There are \nno shortcuts. We are dealing with real people who want \nchange, but with continuity and safety. They must be \nfully included in the process of consensus-building. \n\n\nThat is because structures of governance that are not \ndeveloped from within will not take root. We should \nencourage full ownership and partnership, and the \napproach of international institutions and Member \nStates should take those realities into account. In \ncountries that have known only peace, such arguments \nmay sound self-serving. But they are not, because lives \nare at stake.\n\nThe second neglected element is national identity. \nThat is just as important. To manage the diversity in our \nsocieties, politics must be national in scope. Whatever \ndifferences we may have, our common citizenship \nis a bond that unites us. The negative experiences \nof nationalism have created doubt about affirming \npatriotism and national identity. However, what we see \naround the world today is that national identities are too \nweak, not that they are too strong. As a result, ethnicity, \nregion and religion become the dominant currency \nof politics, and nations are torn apart. International \nsystems should encourage efforts by Governments and \ncivil society to strengthen national unity.\n\nIn Rwanda, we have focused on building \naccountable governance institutions and renewing our \ndignity as a nation. As a result, Rwandans today are \namong the most optimistic and civic-minded people \nin the world. For us, stability is not an abstraction, it \nis a reality that abides in the minds and hearts of the \npeople and the institutions they build to sustain it. Once \nachieved, the horizon expands from poverty reduction \nto wealth creation and the attainment of ever higher \nmeasures of human development.\n\nTherefore, our task in the international community \nis not to manage conflicts, but to help prevent and end \nthose conflicts. If we focus on keeping people safe and \nbringing them together to solve their problems, we will \nbe able to do so.\n"

        "file_text": "Humankind faces serious, \nunprecedented crises. Now is the time for us to stand \nunited beneath the flag of the United Nations to confront \nthose crises together. Japan is resolved to continue to \ntake on great responsibility, working hand in hand with \nthe international community.\n\nThe Government of Japan is expending its best \npossible efforts in the fight against the Ebola virus. \nThe international community should come together \nto address that crisis, which directly affects the peace \nand security of Africa. In that regard, Japan, as one \nof its sponsors, has strongly supported the adoption \nof Security Council resolution 2177 (2014). Japan has \nalso supported the initiative of Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon, and His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \nKutesa, President of the General Assembly, to establish \nthe United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency \nResponse.\n\nAt the fifth Tokyo International Conference on \nAfrican Development, held in Japan in the past year, \nthe Government of Japan announced that it would set \naside $500 million to address health issues in Africa \nand launch training programmes for some 120,000 \nhealth and medical-service providers. As a response to \nthe Ebola outbreak, we have sent highly knowledgeable \nand experienced Japanese experts, as members of \nWorld Health Organization missions. We have also \nextended a total of $5 million in financial assistance \nand will provide $500,000 worth of personal protective \nequipment for health-care workers. Furthermore, \nwe pledge to extend additional assistance totaling \n$40 million in future. We continue to be prepared to \ntake any other measures, including the possibility of \nsending more experts to Africa and sharing a potentially \npromising drug developed by Japan\u2019s Toyama Chemical \nCompany and Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, which \ncould be effective in the post-exposure phase of Ebola.\n\nThe Middle East is in a state of unrest. In particular, \nJapan regards the activities of the Islamic State in Iraq \nand the Levant \u2014 which extends across national borders \nand has unilaterally declared the establishment of a so-\ncalled state \u2014 as a serious threat to international order. \nWhat is important now is to prevent extremism from \ntaking root, while responding swiftly to the region\u2019s \nhumanitarian crises. To assist in that, Japan will provide \n$50 million of emergency assistance right away.\n\nPlacing great importance on the stability of \nUkraine, in March Japan swiftly announced economic \nassistance of up to $1.5 billion, which is now being \nimplemented. We are also preparing new assistance \ntowards reconstruction of the eastern part of Ukraine.\n\nNext year will be a momentous one for the United \nNations. We will celebrate its seventieth anniversary. \nAt the time the United Nations was founded, Japan \nwas recovering from having been reduced to ashes. \nSince then, Japan has never for a moment forgotten the \nhorrors of war. It set out on its post-war path abhorring \nthe atrocities of a war that brought tragedy to innocent \npeople both at home and in other nations and renewing \nits pledge towards peace. We have made a wholehearted \ncommitment to shoulder United Nations responsibilities \nat home and abroad.\n\nJapan\u2019s future lies in a straight extension of our \nhistory over the past 70 years. Our pledge to never wage \nwar will be handed down and fostered by the Japanese \npeople for generations to come. Peace will take root only \nwhen conflicts are deprived of places to reside within \nour hearts and our way of life. That is precisely why \nJapan is working to continue taking action at the grass-\nroots level around the world. Japan has been, is now \nand will continue to be a force providing momentum for \nproactive contributions to peace.\n\nMoreover, I wish to state and to pledge, first of all, \nthat Japan is a nation that has worked to eliminate the \nwar culture from people\u2019s hearts, and it will spare no \neffort in continuing to do so. As early as the mid-1980s, \nJapan launched cooperation in Gaza to foster human \nresources. A total of more than 400 administrative \nofficials and technical experts have come to Japan to \nreceive intensive training. One of them is Mr. Najjar \nOsama, a young man serving as an official with the \nPalestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority. \nHe said:\n\n\u201cGaza has no natural resources whatsoever. \nThe only thing we have is people, a situation the \nsame as Japan\u2019s. What I learned in Japan is the \nspirit of never, ever giving up.\u201d\nAfter being educated in Japan for a month, Najjar \nOsama brought solar-power technology back to his \nhometown, to be attached to the facility in greatest need \nof a stand-alone power system. The equipment that he \nand his colleagues introduced to the largest hospital \nin the Gaza Strip has endured the unrest and kept the \nlights on in the hospital\u2019s emergency room.\n\nIt is perhaps more than just a coincidence that the \nSomalia story I wish to tell also relates to lighting. \nThe most important thing for Hamidah Hassan \u2014 a \ngirl 10 years of age, living in the camps for internally \ndisplaced persons in Mogadishu \u2014 was lighting to \nilluminate the camp\u2019s tents at night. A lit tent acts as \na deterrent to sexual violence. Over the past two years, \nJapan has distributed to internally displaced persons, \nincluding young girls such as Hamidah, some 2,500 \nsmall lanterns, made by Panasonic, that bank electricity \ngenerated from sunlight during the day and convert it \nto lamplight at night. Hamidah is now working hard, \ndreaming that one day she will become a doctor.\n\nWe must continue to clear away anxiety and fear \nfrom people\u2019s hearts and cull any shoots of hatred. \nJapan and the Japanese people will continue to do \nour best to offer our own willingness and capacity, \nknowledge and experience, in order to make that a \nreality. First and foremost, we will continue to assist \nin enhancing education, which will form the basis of \neconomic growth for those who need it, from primary \neducation to vocational training. Our aim, always, is \nto internalize the joy of work in people\u2019s nature. We \nhope for people to keenly realize that the sweat brought \nabout by their labour is an investment in the future.\n\nExpanding roads, ports and the increasingly \nconnected power grids, together with effective \ngovernance that is fully in step with those improvements, \nwill help to bring about an affluent and peaceful society \nthat values human rights. When that concept receives \nbroad-based support, people become the owners of \ntheir society in the truest sense of the word. To expand \nthat kind of society from a point to a line, and from a \nline to a plane, Japan has always sought foundations of \npeace. We have always focused our official development \nassistance philosophy on that approach.\n\nThe banner of a proactive contribution to peace \nborne by the Japanese Government is a flag planted \natop the natural development of conviction and self-\nconfidence that we have acquired through many years \nof promoting human security, that is, working as hard \nas we could for the development of a society that places \npeople front and centre. We will carry on with our work, \nhoping to create, in time, a fair and just society that \nplaces human beings front and centre and a democracy \nthat values human rights.\n\nSeventy years ago, the United Nations proclaimed \nits determination \u201cto save succeeding generations from \nthe scourge of war\u201d and to \u201cpractice tolerance\u201d. The \nUnited Nations must not depart from those ideals. It \nis with exactly that determination that Japan aspires to \njoin the Security Council once again as a non-permanent \nmember next year, marking the seventieth year since \nthe start of the United Nations.\n\nOver the 58 long years since Japan became a \nMember of the United Nations in 1956, as its eightieth \nMember, Japan has worked tirelessly for the causes of \nthe United Nations. We believe that our efforts have \nbeen second to none. It is my wish, with the seventieth \nanniversary as a turning point, that countries sharing \nthe same aims can all work together to finally resolve \nthe long-standing issue of the reform of the United \nNations in a way that reflects the realities of the twenty-\nfirst century. In that context, Japan seeks to become a \npermanent member of the Security Council and to take \non an appropriate role that the status requires.\n\nIt was on the same occasion last year that I spoke \nof the significance and importance of enhancing the \npower of women and appealed for us to create a society \nin which women shine (see A/68/PV.12). Japan has now \nbegun to work towards resolving the numerous issues \nwe face, together with private industries, in order to \nincrease women\u2019s participation in society as soon as \npossible. We must foster environments in which it is \npossible to balance child care and nursing care on the \none hand and work on the other. In addition, eliminating \nbiases about the roles of women that still exist in society \nwill be basic, more so than anything else.\n\nWe have just held a large-scale international \nconference with an aim of promoting the dynamic \nparticipation of women. With an eye set on economic \ndevelopment and the resolution of global issues, \nabout 100 leaders from all sectors of society from \naround the world sent out a message to the world of \ntheir commitment to bringing the power of women to \nfruition. In less than a year, the empowerment of women \nhas become a guiding principle that has driven Japan\u2019s \npolicies both domestically and overseas. Japan has \nfocused on advancing the status of girls and mothers \nin Africa, a region that receives emphasis within our \nforeign aid.\n\nThe twentieth century had a history of profound \nharm to women\u2019s honour and dignity when conflicts \nbroke out. Around the globe, we still find abhorrent \ncircumstances in which women are denied access \nto such basic services as medical care and education \nmerely because they were born female, thereby \ndepriving them of opportunities to become self-reliant. \nJapan seeks to be a country that walks alongside such \nwomen throughout the world. We intend to encourage \nand support, throughout the world, the self-reliance of \nwomen whose hearts have suffered grievous harm.\n\nWe intend to make the twenty-first century a \nworld without human rights violations against women. \nJapan will stand at the fore and lead the international \ncommunity in eliminating sexual violence during \nconflicts. Therein lies the reason for Japan to reinforce \nits cooperation with Ms. Zainab Bangura\u2019s Office of \nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General on \nSexual Violence in Conflict.\n\nFundamental rights such as education and health \nmust be ensured everywhere throughout the world. It is \nnecessary for the United Nations and, indeed, the world \nto come together as one to take action so that girls \nand boys can attend school equally and that expectant \nmothers can receive medical care with peace of mind. \nMoreover, in order for women to lead lives full of pride \nand hope, I consider it essential to develop their ability \nto be economically self-reliant, above all else. I do not \nhave the slightest doubt that the creation of a society \nin which women shine holds the key to changing the \nwhole of society.\n\nLast year I pledged in my address here, before \nthe General Assembly, that Japan would implement \nassistance in excess of $3 billion over three years, \naimed chiefly at advancing the status of women. The \namount already implemented over the past year is \n$1.8 billion, more than half the amount pledged. I also \nstated Japan respected the activities of UN-Women, \nwhich is responsible for women\u2019s issues within the \nUnited Nations, and that we intended to become one \nof its leading contributors and thus a model country \nin that area. Over the past year, Japan increased its \ncontributions to UN-Women fivefold, and in the future \nwe will further increase the number of projects we \nsupport. We are also very pleased that next year UN-\nWomen will open its Tokyo office. I expect that Japan \nwill further enhance its coordination with the United \nNations through that new office.\n\nAs we draw up the post-2015 development agenda, \nJapan will continue to be as strongly involved as it \nhas been to date. However, I strongly urge that if we \nare to truly attain inclusiveness, sustainability and \nresilience, as put forth in that agenda, then protection \nand empowerment of the vulnerable, irrespective of \nrace, gender, or age, is important.\n\nThis year Japan marks the sixtieth anniversary \nof the start of its official development assistance \n(ODA). Having learned from the determination of \nour predecessors, who began working to extend ODA \n\n\na mere nine years after suffering total devastation in \nwar, the Government of Japan is now in the process of \nestablishing new guiding principles for our ODA. We \nintend to once more emphasize as priorities objectives \nsuch as high-quality economic growth, ensuring rule of \nlaw and realizing a peaceful and stable society.\n\nThe objectives that Japan has continuously targeted \nthrough its ODA over those 60 years will not change \nin the slightest. There will be no change in our deeply \nrooted approach in which the most important thing in the \nfight against poverty is to cultivate a sense of ownership \namong the people concerned and to encourage self-help \nefforts. Nor will there be any changes in our efforts to \nfully ensure human security. Moreover, as we pursue \nenhancing women\u2019s empowerment as the leverage \npoint, I consider the attainment of our goals to be that \nmuch nearer.\n\nOver the past 20 years Japan has sent about \n9,700 people on 13 United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. In the 10 years since the establishment of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission, Japan\u2019s contributions \nto the Peacebuilding Fund have surpassed $40 million. \nIn the future, we intend to cultivate still further our \nhuman resources in terms of both quantity and quality, \nto contribute to the area of peacebuilding.\n\nAs the only country ever to have suffered the \ndevastation of atomic bombings during wartime, Japan \nis prepared to lead discussions in the Review Conference \nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons to be convened next year \u2014 the \nseventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings.\n\nWith regard to North Korea, Japan will work \nin coordination with relevant countries towards the \ncomprehensive resolution of outstanding issues, \nincluding abduction and nuclear and missile issues.\n\nJapan has been among the biggest beneficiaries of \nthe United Nations. Going forward, we will work harder \nthan ever to bring about realization of the principles \nset forth by the United Nations. Japan is a nation that \nimplements its pledges without fail. With that, I will \nend my discussion.\n"

        "file_text": " We are \nmeeting at a symbolically significant time, between \nthe 100th anniversary of the First World War and the \nseventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World \nWar. Seven decades ago, at the end of the Second World \nWar, the United Nations was established. Its mission \nwas to form a new environment for civilization and \nculture in order to prevent the repetition of the previous \ntragic events of history.\n\nThe year 2015 is of particular significance \nfor all Armenians around the world. On 24 April, \nArmenians around the globe will commemorate \nthe 100th anniversary of the most tragic page in the \nnation\u2019s history: the Armenian genocide. It was an \nunprecedented crime, the objective of which was to \neliminate the nation and deprive it of its homeland, \nand it remains an unhealed wound for every Armenian. \nThe 1915 genocide was a crime against civilization and \nhumanity, and its inadequate condemnation paved the \nway for similar crimes of mass murder in the future.\n\nAddressing the Assembly ahead of that 100th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide from this \nrostrum, which I would call the podium of honour \nand responsibility, I declare our profound thanks \nto Uruguay, France, Russia, Italy, Belgium, the \nNetherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, Poland, \nLithuania, Greece, Slovakia, Cyprus, Lebanon, \nArgentina, Venezuela, Chile, Canada and the Holy See. \nWe thank them for their recognition and condemnation \nof the Armenian genocide, regardless of the form it \ntook or the language used to express it. I thank the \nUnited States of America, the European Union and all \nthose personalities, State bodies, territorial units and \norganizations in many countries that publicly called \nthings by their proper name. That is indeed extremely \nimportant, since denial is an integral part of the crime \nof genocide.\n\nFor an entire century now, Armenians around \nthe globe and the entire progressive international \ncommunity have been waiting for Turkey to show \ncourage and face its own history by recognizing the \nArmenian genocide, thus relieving future generations \nof the heavy burden of the past. Alas, instead, we \n\n\ncontinue to hear ambiguous and messages with ulterior \nmotives, in which the victim and the slaughterer are set \non equal footing and history is falsified.\n\nArmenia has never made recognition of the \nArmenian genocide a condition for the normalization \nof bilateral relations with Turkey. In fact, Armenia was \nthe party that initiated that process of normalization, \nwhich in 2009 culminated in the signing of the Zurich \nprotocols. However, those protocols have been shelved \nfor years now, awaiting ratification in the Turkish \nParliament. Ankara has declared publicly that it will \nratify the protocols only if Armenians cede Nagorny \nKarabakh and Artsakh to Azerbaijan. In Armenia \nand Artsakh, ordinary people often simply retort: \u201cTo \nhell with your ratification.\u201d This vernacular phrase \nsummarizes the age-old struggle of the entire nation \nand unequivocally explains to those who attempt to \nbargain with others\u2019 homeland that the motherland is \nsacrosanct and they had better stay away from us with \ntheir bargain. It is in these circumstances that, currently, \nYerevan is seriously considering the issue of recalling \nthe Armenian-Turkish protocols from Parliament.\n\nThe tragic events in Syria and Iraq that we are \ncurrently witnessing demonstrate how groups whose \ncreed is hatred are targeting religious and national \nminorities. Two days ago, on Armenia\u2019s independence \nday, the Saint Martyrs Armenian Church in Dayr \nAl-Zour, Syria, dedicated to the memory of the victims \nof the Armenian genocide, was mined and blown \nup by the terrorists. Such barbarity is a criminal \ndemonstration of godlessness, which is in no way or \nshape related to any faith. The catastrophic situation in \nSyria and northern Iraq continues to deteriorate, and \ntoday hundreds of thousands of people are directly in \nperil. Among them are tens of thousands of Armenians \nin Aleppo, Syria. It is one instance to consider in the \ncontext of our joint commitment to preventing crimes \nagainst humanity. Armenia has voiced on numerous \noccasions the need to defend the Armenian population \nof Syria and the Yazidi population of north-western \nIraq, and we are encouraged by the unified stance of \nthe international community in that regard.\n\nThe maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is the essence of our Organization. In recent \nyears, Armenia has consistently consolidated its \npeacekeeping capabilities thereby preparing ourselves \nfor more proactive engagement in that field. Armenian \npeacekeepers will very soon be dispatched to the south \nof Lebanon in the context of the United Nations Interim \nForce in Lebanon. The close collaboration we enjoy \nwith our Italian colleagues enabled our participation in \nthat endeavour. I strongly believe that our servicemen \nwill fulfil their mission with dignity and a high level of \nprofessionalism and will use the extensive experience \nthey have garnered in the last decade in Kosovo, Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n\nIt has been more than 20 years that our neighbouring \nState, through its unconstructive and maximalist \nstance, has thwarted the international community\u2019s \nefforts aimed at the just and peaceful settlement of the \nNagorno Karabakh conflict. The bellicose declarations \nand various threats made at the highest level in \nAzerbaijan have been completely tolerated on account \nof the international community\u2019s failure to correctly \nassess them. The President of Azerbaijan has designated \nthe entire Armenian nation as enemy number one, and \nwhat is considered in the rest of the world to be a crime, \nin Azerbaijan is considered to be a heroic act.\n\nDespite the fact that each conflict is unique, \nfundamental human rights and freedoms, including \npeoples\u2019 right to freely express their will and self-\ndetermination, continue to evolve as a determinant \nin their resolution. The vote held a few days ago in \nScotland once again proved that nowadays referendums \nare more and more widely perceived as a legal model \nfor the peaceful settlement of ethnic conflicts. It was \nno coincidence that the right to decide one\u2019s own fate \nthrough a referendum is at the core of the proposal put \nforward by the co-Chairs of the Minsk Group of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) for the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh \nconflict.\n\nWhile discussing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \nsettlement, I must address the four Security Council \nresolutions \u2014 resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 \n(1993) and 884 (1993) \u2014 adopted during the war, \nwhich every so often are exploited by the Azerbaijani \nauthorities in order to justify their obstructionist policy. \nThose four resolutions demand, as a matter of priority, \nthe unconditional cessation of all military hostilities. \nAzerbaijan has failed to comply. Azerbaijan\u2019s own \nnon-compliance with the fundamental demands of the \nresolutions make their full implementation impossible. \nThe resolutions call on the parties to cease their \nbombardments and air strikes targeting the peaceful \ncivilian population and to refrain from violating \nthe principles of international humanitarian law. \nHowever, Azerbaijan has continued its indiscriminate \n\n\nbombardments of the civilian population. Azerbaijan \nhas not spared children, women or the elderly, \nthereby gravely violating all legal and moral norms \nof international humanitarian law. Now Azerbaijan \ncynically refers to those resolutions selectively \u2014 citing \nthem out of context as a prerequisite for the settlement \nof the conflict. An adequate interpretation of the \nSecurity Council resolutions is not possible without a \ncorrect understanding of the hierarchy of the demands \nset therein.\n\nThe resolutions, inter alia, request the restoration \nof economic, transport and energy links in the region \nand the removal of all obstacles to communications \nand transportation. It is no secret that Azerbaijan and \nTurkey imposed a blockade on Nagorno Karabakh and \nthe Republic of Armenia at the outset of the conflict. \nIn his statements, the Azerbaijani President even takes \npride in that fact, promising his public that such action \nwould remain the priority of Azerbaijan\u2019s foreign \npolicy.\n\nThe aforementioned Security Council resolutions \ncall on Azerbaijan to establish direct contacts with \nNagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan has refused to establish \nany direct contacts with Nagorno Karabakh, which \nwas a legally equal party to the ceasefire agreement \nconcluded in 1994, as well as a number of other \ninternational agreements. Moreover, Azerbaijan \npreaches hatred towards the people it claims it wants to \nsee as a part of its State.\n\nNone of the Security Council resolutions identifies \nArmenia as a conflicting party. Our country is called \nupon only to continue to exert its influence over the \nNagorno Karabakh Armenians in order to put an end \nto the conflict. Armenia has fully complied, and due \nto its efforts a ceasefire agreement was concluded in \n1994. All Security Council resolutions refer to Nagorno \nKarabakh as a party to the conflict.\n\nThe Azerbaijani authorities have failed to \nimplement the fundamental demands of the Security \nCouncil resolutions, including abiding by and adhering \nto the humanitarian norms. Incidentally, Azerbaijan has \noccasionally gravely violated that demand. Azerbaijan\u2019s \ncruel and inhumane treatment of Armenian civilian \nprisoners of war regularly results in their deaths, \nalthough I imagine that no one would be surprised about \nthat, since Azerbaijan is the very State that suppresses \nand exercises the most inhumane treatment of its own \npeople. A clear proof of that was the decision of the \nSubcommittee on Prevention of Torture to suspend its \nvisit to Azerbaijan due to the obstructions it encountered \nin the conduct of the official Baku.\n\nThe OSCE Minsk Group is the only specialized \nstructure that has been dealing with the Nagorno \nKarabakh issue according to the mandate granted \nby the international community. While Azerbaijan \nknows that it could not possibly deceive or misinform \nthe Minsk Group, which is well aware of the essence \nof the problem, it attempts to transpose the conflict \nsettlement to other platforms by trying to depict it as \na territorial dispute or exploiting the factor of religious \nsolidarity. That is ironic, since Armenia traditionally \nenjoys very warm relations with the Islamic nations, \nboth in the Arabic-speaking world or, for instance, with \nour immediate neighbour Iran.\n\nWe highly value the indispensable role of the \nUnited Nations in the adjustment and implementation \nof the development goals. I strongly believe that, \nthrough the new post-2015 development agenda, we will \ncontinue our efforts to seek solutions and respond to \nglobal challenges, in accordance with the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline that we \nhave covered a substantial part of the path towards the \nshaping of the post-2015 development agenda and we \nwill continue our endeavours in that regard, displaying \nthe flexibility necessary to bring the process to its \nlogical conclusion.\n"

        "file_text": "Samoa congratulates the \nPresident on his election and lends its full support to \nthe agenda that will guide our work during his tenure. \nIn the same spirit, I applaud our Secretary-General \nand Samoan Prince Tupua Ban Ki-moon for his firm \ncommitment and strong leadership in steering our \nOrganization during this particularly turbulent and \ndifficult period for the world.\n\nAs members of the global family, our futures and \ninterests are inextricably linked. Crises with a global \nreach threaten to engulf the world and affect all nations \nirrespective of whether they caused or contributed to \nthe crisis.\n\nClimate change is one such crisis. It is the world\u2019s \nmost urgent problem and the greatest moral challenge \nof our time. Known crises of global dimensions pale in \ncomparison to what climate change poses to our world \nas a whole and to the future security of some of our \nlow-lying islands as sovereign States. Climate change is \nindifferent to the suffering of countries touched by its \ndestructive reach. The victims can be rich or poor, large \nor small, resilient or vulnerable, but they hardly matter. \nIt impacts all. For some there are already existential \nimplications looming. Others may consider the effect \non them to be minimal. Such complacency would be a \ngrave mistake and tantamount to gross negligence. If \nclimate change is not addressed comprehensively, the \nconsequences for our planet will be dire indeed and \nwill affect all countries.\n\nNo country should therefore stay detached and \nunconcerned before the plight of the majority. All \ncountries must work together. Apportioning blame \nfor the present state of our environment is in itself yet \nanother human failing. It serves no useful purpose. \nBeing judgemental will not restore our environment. \nThose who exploit the traditional divide between \ndeveloped and developing countries and ideological \nand political differences do so conveniently, to mask \ntheir own unwillingness to be part of the solution to an \nimpending global catastrophe.\n\nThere is too much at stake for the world to just sit \nidly by. Strong visionary leadership that rises beyond \nthe dictates of vested national interests and political \ntenures and views the world as a single constituency \nwhere everyone must work together within the limits \nof their capacity and capability to be part of the total \nsolution is at a premium. Governments must yield \u2014 not \nto vested interests and expediency of time, but because \nit is the ethical and just thing to do. Our timelines are \nslipping by fast and soon we will be playing catch-up. \nYet each day lost to indecisiveness and wrangling on \npetty points only intensifies the challenges we face. \nThe Lima and Paris climate conferences will provide \nthe best openings for the world to redeem itself. States \n\nMembers of the United Nations should step forward \nwith a sense of urgency and commitment to addressing \nclimate change today, not tomorrow. It should not just \nbe science and real life experiences that force us to act, \nbut also our consciences.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Climate Summit on \nTuesday was timely. Its message was clear and simple. \nOur actions to address climate change are grossly \ninadequate. We are focusing more on symptoms than \non the root causes, and the solemn truth is that things \nwill only get worse if we do not act collectively now. \nHowever, a ray of hope, best captured in the following \nfundamental truths, is couched delicately in this \nominous prediction.\n\nFirst, climate change is a societal problem \nrequiring decisive political leadership and a whole-of-\nsociety approach. Every individual effort and every \nnational action counts because in unity we succeed, \nbut in division there is little we can do. Secondly, we \nneed a global solution if we are to succeed. The United \nNations is our last best hope. It is indispensable to a \nsustainable solution that we provide the necessary \ncommitment to turning the tide against climate change. \nThirdly, climate change is solvable, and the solution is \nfirmly in our hands.\n\nOnly through enlightened leadership and the \nconcerted efforts of all countries, with the major \ngreenhouse gas emitters at the forefront, do we stand \na chance of lessening the destructive impact of climate \nchange and of reaching a credible post-Kyoto climate \nagreement next year. Samoa calls upon those States \nMembers of our Organization that are in a position of \nworld leadership to lead the charge and to undertake \nthe tasks that need to be implemented quickly and \ndecisively so that the Paris conference can deliver \non an ambitious climate change agreement that is \neffective, binding, capable of swift implementation, \nand universally owned and respected by the 193 States \nMembers of the United Nations.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak is a deadly pandemic causing \nchaos and untold suffering in parts of West Africa. \nIts reach is global and if it is not treated it may prove \nunstoppable. It has no respect for national borders or \nGovernment sovereignty, and its victims are selected \nindiscriminately. Born and unborn babies are robbed \nof their youth, girls and boys of their adulthood, and \nwomen and men of their productive lives, their dignity \nand worth, while countries are dispossessed and \ndeprived of their valuable human assets.\n\nCan we win the war on Ebola? Samoa believes that \nwe can and we should. That was why we were honoured \nto be among the 134 co-sponsors of Security Council \nresolution 2177 (2014) on peace and security in Africa, \nwith reference to Ebola, last Thursday. The Security \nCouncil resolution was adopted with the highest-ever \nnumber of sponsors and was swiftly followed the \nnext day by General Assembly resolution 69/1, which \nunanimously approved a proposal to establish the United \nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Samoa \nwelcomes the rapid, decisive and coordinated response \nof United Nations Member States and agencies, and \nin particular the proactive role the Secretary-General \nplayed in mobilizing both the political will and the \nmaterial resources necessary to respond to this grave \ncrisis.\n\nThe global response to the Ebola outbreak is a \npowerful illustration of what is possible when States \ncollaborate and coordinate to assist each other in \nachieving common and critical goals. Such unified \nresponses have tangible results and save lives. Samoa \nencourages all Member States to take this spirit of \ncooperation forward, and to harness and follow this \nexample when dealing with other critical global issues.\n\nAs we meet here at the United Nations, the \nrise in extremism has a taken a turn for the worst. \nRadical militants are committing unspeakably brutal \nand barbaric atrocities across the Middle East, and \nthreatening to spread their evil brand further afield. As \na small island nation in the Pacific Ocean, these threats \ncan seem extremely far removed from my country \nof Samoa. However, in the globalized age in which \nwe live, all countries are threatened by challenges to \ninternational peace and security. Developments in one \nState invariably have effects in others, and this is true \nof my country, far away as we are.\n\nGlobal interconnectedness has brought innumerable \nbenefits to all countries, but it also increasingly brings \nrisks from distant corners of the Earth. As such, it is \nimperative that the United Nations and its Member \nStates commit to tackling threats to international peace \nand security, especially through the Security Council. \nSpecifically, States Members of the United Nations \nmust increase their collaboration and cooperation to \nfind solutions to challenges to peace and security, and \nwork diligently to implement them.\n\nThe United Nations was founded upon the values \nof collective security and, for small nations, remains a \ncritical forum in which to contribute to the maintenance \n\nof international peace and security, stability and \nprosperity. This is particularly important for small \nisland developing States (SIDS), which risk a reversal \nof the development gains they have made due to crises \nfar from home. To cement and build upon development \ngoals already achieved, international peace and \nsecurity must be maintained, and it is the responsibility \nof all Member States, particularly those on the Security \nCouncil, to work in close cooperation to ensure that this \nhappens.\n\nSamoa belongs to the group of small island \ndeveloping States, a United Nations-recognized group \nwith special needs and inherent vulnerabilities, not by \nchoice, but by dint of factors completely outside its \ncontrol. Part of the dilemma we continually face is the \nmisconception that SIDS challenges are minuscule in \ncomparison to the needs of other special groups and \nregions, and that their one and only concern is climate \nchange. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nMy country was honoured to host, on behalf of \nthe Pacific region, the once-in-a decade International \nConference on Small Island Developing States three \nweeks ago. Our primary goal in hosting the Third SIDS \nConference was to have the spotlight of international \nattention fall on SIDS, their challenges and realities. \nNow that the spotlight has faded, we hope that the \nincreased understanding and appreciation of SIDS \nissues and challenges gained at the Conference will not \nbe forgotten over time or sidelined by other competing \npriority issues.\n\nThe international community has a very full agenda. \nWe as nations are being pulled in many directions. \nThis general debate and the sixty-ninth session of \nthe General Assembly will show just how packed \nthe agenda is. The follow-up to the SIDS Conference \nwill be part of that agenda. It is our hope that, despite \nall the political, economic and other demands on the \ncountries of the world, the realities of SIDS, so clearly \nspelled out in Apia and in the Small Island Developing \nStates Accelerated Modalities of Action \u2014 the SAMOA \nPathway \u2014 are able to retain the attention of the \nwider international community. We took seriously the \ncommitments made to SIDS at the Conference and we \nwill remain deeply mindful of how those commitments \nare turned into actions.\n\nThe Conference had as its theme \u201cThe sustainable \ndevelopment of SIDS through genuine and durable \npartnerships\u201d. We are ready to build on our existing \npartnerships. We may be small, but we are also able to \ndemonstrate the impact of our people and our countries \nin successful, twenty-first century partnerships. \nWe may be small and sometimes invisible to many. \nHowever, we know that united the SIDS are a strong \nand positive group. The Alliance of Small Island States \n(AOSIS) is showing its determination in a growing \nrange of areas and forums. Samoa, like other Pacific \nislands, is proud of its place within AOSIS.\n\nThe SAMOA Pathway asks the Secretary-General \nto undertake a comprehensive review of how the United \nNations system supports SIDS. This is an opportunity \nto ensure that the United Nations is fit for the purpose \nwhen it comes to supporting SIDS. There is ample scope \nfor improvement, and we look forward to engaging \nfully in the process. The time for business as usual has \nlong passed. Let us work for an approach to SIDS that \nshows the United Nations at its best.\n\nThe SAMOA Pathway is a well-crafted \nintergovernmental agreement that has the seal and \nstamp of approval of the United Nations membership. \nGoing forward, it falls on SIDS themselves to be \nprepared to lead and own the SAMOA Pathway if it is \nto be sustainable. Together with the specific entities \nwithin the Secretariat charged with advocating and \nchampioning SIDS causes, they should be more \nproactive and assertive. Jointly, they must reposition \nthemselves to engage better in a more effective and \nvisible partnership.\n\nMoreover, what we need to achieve is a human face \nof SIDS to every issue that comes before the United \nNations, be it security, human rights, climate change, \ndevelopment, gender or indigenous issues. That way, \nSIDS issues will be at the forefront of the United \nNations agenda. They will remain topical and relevant \nand be taken up, debated and acted upon daily, weekly \nor monthly \u2014 and not conveniently set aside to be \ndiscussed only when we have another SIDS conference \n10 years from now.\n\nSamoa continues to support United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts worldwide. Small though we \nare, Samoan police continue to serve side by side with \nofficers from other countries in places that require the \nintervention of the United Nations. Within the Pacific \nregion, our solidarity with our neighbours in meeting \nchallenges means a guaranteed Samoan police presence \nin the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \nand under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum.\n\n\nA durable peace settlement in the Middle East \ncontinues to elude us, but that is not grounds to be \npessimistic. We should support every effort to create \nconditions conducive to the successful establishment of \nan independent Palestinian State alongside a secure and \nsafe State of Israel.\n\nFinally, those bent on creating fear and panic \nthroughout the world will stop at nothing to achieve \ntheir aims. We must not be held hostage to their devious \ndesigns. Individually and collectively, we must step \nup our efforts to combat the threat of international \nterrorism in its many manifestations. No country can \nsucceed on its own. Only by working collaboratively \ncan we be successful.\n\nAs we approach the new post-2015 development \nagenda, the culmination of many years of international \nnegotiations and agreements on sustainable development, \nwe must ensure that while a one-framework approach \nis important, it does not equate to a one-size-fits-all \nformula for purposes of implementation, monitoring and \nevaluation. Indeed, the applicability of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and their indicators to small island \ncountries proved difficult, and much tailoring was \nnecessary before those global targets were seen as \nrelevant enough for us to meaningfully participate. \nIt is important therefore in the defining and refining \nof the sustainable development goals and post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda that we account for groups like \nSIDS and ensure that the indicators developed are also \napplicable to their situations. Building on the existing \nprocesses and experiences in the SIDS countries and \ntheir respective regions and subregions is critical in \nthat regard.\n\nFortunately, we are on the back of a successful \nSIDS Conference whose theme focused on effective \nmeans of implementation through partnerships. We \nmust ensure therefore that the means to implement \nthe SAMOA Pathway is solidly incorporated into \nthe post-2015 development framework. Those \narrangements are well entrenched in the High-level \nPolitical Forum and the review arrangements of the \nEconomic and Social Council. It is important that \nthe intergovernmental architectures of our respective \nSIDS regions be included in the process, which means \nworking together. We cannot afford a situation where \nwe have intergovernmental organizations developing \nseparate policies and implementation arrangements \nand partnerships for the same things. We must work \ntogether.\n\nFinally, we must break down what has been a \ntraditional them-and-us perception on both sides of \nthe divide between Member States and the Secretariat \nestablished to serve our collective needs. It has not \nserved either side well; we are in fact on the same \nside. I would therefore encourage any coordination \nmechanisms established to ensure representation of \nboth in order to promote transparency and a balance \nof perspectives and interests. The Inter-Agency \nConsultative Group for SIDS is perhaps an arrangement \nthat could benefit from Member State representation \nas well, where open discussions can take place around \neffective implementation of the SAMOA Pathway and \nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nSome of our development partners, traditional \nand new, have reached out to help us. What they have \nin common is trust and respect for our views and \nneeds. Bilaterally, regionally and internationally, they \nare partnering with SIDS to overcome some of the \nconstraints imposed by limited land and narrow natural \nresource bases, isolation and downward agricultural \nproduction, sustained food security for our expanding \npopulations, and the need to provide a meaningful \nexistence for our people and communities in the rural \nareas.\n\nThe United Nations was established to prevent \nwars, bring peace and security, and protect human \nrights through multilateralism and intergovernmental \ncooperation. The architecture of the Organization \nwe have today is very complex, and, inevitably, \nthere are imperfections. However, the fact that we \nhave consistently met without failure at the General \nAssembly each year is irrefutable proof that our \nOrganization works at many and different levels. It \nis hard to imagine where the world would be without \nthe United Nations. It is why Samoa\u2019s support for our \nOrganization is unwavering.\n"

        "file_text": "Change has become an \noverriding theme in the language of today`s social and \npolitical landscape. We speak of the need to change \nbehaviours, attitudes and laws. We speak of the need \nto effect change in the areas of human rights and social \njustice, in education and health administration. We \nhave come to understand the concept of change as a \nconstant in our lives as human beings and as citizens \nof this world. But the question we are asking is, does \nchange automatically signify progress?\n\nThere is an old saying with which I am sure everyone \nhere is familiar: the more things change, the more they \nstay the same. Sometimes, when I find myself listening \nto reports of the many recent developments taking place \nin the world, that saying comes to mind again, and I am \novercome with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as though we \nhad been here before.\n\nWhen I hear reports about the taking of hostages \nand the savagery of beheadings, it is 2004 all over \nagain, and week after week there is news of the killing \nof foreign hostages in Iraq. When I hear reports about \nIsrael and Gaza, it is 2005 all over again, and Israel \nhas launched Operation Summer Rain, immediately \nfollowed by Operation Autumn Clouds. The resulting \ndeath toll in the Gaza Strip was in the hundreds, and \nmany of the dead were children. Similarly, in the United \nStates, reports of police brutality against an unarmed \nblack man take me back to 1999, when 23-year-old \nGuinea-born Amadou Diallo was shot 19 times by four \nNew York City police officers, or to 1991, when Rodney \nKing was brutally beaten by five Los Angeles police \nofficers. Both of those incidents caused a tremendous \npublic outcry, as did this year\u2019s shooting death of \n18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, \nwith the singular message of \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d.\n\n\nDo such events indicate an outright regression? \nDoes the uncomfortable familiarity of some current \nworld events mean that, despite the changes so many \nindividuals and organizations have worked to achieve, \nwe have made little or no progress? I would like to \nbelieve that this is not so. I would like to believe those \nevents of recent times are merely setbacks that will \nmotivate us to find more sustainable solutions; they \nare just slight reversals on the sinuous path toward true \nprogress.\n\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who served as the second \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, from 1953 \nuntil his untimely death in a plane crash in 1961, said,\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of peace and progress cannot \nend in a few years in either victory or defeat. The \npursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and its \nerrors, its successes and its setbacks, can never be \nrelaxed and never abandoned.\u201d\nIn the course of the past several months, since \nthe beginning of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, \nI have been reminded of both the importance and \nthe practicality of those words. True progress relies \non neither victory nor defeat; true progress relies on \npersistence, on perseverance. Just last week, on Monday, \nin my capacity as the Chair of Economic Community of \nWest African States (ECOWAS), I travelled to Liberia, \nSierra Leone and Guinea \u2014 the three countries that \nhave been most affected by the outbreak of Ebola. They \nare nations that are recovering from conflict. The civil \nwars in Liberia and Sierra Leone also adversely affected \nGuinea, which shares borders with both countries. \nThey are nations that were struggling to rebuild their \nsocial and economic infrastructure. Even before the \noutbreak of Ebola, they were already operating with \nlimited resources, an insufficient number of treatment \nfacilities and a shortage of qualified medical personnel.\n\nSo far, there have been 5,843 recorded cases of Ebola, \nincluding 2,803 deaths. The World Health Organization \npredicts that if the disease is not brought under control, \nthe number of cases could easily rise to 20,000 by as \nearly as November. What makes Ebola so dangerous is \nthat the virus dares us to compromise the impulses that \nexist at the very core of our humanity \u2014 our impulse \nto comfort one another with love, to care for each other \nwith the healing power of touch and to maintain the \ndignity of our loved ones even in death, with a public \nfuneral and a properly marked grave.\n\nEbola is a disease of isolation. It leaves family \nmembers afraid to embrace one another. It leaves \nhealth-care workers afraid to attend to their patients. \nIt forces the living to abandon the cultural rites of \nwashing, embalming and burying their dead. Instead, \nthe dead are zipped into a secure body bag, carried on \na stretcher by makeshift pallbearers in protective wear, \nand then tossed into a freshly dug grave.\n\nJust as individuals with Ebola are often shunned and \nostracized by their communities, the initial slowness of \nresponse by the international community in many ways \nhas left the affected countries to suffer their fate alone \nand in isolation. In my travels to those three countries, \nalthough I was aware that some airlines had suspended \nflights, I was shocked to find the airports completely \nvacant. Ebola is not just a Liberian problem, nor is it a \nSierra Leonean or Guinean problem; it is not just a West \nAfrican problem. Ebola is a problem that belongs to the \nworld because it is a disease that knows no boundaries.\n\nWe cannot afford to let fear keep us away or to let \nit compromise the very impulses that not only define \nbut sustain our humanity. We must erase the stigma. To \nthat end, my country, Ghana, has offered the use of its \ncapital city, Accra, as a base of operations for activities \ngeared towards the containment of the disease. I would \nlike to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nthe Security Council for establishing the United Nations \nMission for Ebola Emergency Response. I would also \nlike to acknowledge and commend President Barack \nObama and the people of the United States of America \nfor their enormous commitment to the fight against \nEbola.\n\nHealth officials have announced numerous times \nthat in theory, it is relatively easy to stop the spread \nof Ebola because it is transmitted through contact \nwith bodily fluids. It has been suggested that through \nchanges in our behaviour and practices the public could \npotentially reduce, if not eliminate, their exposure \nto the virus. Yet in reality, the Ebola virus was able \nto spread so quickly throughout the West African \nsubregion because of the fluidity of our borders.\n\nThe free movement of people, goods and services \nthroughout the West African subregion is something \nthat ECOWAS has been promoting for the last several \ndecades. It allows interaction and increased trade \nbetween our 15 member States. However, without the \nproper preventive measures in place, such fluidity can \nalso enable the free movement of disease, drugs, arms, \nhuman traffickers and terrorists.\n\n\nUnfortunately. Africa is especially vulnerable to \nterrorism because its sheer size and vast terrain offers \nmyriad places for terrorists to hide and create safe \nhavens. With over 60 per cent of Africa\u2019s population \nunder the age of 35 and a significant number living in \nextreme poverty, terrorists also have the opportunity to \nrecruit new members by exploiting the ignorance and \ndisillusionment of young people who lack the skills, \neducation and opportunity to find gainful employment.\n\nThe proliferation of technology has made even \nthe most remote areas of the continent accessible \nthrough a phone call or keystroke. What that does is \nfacilitate communication within terrorist cells and \nbetween terrorist organizations. It would now be far \ntoo simplistic, not to mention myopic, for a nation \nto believe that it is dealing with any one terrorist \norganization, such as Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab. Ansar \nAl-Dine, Al-Qaida, Hizbullah, the Taliban, the Islamic \nState in Iraq and the Levant or, recently, the Khorasan \ngroup. Because of the assistance and cooperation that \nexist among them, they have in fact become different \ntentacles of a single organism. So too must we come \ntogether as one cohesive body, united in our battle \nto defend our freedoms and values. We too must \ncommunicate within and among ourselves. We must \ncooperate and lend assistance and resources to fight \nand conquer the common threat we face.\n\nSince the start of the global recession, economic \ngrowth rates have generally declined and people have, \nby and large, become pessimistic about their future. \nThis month, the Pew Research Center published the \nresults of a 44-country survey conducted in the spring of \n2014 to assess public views of major economic changes \nin the world. According to the results, a global median \nof 69 per cent are not pleased with the way things are \ngoing in their countries. That includes both advanced \nand developing economies. The concerns expressed \ncut across a wide spectrum of issues, such as inflation, \nunemployment, income inequality and public debt.\n\nMy country, Ghana, is no exception. Over the \npast year, the public has seen an increase in the cost \nof living. Falling commodity prices led not only to a \nfall in tax revenues from companies that operate in \nGhana, but they also led to a massive decline in our \nexport earnings. That contributed to a general sense of \nmacroeconomic instability and placed a great deal of \npressure on our domestic currency, the cedi.\n\nFor the past 22 years, Ghanaians have witnessed \na steady improvement in the circumstances of our \nnation. With the return of democracy and the rule of \nlaw, six successful elections and peaceful transitions \nof power, Ghana became an example for other African \nnations turning towards democracy and constitutional \nrule. The stability inspired investor confidence and \nincreased growth. Soon Ghana was deemed one of the \nfastest-growing economies in the world.\n\nThat did not make us immune to the economic \nchallenges that many nations were facing across the \nglobe \u2014 quite the opposite. Instability in the global \ncommodity markets has a direct bearing on our budgets \nand hence on our ability to finance our development. \nThe global downturn exposed the weaknesses in our \nfoundation. It alerted us to the need for change, the \nneed to establish the proper institutions for effective \neconomic management, institutions that will foster \nresilience and an ability to better absorb the blows of \nunexpected occurrences or outcomes.\n\nThe anxieties and concerns of the Ghanaian public \nare understandable. Like so many African countries, \nGhana has been through dark economic times, and our \nseemingly changing fortunes, with their uncomfortable \nfamiliarity, brought on a fear of regression. But this \nwas merely a setback, only a slight reversal. Already, \nthe home-grown measures of fiscal stabilization that \nwe have taken are yielding results. Only this month, \nGhana surprised its most ardent critics when it launched \nits third Eurobond for an amount of $1 billion. That \nsuccessful flotation represents a return of investor \nconfidence in the prospects of the Ghanaian economy. \nThat confidence is apparent in the recent rebound of \nour domestic currency, the cedi, which in the last two \nweeks has appreciated significantly against its major \ntrading currencies.\n\nLast year when I addressed the Assembly (see \nA/68/PV.12), I explained that it is not sympathy we \nwant in Africa; it is partnership, the ability to stand \non our own feet. In an attempt to establish such a \npartnership, we have entered into discussions with the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization \nthat is no stranger to the process of self-assessment \nand the implementation of change in the pursuit of \ntrue progress. Indeed, both Ghana and the IMF have \nevolved, and the partnership has the potential to bring \nabout the sort of transformation that will move Ghana \nfrom the ranks of the low middle-income countries into \na fully fledged middle-income country.\n\nThe coming year will mark the twentieth \nanniversary of the Fourth World Conference on \n\n\nWomen, which was held in Beijing in 1995. I would \nlike to note with pride that it will also mark the fortieth \nanniversary of Ghana\u2019s establishment of the National \nCouncil on Women and Development, which has since \nbeen renamed the Department of Gender. Ghana has \na long-held commitment to the betterment of women\u2019s \nlives, and my Administration has made it a priority to \ncarry on with that tradition. In fact, much, if not all, of \nwhat we are doing falls directly in line with the areas \nof concern enumerated in the Beijing Platform for \nAction of the World Conference. My Administration \nboasts one of the highest number of women appointed \nto public office in the history of Ghana. Seven of our \nCabinet ministers are women, as are the holders of \nseveral senior public service posts, and I hope that the \nfact that they are too numerous to list is an indication \nthat we are reaching towards the ideal.\n\nWe have submitted to Parliament an intestate \nsuccession bill, which ensures that if a spouse dies \nwithout having written a will, the surviving spouse will \nnot be dispossessed of their marital assets. We have also \nsubmitted to Parliament a bill on the property rights of \nspouses, which ensures that spouses are entitled to a fair \nportion of property acquired during the union. There \narea also several other pieces of legislation designed \nto offer protection for and empowerment of women, \nsuch as the Domestic Violence Act, the Anti-Human-\nTrafficking Act, an affirmative action bill and a gender \npolicy.\n\nI spoke earlier of isolation. Very few nations have \nexperienced the sort of exclusion that Cuba has suffered \nfor the last several decades as a result of the United \nStates embargo on that country. Ghana reaffirms its \nposition that this embargo should be lifted. Ghana also \ncalls for a halt to the establishment of settlements in the \nPalestinian territories. We have consistently expressed \nour support for a two-State solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian question, with the two nations coexisting \npeacefully.\n\nThis year the world\u2019s attention has been drawn \nto the urgency of addressing the growing problem of \ninequality and the threats that it poses to our unrelenting \npursuit of peace. I would also like to draw attention \nto the pervasive presence of religious intolerance. At \nthe root of all of the world\u2019s major religions is the call \nfor compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, peace and love. \nNevertheless, the use of religious dogma and extremism \nas a weapon of violence persists.\n\nIn this age of terrorism and political turmoil, of \nnational, regional and ethnic conflict, it may be tempting \nto use the actions of a few to justify prejudice toward \nmany. It may be tempting to combine the faithful with \nthe fanatical. But those of us who envision a just and \npeaceful world cannot, and should not, yield to those \ntemptations. Time and time again, history has shown us \nthat the changing of a world begins with the power that \nrests in the hands of the people, ordinary individuals. \nOr, in the words of one of the greatest teachers and \nleaders of non-violence, Mahatma Gandhi, \u201cYou must \nbe the change you wish to see in the world\u2019\u2019.\n\nToday our Jewish brothers and sisters are \ncelebrating Rosh Hashanah, their New Year. To them, \nI say, \u201cL\u2019shana Tova.\u201d Next week, our Muslim brothers \nand sisters will be celebrating Eid al-Adha, the Festival \nof the Sacrifice. To them, I say, \u201cEid Mubarak.\u201d And, \nto you, Mr. President, I say, \u201cMany thanks for the \nopportunity and for your kind attention\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "Myriam Riva, Emmanuel Riva, Dominique Sabrier, \nAlexandre Strens \u2014 these are the names of the four \npeople brutally murdered on 24 May in Brussels. Four \npeople were killed just because they were in a Jewish \nmuseum, an institution dedicated to culture, knowledge \nand intelligence. I named these four victims, but I do \nnot forget the thousands of anonymous victims of \nbarbarism around the world. For the abject act that took \nplace at the Jewish Museum in Brussels is connected to \nthe events sweeping the world right now. In Syria and \nIraq, as well as in countries like Algeria, terrorists kill \ninnocent people every day.\n\nSyria and Iraq are of special concern to us. There, \ndefenceless people, women and children are victims of \nmassacres, persecution, destruction and the theft of all \ntheir possessions \u2014 all because they belong to cultures, \nincluding the Muslim culture, that the terrorists do not \nagree with. Yet, no religion, and certainly not Islam, \nasserts that we must kill those who think differently. \nWe have to say this over and over again in order to \nremove any excuse for these criminals who sow terror.\n\nThe personal history of the alleged perpetrator \nof the attack against the Jewish Museum in Brussels \nresonates with all of us. It is that of a French jihadist \nwho visited Syria in the ranks of the so-called Islamic \nState. This jihadist then moved across Europe before \ncommitting the irreparable. It is common trajectory for \nmany of these foreign fighters. These foreign fighters \nare a threat to every country in the world. Security \nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), adopted the day before \nyesterday, is an important step towards a coordinated \nglobal response. We must and we shall put these \nterrorists in a position where they can no longer inflict \nharm.\n\nBeyond the humanitarian support it has already \nbrought to the Iraqi people, Belgium recently decided \nto send six F-16 fighters in support of the fight against \nterrorism in Iraq. My country also wants to strengthen \ncooperation among States. Belgium wants to intensify \nthe exchange of information at the European level and \nwithin NATO. As required by the Security Council \nresolution, a major preventive effort must also be made \nto prevent jihadist aspirants from reaching the combat \nzones. We must prevent the recruitment, training and \ntransportation of our citizens who may be tempted to \njoin terrorist groups. For minors in particular, each \ncountry must demonstrate a total vigilance regarding \nborder control.\n\nThe battle we are waging against terrorism reflects \na conflict between two understandings of life: respect \nfor human beings, which we have and the terrorists do \nnot; defence of freedom everywhere and always, which \nthe terrorists do not want; tolerance, while the terrorists \n\n\npreach and impose intolerance. For us, life is priceless; \nfor them, it has no value.\n\nWe know that military actions alone are not enough. \nHere, as there, what is needed is to focus on education, \neducational support, openness to others and the world. \nOur goal should be to deradicalize violent radicals. I \ncannot help but think that the human disaster we are \nwitnessing is also the result of a crushing defeat \u2014 that \nof politicians who favoured military solutions and the \nnotorious so-called preventive war.\n\nA few years ago, Belgium refused to participate \nin such an operation in Iraq. How can we not see that \nfrustration and humiliation have further strengthened \nradicalism? Things being what they are, we must \nnow deal with the emergency, and act, including \nmilitarily. But we must also consider the future and \ninvest sustainably in civil action. Everywhere, the \nestablishment of a State that protects its citizens must \nbe the priority. Strengthening the rule of law and \nimproving living conditions is the best crisis prevention. \nSuch responses are also much less expensive than the \nday-to-day management of uprisings and violence. In \nmany crises today, we see the States concerned in a \nposition of great weakness or even virtual failure.\n\nThe appointment of a new Prime Minister in Iraq \nsends the right signal of inclusion and tolerance. Let \nme mention other illustrations of this principle. With \nregard to the Middle East, this summer we watched \nin despair the launching of rockets in Israel and the \nmassive bombing of Gaza. More than 2,100 Palestinian \nand 67 Israeli lives were lost in combat. War is not a \nsolution. There is no other way to achieve peace \u2014 one \nbased on two States coexisting in security \u2014 except by \nreturning to negotiations. The status quo is obviously \nnot an option. We must put the settlement of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict back at the top of the international \nagenda. That settlement will also constitute an \nimportant factor in the stabilization and peace of the \nentire region and the world. Therefore, we welcome the \nefforts of President Obama in that regard, and we hope \nthat he will continue up to the last day of his mandate \nto work in that direction.\n\nThe Arab Spring is another example of what I \nam talking about. It was a legitimate revolution and it \nspeaks to true aspirations for democracy and prosperity. \nWe must note that in some countries, chaos and terror \nhave long reigned over democracy, while in others we \nare witnessing a return to State totalitarianism. In that \nregard, the international community must do everything \npossible to encourage democracy peace and prosperity.\n\nWith regard to Africa, with which Belgium shares \na long common history, it is in constant forward motion \nand far removed from common clich\u00e9s. We must \nstrongly support its economic, educational and political \ndevelopment. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nin particular in the east of the country, putting armed \ngroups where they can no longer do harm is an urgent \nnecessity. In Sahel, Mali and the Central African \nRepublic, the fight against religious extremism is \nwhere our priorities should lie. We must also mobilize \nto support populations in Africa that are dealing with \nthe horrific Ebola epidemic.\n\nOn the fringes of Europe, we are seeing a broad \ndestabilization. Internationally recognized borders are \nbeing violated, and Ukraine is facing a major challenge \nto be inclusive and representative for both the minorities \nand the majority of the population in Ukraine.\n\nWith regard to Flight MH-17, in which six \nBelgian citizens died, the currently known facts are \nincriminating and we eagerly await the final report of \nthe independent experts, who must have free access to \nthe site and responses to all of their requests.\n\nWe will have peace only if tolerance triumphs \nover barbarism. And we must act together. Therefore, \nI welcome the American initiative to launch a process \nof reflection on the role of the United Nations in \npeacekeeping. The role of the United Nations in the \nprevention and settlement of conflicts is irreplaceable. \nIt is the only place where the representatives of the entire \nworld can talk to each other. To be sure, the functioning \nof the Organization should evolve and recognize that \nthe right to veto has sometimes been used to prevent \naction from being taken. I am open to the consideration \nthat has begun in that regard. However, the common \nhouse that is the United Nations should be preserved at \nany price and encouraged to act. That is why I would \nlike to thank our Secretary-General for his unwavering \nefforts to further improve its functioning.\n\nOur world continues to present us with insufferable \ncontrasts. Too many human beings are today living in \nextreme poverty. They do not have safe access to water or \nbasic health services and they suffer from malnutrition. \nWho can believe that people will resign themselves to \nsuch a situation and that there will not be yet another \nscandal if they do? The international community \u2014 the \nGroup of Seven and the Organization for Economic \n\n\nCooperation and Development \u2014 are beginning to deal \nwith tax evasion. That is extremely important, as is the \nfight against corruption. There will not be great human \nprogress without a moralization of finance at the global \nlevel. Our responsibility in that regard is huge.\n\nToo many women and men do not have access to \na job or to housing, only because they are of foreign \norigin. Too many women are subject to moral or \nphysical violence only because they are women. Too \nmany people \u2014 lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals and \ntransgender people \u2014 are persecuted and rejected only \nbecause they are different or they love differently. It \nis also our responsibility to denounce and combat all \ntogether and systematically those injustices and attacks \non human rights.\n\nAs a crossroads of many cultures, Belgium has \nalways been one of the most open countries in the \nworld. It has a high standard of living. And although \nI think they are still too great, the inequalities there \nare the smallest in Europe. That is largely due to the \ncivil support, which is organized by the Belgian State. \nIn particular, our health system is exceptional and \nis accessible to everyone. Moreover, Belgium is a \nmulticultural country both through its demography and \nits abundant and diverse migration. In our country, the \nrespect for the other and the culture of compromise are \npart of our cultural heritage.\n\nBelgium, like the European Union, is moving on a \npath of solidarity with peoples who are encountering \ndifficulties. We want to help them to achieve their \nlegitimate aspirations for a more just world. We must \nalso remain vigilant so that we do not fall into the trap \nof social regression and increasing inequalities. All the \nethical progress that we have achieved is precious and \nmust be preserved.\n\nI will conclude by saying that human fraternity is \nnot a utopia. It is what has often allowed us to make \ngreat progress. We must go beyond borders to form \nnew types of cooperation, reduce inequalities and bring \nabout new hope. The most powerful obstacle to war \nand violence is human fraternity. It is that fraternity \nthat will enable us tomorrow to better share the \nplanet\u2019s resources, to offer a future to each and every \nchild and to make sure that peace reigns everywhere \nand for everyone. Members of the Assembly may rest \nassured that my country will continue to do everything \nit can to bring peoples together. We believe in sharing \nand solidarity, and we thus find it entirely natural to \ncontinue to support Member States in their many \nstruggles for peace and justice.\n"

        "file_text": "Humankind \nhas only one past, but many options for the future. \nHistory is such that we know only the consequences of \nthose actions that have occurred, but not those that did \nnot take place. What would our world look like today \nif, a century ago, that memorable shot had not been \nfired in Sarajevo, irrevocably changing the course of \nhistory? That shot set in motion a dynamic that has yet \nto be fully explained. For some key European countries \nthe question of honour contained in that shot overrode \nboth common sense and all other considerations. \nMillions paid with their lives for that hypocritical \nhonour. Unfortunately, the tragedy did not end there, \nbecause the lessons of the First World War have not \nbeen learned. As a consequence, other global carnage \nhas claimed even more human lives. Thus, the shot in \nSarajevo marked nothing more than the onset of the \nbloodiest period in the history of humankind.\n\nFor Belarus, this period was also the bloodiest in the \nhistory of its people. Located at the centre of Europe, in \nthe very crucible of geopolitical interests, Belarus lost \na third of its population during the Second World War. \nEven today, with 20 years of unprecedented successful \nand stable development, we have not recovered from \nthat immense loss, either physically, psychologically or \nemotionally.\n\n\nThis year, as the Republic of Belarus celebrates the \nseventieth anniversary of its liberation from the Fascist \noccupiers, is very important and symbolic for the \ncountry. Belarus remembers all the victims who paid \nwith their lives for the freedom of the nation. Against \nthis background, we do not understand and strongly \ncondemn some attempts to revise the outcome of the \nSecond World War, downplaying the significance of the \nGreat Victory or desecrating the memory of the fallen \nheroes. The world community must not allow this to \nhappen. Indeed, the verdict of history is unequivocal; \nif humankind fails to learn the lessons from past \ntragedies, we are bound to repeat them in the future.\n\nLet us ponder the the immediate and distant future, \nand indeed the present, as we mark the centenary of the \noutbreak of the First World War. What do current global \ntrends tell us about the future? Undoubtedly, a multitude \nof factors determine the dynamics of contemporary \nglobal politics. We would identify the resistance of the \nmajority of the world\u2019s population to the imposition of \nexternal influences as one of the key factors. Indeed, \nmuch like in the past, the mighty of the world persist in \nbelieving that only their vision and their development \nmodel stand as universal. Therefore, they do not ask \nothers whether they like or dislike, for instance, so-\ncalled liberal democracy or the Washington consensus. \nOthers are just forced to choose \u2014 either they accept \nour recipes or face the consequences, such as threats, \nsanctions and colour revolutions.\n\nTo be honest, we \u2014 that is, the majority \u2014 have \ngrown accustomed to alien political and economic \nmodels being foisted upon us. We know what is going \nhere. Someone wants our nations to feed transnational \ncorporate capital, not ourselves. If we resist, we are \npunished. The pretext is always contrived \u2014 alleged \nviolations of human rights by unruly States. Having \nbeen subjected to external attacks for many years, \ncountries such as Belarus, Cuba, Iran and Venezuela \nfeel such pressure especially acutely.\n\nNo less dangerous, however, is another factor. \nSimilar attempts at imposition have been made recently \nagainst our identity. Indeed, some have been doing their \nbest to impose on us extraneous cultural preferences. \nFor example, we are being forced to renounce the \nvalues of a traditional family and recognize instead \nthe diversity of that institution\u2019s forms. In other words, \nthey are striving to strip us of our own soul. That may \nbe just another way to subdue those who dissent against \ncapital by turning them into soulless slaves.\n\nWe are convinced that nothing will come out of \nit, however. The reason why the world is developing \nis because it is diverse. It is diversity itself that gives \nrise to healthy competition and creativity, which, in \nturn, drive human progress. Do we need uniformity \nand the ensuing trivial, soulless world? Of course we \ndo not. In that regard, I appeal to those who persist in \ncompelling others to do something that they find alien \nand unpleasant to give up their meaningless and futile \npolicy. It is a road to nowhere. Their efforts only divide \nus. We have too many problems on our plate that require \nus to be united.\n\nToday, two approaches determine international \nrelations: the ability to effect change and the ability to \nstand in its way. Indeed, on the one hand, one or even \nseveral countries can easily paralyse the international \ncommunity in its activities; on the other, no State or \ngroup of States, however powerful, can alter the status \nquo without cooperating with the rest of the world. \nThat is the paradox of globalization. We have become \ntoo intertwined and too interdependent. Sadly, the \nsame holds true for global challenges \u2014 they too have \nbecome intertwined. It is impossible in today\u2019s world to \nsucceed in one area without making headway in others. \nThere is, for instance, no simple solution to the threat \nof human trafficking unless we effectively tackle the \nproblem of poverty.\n\nIn short, strategies and policies to counter all \ncontemporary threats will be effective only if they are \ncomprehensive in scope and focus. Let us be realistic \nand acknowledge that we will never solve the world\u2019s \nproblems all at once. Our collective goal must therefore \nbe to reduce the extent of the threat they pose to society \nthrough our constant, unswerving attention.\n\nIt is precisely that attitude that must underpin our \ncollective effort aimed at developing the post-2015 \nUnited Nations development agenda. That agenda \nshould be both comprehensive and realistic. Its main \ngoal should be to make globalization more even and \nequitable than it has been up to now. When people in \ndifferent countries take to the streets to protest against \nglobalization, they are not calling for a return to \nparochial nationalism. Rather, they seek a strengthened \nglobalization; they want to make it sustainable and they \nwant it to result in a win-win situation.\n\nRising inequality in the world is the biggest \nscourge. We face a paradox. Having recently made \nsignificant progress in strengthening various forms \nof equality, such as gender, race and ethnic equality, \n\n\nwe are seeing a stubborn rise in economic inequality. \nThe international community must do whatever it takes \nto reverse that trend. Otherwise, we will not eradicate \npoverty. Climate change is another major challenge. \nIt is inextricably linked to such issues as energy \nconsumption, food security and water resources. We \nneed to fully reflect this complex issue in the future \nagenda.\n\nTo be sure, many other sectors must also be \nrepresented in this comprehensive document. In \nthat context, Belarus attaches particular importance \nto the struggle against human trafficking and the \nstrengthening of the institution of the traditional family. \nIn the light of the significant and recognized advances \nwe have made at the national level, we propose for the \nconsideration of our partners specific, effective, long-\nterm solutions to those vital issues at the global level.\n\nWe need to be thinking right now about how we \nwill implement the future agenda. We are certain that \nit should be carried out through the tool of thematic \nglobal partnerships. In this day and age of multiple \nactors and multiple threats, only effective partnerships \namong States, international organizations, civil society \nand the private sector can deliver success in addressing \nglobal problems. The State must, of course, remain the \ncentral pillar among all other partners. Moreover, what \nis needed is a powerful and responsible State. Only \nsuch a State can achieve the long-term complex goals \narising from the post-2015 United Nations development \nagenda.\n\nA powerful State often frightens people on the \ngrounds that it may potentially abuse its power and harm \nthe people. But let us take us a look at the other side of \nthat coin. How do people feel when they do not have a \npowerful State, when there is no one to protect them \nfrom resulting chaos, lawlessness and excess? I believe \nthat both the people of Belarus and their neighbours \ncan soberly assess arguments like these and draw the \nright conclusions. It is no wonder, then, that the world \ncommunity selects stable and internally coherent States \nlike Belarus to serve as a stage for addressing acute \ninternational crises. The people of Belarus very much \nvalue stability and successful development. We are \nconvinced that those factors make us a fully responsible \nstakeholder in the implementation of the future global \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nThe United Nations should play a special role in \nimplementing the agenda. It is this universal forum \nwhere Governments and their partners seek to implement \nit. We are convinced that the Organization will be able \nto cope with the task at hand if it successfully adjusts \nto the constantly emerging realities of life. The issue of \nthe reform and revitalization of the United Nations is \nas acute as ever, not just in its traditional institutional \ndimension but also in conceptual terms.\n\nAs far as the latter is concerned, we believe it \nnecessary to give a serious thought to two problems. \nFirst, we need to look for practical solutions to numerous \nsituations where certain United Nations principles \ncontradict each other. Secondly, there is the problem \nof negative consequences arising from purportedly \nbenign international activities that are often undertaken \nunder a United Nations mandate. Far too often, those \nactivities seek to advance someone\u2019s political goals, \nand the sponsors care little for the consequences, \nincluding chaos, lawlessness and refugee flows. Iraqi \nKurdistan, for instance, stands as a typical example of \nsuch egotistical policy when it comes to the issue of \nrefugees. We hope that the issue will be tackled ahead \nof the next United Nations global summit.\n\nAs we look to the future, we would all be well advised \nto take to heart the words of the great internationalist who \nlived during the First World War, American President \nWoodrow Wilson, who said: \u201cThe interests of all nations \nare our own also. We are partners with the rest. What \naffects mankind is inevitably our affair.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Mr. President, \nyour country, Uganda, and the African continent on \nyour election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \nsixty-ninth session. My delegation and I pledge our \nfull support to you, Sir, in this important mission. I \nalso wish to congratulate Ambassador John Ashe for \nsuccessfully completing his term.\n\nWe are all bound by our moral duty and legal \nobligations to address the challenges confronting the \nworld today. We need to act in solidarity to promote \nglobal peace and security for the good of our nations. \nIn this context, I urge the United Nations and all Heads \nof State and Government to support the current peace \ninitiatives in the world, especially those in the Middle \nEast, the Central African Republic, Somalia, Mali, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic \nof South Sudan. We need to find appropriate ways \nand means to end these conflicts and many others in \nthe world, and to pave the way for all the nations and \npeoples of the world to live in peace and to enjoy their \nbasic rights.\n\nIn addition, the Security Council needs to be \nstrengthened to deal with new global challenges. \nTherefore, we support the call of the African leaders \nfor a comprehensive review of the Security Council \nto ensure that Africa and the other continents are well \nrepresented in this important international body, in \naccordance with the African position as stipulated by \nthe Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. This \nwill create a more inclusive Security Council and \nempower all the continents to play a greater and more \neffective role in promoting global peace and security \n\n\nfor the benefit of the human race. More importantly, it \nwill ensure that the Security Council continues to fulfil \nits purpose and be more able to achieve its mandate.\n\nThe journey of my people from conflict to \npeace, independence and freedom was costly. \nIt was characterized by economic and political \nmarginalization, a prolonged war, humanitarian \ndisasters, the loss of millions of lives and untold human \nsuffering. At independence, we acquired a country with \na multitude of challenges, ranging from weak national \ninstitutions and inadequate physical infrastructure to \nlimited human capacity and weak security mechanisms. \nWe are grateful the international community for its \nsupport and for continuing to provide humanitarian and \ndevelopment assistance.\n\nI have no doubt that the world has followed with \nshock and disbelief the violent conflict that erupted \nin South Sudan on Sunday, 15 December 2013, which \nwas plotted by my former Vice-President, who wanted \nto seize power by force. He was too impatient in his \nthirst for power. He did not want to wait for the general \nelections scheduled to take place in 2015, when he could \nhave sought a mandate from the people of South Sudan, \nas required by our transitional Constitution. The failed \ncoup and the ensuing rebellion resulted in the loss of \nmany innocent lives, the destruction of property and \ndamaged community relationships. However, the coup \nwas foiled, and the Government is continuing to defend \nthe country and the people against the rebellion.\n\nThe Government and the people of South Sudan \ntake this opportunity to thank the United Nations, \nthe African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority \nfor Development (IGAD) and the entire international \ncommunity for their prompt action to restore peace and \nstability in my country. My Government is unwaveringly \ncommitted to resolving the conflict peacefully, and my \nnegotiating team has been in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, \nsince January, talking with the rebels about peace, \nin order to close a dark chapter in the history of our \nyoung country and, on a new page, to pave the way \nfor us once again to embark on the difficult mission of \nsocioeconomic development, which our people urgently \nneed.\n\nWith the dedicated efforts of the mediators, \nwe were able to sign an agreement on cessation of \nhostilities between the Government of the Republic \nof South Sudan and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation \nMovement/Army in Opposition on 23 January and to \nreaffirm our commitment to the agreement on 9 May. \nMy Government has demonstrated its firm commitment \nto peace, has unreservedly honoured those agreements \nand is continuing to negotiate in good faith to find a \npeaceful solution to the conflict. However, the rebels \nhave violated the agreements too many times and have \nrefused to sign the Protocol Agreement, which is a \ncrucially important document signed by the Heads \nof State and Government of IGAD, including myself \nas a party to the conflict. That important document \nforms the basis for resolving the crisis peacefully \nand inclusively. Therefore, I urge the international \ncommunity to prevail on the rebels to sign the Protocol \nAgreement.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that the international \ncommunity is rightly concerned about the humanitarian \ncrisis and human rights abuses that resulted from \nthe failed coup and the rebellion. In that regard, my \nGovernment has ordered an investigation into those \nabuses and has also accepted to cooperate with the \nCommission of Inquiry formed by the African Union to \ncarry out investigations into allegations of human rights \nviolations. We are determined to hold accountable \nthose who are found responsible, as we do not condone \nimpunity under any circumstances.\n\nMy Government recently signed into law provisions \nto guarantee freedom of expression in the media. It has \nalso ratified three United Nations core conventions, \nnamely, the Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women; the \nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its first \nOptional Protocol; and the Convention on the Rights \nof the Child, the Optional Protocol on the involvement \nof children in armed conflict and the Optional Protocol \non the sale of children, child prostitution and child \npornography. Those are all positive measures put in \nplace to address some of the concerns.\n\nThe conflict in South Sudan is purely a political \nstruggle for power and not an ethnic conflict, as has \nbeen reported. The citizens displaced by the conflict, \nespecially in the three states of Jonglei, Unity and \nUpper Nile, have sought refuge in the neighbouring \nstates of Lakes, Warrap, Central Equatoria and Eastern \nEquatoria and in neighbouring countries. Those \ninnocent victims of the conflict urgently need and \ndeserve humanitarian assistance. We therefore thank \nthe United Nations, the Government of Norway and \nthe stakeholders for organizing the donor conference \nin Oslo, Norway, in May to support our humanitarian \n\nneeds. We also deeply appreciate and welcome the \nhigh-level ministerial meeting on South Sudan that the \nUnited Nations organized on 25 September as a sideline \nevent of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly, during \nwhich a number of donors made pledges of support. \nMy Government is fully committed to providing \nhumanitarian access and has taken the necessary \nmeasures to facilitate access for humanitarian agencies.\n\nThe conflicts within our two countries of South \nSudan and the Sudan tend to be interconnected. \nThat is why we in the Republic of South Sudan will \nexert increased efforts to strengthen relations with \nthe Republic of the Sudan. Our oil flows through the \nterritory of the Sudan. In the spirit of cooperation, \nmy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \nCooperation will soon commence more joint visits with \nhis Sudanese counterpart to donor countries to appeal \nand lobby for lifting and waiving the Sudan\u2019s foreign \ndebt, as was agreed in the Cooperation Agreement \nbetween the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of \nSouth Sudan. There are outstanding issues associated \nwith the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, especially \nthe final status of Abyei. The Republic of South Sudan \nand the Sudan are working through those issues with \nthe members of the the African Union High-level \nImplementation Panel mediation team and our other \npartners to find an amicable, peaceful solution with the \nSudan. 1 am committed to addressing those outstanding \nissues, and I am in direct communication with President \nOmer Al-Bashir of the Sudan to resolve those issues \nthrough dialogue.\n\nFurthermore, my Government and the people of \nSouth Sudan would like to state our appreciation and \nthanks to the countries that have expressed support for \nthe peaceful resolution of the conflict in my country, \nespecially the United States of America, China, Egypt, \nSouth Africa, the Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, \nNorway, the Congo and Namibia, together with many \nothers.\n\nMy Government is collaborating with the United \nNations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and other \nstakeholders, such as community leaders, political \nparties, civil societies and faith-based organizations, \nto build trust with the internally displaced persons in \nUNMISS camps and to encourage them to return to their \nhomes and their pre-conflict areas and resume their \nnormal livelihoods. With respect to our cooperation \nwith UNMISS, my Government would like to express \nits concern regarding the latest mandate of UNMISS, \nwhich has very serious implications for service delivery \nto my people. I note in particular that the new mandate \ndoes not allow UNMISS to respond to requests from \nnational, state and local partners for assistance in \nimportant activities connected with capacity-building, \npeacebuilding, disarmament, demobilization and \nreintegration, security sector reform, recovery and \ndevelopment.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the activities I have \njust mentioned are of paramount importance to South \nSudan, we strongly believe that the main objective of \nUNMISS is to support peace and reconciliation first \nand foremost. We humbly request the Security Council \nto reconsider its decision when the UNMISS mandate \ncomes up for renewal in November. Also, we would \nfurther urge UNMISS to engage in reorientation \nof its activities relating to the mandate of protecting \ncivilians and to shift from protection-by-presence to \nprotection-by-action. This is very important because \nthe presence of troops that do not move does nothing to \nsave the civilian population. It is vital that they become \nactive. They must also encourage those in UNMISS \ncamps to return to their homes. UNMISS needs to \nprotect the civilians in their neighbourhoods, not in \ncamps, because ours is a huge country \u2014 larger than \nFrance.\n\nThe theme of the current session is \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d. It is no surprise that the Republic \nof South Sudan, as a three-year-old country facing \nnumerous challenges, will not achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We commend the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Working Group for coordinating \nthe discussions on the 17 sustainable development \ngoals (SDGs), which will form the post-2015 global \ndevelopment agenda. It is vital that the SDGs focus \nnations\u2019 efforts on reducing poverty; ending hunger \nand achieving food security; addressing our health \nconcerns, especially those issues affecting women \nand children; promoting gender equality and the \nempowerment of women and girls; addressing the \nissues of access, equity and quality of education; and \ntackling youth unemployment.\n\nWe firmly believe that the attainment of the SDGs \nwill require strong, sustained partnership, collaboration \nand coordination at the international, regional and \nnational levels, and leadership from the United Nations. \nFor our part, we will spare no effort and will work in \nconjunction with the international community and our \n\n\npartners in the New Deal, as a fragile State member of \nthe Group of Seven Plus, to attain the new development \ngoals.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our \nsolidarity and support to the victims of Ebola in the \ngreater West Africa region, particularly in Liberia, \nGuinea and Sierra Leone. We acknowledge the leading \nrole of the United States of America in assisting the \ncontinent to combat the virus. It is vital that the SDGs \naddress such global health threats.\n\nThe Republic of South Sudan strongly condemns \nall forms of terrorism, including piracy, which has \nbecome a menace to international peace and security.\n\nClimate change is now recognized as a major global \nthreat \u2014 a threat that could wipe out planet Earth \nand the entire human race. I commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for convening the recent climate summit to \nfocus attention on this global problem, and I urge all \nthe members of the Assembly to heed the call of the \nSecretary-General and take bold action. I am pleased \nthat the SDGs cover environmental issues of concern \nto the international community, and I hope the climate \nsummit to be held in Paris in December 2015 will result \nin an agreement on a new global legal framework for \ntackling climate change. We must win the race against \nthe clock to save our planet and humankind before it is \ntoo late. To echo Ms. Gra\u00e7a Machel, tackling climate \nchange requires leadership, courage and ambition from \nall of us. Let us act in solidarity to create the future we \nwant.\n\nFinally, Sir, I reiterate my resolve to restore peace \nto the people of South Sudan, to fully implement the \ncooperation agreements with the Republic of the \nSudan, to provide unrestricted support to humanitarian \nassistance, to respect human rights and ensure \ndemocratic governance in my country, and to strengthen \nworking relations with UNMISS and all the members \nof the international community without exception. We \nwill work in unison to establish a safe, secure, peaceful \nand prosperous South Sudan.\n\nWe are all one in this world \u2014 whether strong or \nweak, rich or poor. Let us therefore stick together.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, Sir, may I join \nothers in extending our heartfelt congratulations to \nMr. Sam Kutesa on his unanimous election as President \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Mr. Kutesa \ncan count on my delegation\u2019s full support in the \ndischarge of his enormous responsibilities in steering \nour work in the months ahead.\n\nThe world is faced with multiple crises \u2014 violent \nconflicts in various parts of the world, terrorist activities \nby extremist groups, unprecedented epidemics and \nnatural calamities. At this time of turmoil, we, as \na family of nations, must rally around this world \nOrganization as a centre of multilateralism, upholding \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the universal \nprinciples of international law.\n\nWe need peace and development. We need to do \nour utmost to implement the right of peoples to peace \nas emphasized by the Declaration on the Right of \nPeoples to Peace, adopted 30 years ago at the initiative \nof Mongolia. We have consistently supported the \njoint efforts of the international community against \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Mongolia \nis a party to the majority of international counter-\nterrorism instruments. The seemingly unthinkable \natrocities committed by the terrorist group called the \nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant pose alarming \nthreats to regional peace and security. The international \ncommunity must take resolute action to defeat these \nthreats comprehensively and in compliance with the \nCharter of the United Nations.\n\nMongolia commends the Secretary-General\u2019s \nleadership in rallying international support and \nestablishing the United Nations Mission for Ebola \nEmergency Response to ensure a rapid, effective and \ncoherent response to the Ebola crisis. We support the \nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions to \nthat effect.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine should be resolved only \nthrough political dialogue, without the use of force. The \ncurrent ceasefire needs to be made more sustainable; all \nefforts towards finding a solution, including the Putin \nplan outlined in Ulaanbaatar earlier this month, as well \nas the Minsk protocol of 5 September and its follow-up \nmemorandum, should be taken into account.\n\n\nJust 25 years ago, Mongolia chose its development \npath, deciding to embrace the rule of law, democratic \ngovernance, a market economy and an open society. \nAlthough we are among the countries known as \nthe third wave of democratization, the transition to \ndemocracy was in many respects unique in Mongolia. \n\nWe made a simultaneous transition to democracy and a \nmarket economy. We made that transition peacefully. In \n1990, democratic parliamentary elections were not only \nthe first of their kind in the region, but they were fully \nfree and fair. To ensure inclusive growth and citizens\u2019 \nparticipation, a national policy on decentralization \nthrough direct democracy was introduced. As a \nresult, citizens are now able to directly participate in \nidentifying development priorities and allocations and \nmonitoring local budgets.\n\nTo identify a long-term development pathway \nand regain the confidence of investors, a number \nof multi-stakeholder events have been held in \nMongolia \u2014 the Economic Forum, the Business \nSummit and Discover Mongolia. In addition, new \nlaws, particularly on investment, investment funding \nand petroleum, and budget transparency, have been \nadopted.\n\nAt the international level, Mongolia served as \nthe Chair of the Fifth International Conference of \nNew or Restored Democracies and the Community of \nDemocracies. We currently chair the Freedom Online \nCoalition. It is the first time that an Asian country \nleads the Coalition. We support the Human Rights \nCouncil\u2019s decision that Internet freedom is a basic \nhuman right. As a staunch advocate of democracy \nand freedom, Mongolia will use its opportunity as \nchair of the Coalition to promote, both nationally and \ninternationally, an Internet that is free and secure for \nall.\n\nTo support emerging democracies, Mongolia has set \nup an international cooperation fund. We have nothing \nto preach, but we have experience and lessons learned. \nWe therefore shared with Kyrgyzstan our experience in \nparliamentary democracy and legal reform, and we held \ntraining sessions for Afghan diplomats and Myanmar \njournalists.\n\nMongolia highly commends the Secretary-General\u2019s \nleadership in galvanizing and catalysing global action \non climate change. Climate change is not a challenge \nfor the future; it is a matter of urgent Permanent \nRepresentativeiority today. Yesterday\u2019s United Nations \nClimate Change Summit 2014 offered world leaders a \nunique opportunity to voice their commitments to cut \nthe emission gap and to pledge their commitment to the \ntwo-degree scenario in the lead-up to the twenty-first \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate, to be held \nin Paris next year.\n\nBut that pledge will remain a mere ambition if it \nis not backed up by bold action and strong political \nwill. We are running out of time, but we cannot run \nout of planet Earth. The time to act is now. Moreover, \nthe Green Climate Fund needs to be made fully \noperational. If resources are actually transferred as \nan incentive to countries that reduce their emission of \ngreenhouse gases, that will have a multiplier effect. No \none country is immune to climate change. Even my own \ncountry, Mongolia, which has a centuries-old tradition \nof living in harmony with nature, is experiencing its \ndisproportionate effect. Conscious of that reality, \nMongolia has recently adopted a green development \npolicy. We expressed our support for the statement on \ncarbon pricing, and for the New York Declaration on \nForests to combat deforestation.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly has the \nimportant task of articulating the post-2015 development \nagenda based on the legacy of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In that regard, we look \nforward to a synthesis report by the Secretary-General \nPermanent Representativeior to the intergovernmental \nnegotiations for the sustainable development goals \n(SDGs) during this General Assembly session. We \nalso welcome the outcome of the Open Working \nGroup on SDGs and commend its hard work over the \npast 18 months. The United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development underscored the special \nchallenges facing the most vulnerable countries, \nincluding landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). \nHowever, we believe that the outcome document of the \nOpen Working Group could have better reflected the \nspecial needs of landlocked developing countries. We \nhope that the upcoming intergovernmental negotiations \nwill redress that situation.\n\nIn the run-up to the 10-year review of the Almaty \nProgramme of Action, in June 2014 we hosted a \nhigh- level international workshop, \u201cThe World \nTrade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation: \nImplications for LLDCs.\u201d We also joined the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on Dry Ports in order to \nbecome involved in regional connectivity. Facilitation \nof transit transportation, infrastructure development \nand reduction of trade barriers were among the issues \ndiscussed during the recent visits to Mongolia by \nPresident Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin. We \nagreed to expand our cooperation in those areas. Those \nagreements were reiterated at the first ever trilateral \nsummit that brought together Mongolia, China and \nRussia on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation \n\nSummit in Dushanbe earlier this month. The expansion \nof our cooperation with those two neighbours augurs \nwell for regional trade and investment and paves the \nway for enhanced economic collaboration with our \nother neighbours.\n\nMongolia is redoubling its efforts to join the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation, to become a dialogue \npartner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nand to constructively engage in the East Asia Summit. \nLast July we also signed an economic partnership \nagreement with Japan. Strengthening peace and \nstability in North-East Asia is one of our national \nsecurity Permanent Representativeiorities. We firmly \nbelieve that dialogue and open discussions enhance \nconfidence among nations. Following up on the \nUlaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security, we \nhave successfully hosted a series of fruitful platforms, \nincluding a meeting of women parliamentarians, an \ninternational research conference and a meeting of \nmayors from cities in North-East Asian countries.\n\nStability on the Korean peninsula is crucial for \nmaintaining regional peace and security. We support \nan early resumption of the Six-Party talks. As a country \nwith a declared nuclear-weapon-free status, Mongolia \nfirmly believes that the Korean Peninsula must be \nnuclear-weapon-free.\n\nIn a time of major geopolitical change, the United \nNations system must reflect new economic and political \nrealities. We need to accelerate the reform process, \nincluding the long-overdue expansion of Security \nCouncil membership in both the permanent and the \nnon-permanent categories. The issue of the Council\u2019s \nworking method is also important for all small States, \nwhich make up a majority in the United Nations.\n\nOut of 193 States Members, 105 belong to the \nForum of Small States. Of the 70 States that have never \nbeen elected as members of the Security Council, \n50 are small States, including my own country, \nMongolia. As a responsible member of the international \ncommunity, Mongolia has put forward its candidacy for \na non-permanent seat on the Security Council in the \nelections to be held in 2022, and is seeking the valuable \nsupport of its fellow members.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my \nconfidence that this session of the General Assembly \nwill be able to deliver a common development strategy \nbeyond 2015, a strategy that will inspire and guide us \nto work collectively towards a safer, more equitable and \nprosperous future in the years to come.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is our \npleasure, Mr. President, to congratulate you and your \nfriendly country, the Republic of Uganda, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-ninth session. We are confident that your \nvast experience in diplomacy will steer the work of \nthis session to a successful outcome. I would also like \nto assure you of the cooperation of the delegation of \nthe Sultanate of Oman in working with you towards \nachieving the cherished goals and objectives of the \ncurrent session, at the forefront of which is enhancing \ninternational peace and security.\n\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor, \nMr. John William Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, for the \nexcellent manner in which he conducted the work of the \nprevious session. We would also like to reiterate our \nconfidence in Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntireless efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations \nand improve its working methods so that it can respond \nin the best possible way to the hopes and aspirations of \nMember States.\n\nThe Middle East is going through a difficult \nphase as it grapples with several crises due to a lack \nof international consensus. We believe that the overall \nsituation in the Middle East requires a unified position \nto solve the crises, the most immediate of which is the \nPalestinian question, which no doubt lies at the core of \nregional conflicts. We note that while the Palestinians \nhave consistently shown willingness to enter into \na genuine partnership in peace with Israel, based on \nthe concept of two States living side by side in peace, \nIsrael has not demonstrated responsible cooperation \nas it continues to resort to military force as a tool to \nmaintain its security.\n\nSecurity and stability cannot be achieved through \nthe use of excessive force and the insistence on inflicting \nheavy loss of life, injuries and destruction on the largest \npossible scale. The path to achieving the security and \nstability that underpins economic and social recovery \ncan be realized only through the peaceful partnership \nof the Palestinians and Israelis. We now believe that \nthere is a chance to achieve that objective, following \nthe ceasefire agreement reached between the two sides, \nPalestinian and Israeli, in the Gaza Strip. We stress the \nimportance of the two sides sticking to the agreement \nin words and in actions and avoiding violations under \nany justification or pretext. In that respect, we call upon \nPalestinians and Israelis alike to resume negotiations in \norder to reach a just and comprehensive settlement that \nwould provide peace and security for Israel and that \nresponds to the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian \npeople to regain their inalienable rights.\n\nThe continuation of violence in the brotherly \nSyrian Arab Republic and its serious implications for \nregional and international peace and security require \nus to redouble our efforts to encourage the Syrian \nGovernment and the National Coalition of Syrian \nRevolutionary and Opposition Forces to return to the \nnegotiating table, based on the Geneva communiqu\u00e9. \nThe two parties should approach negotiations in a \npositive manner by focusing on areas of consensus and \navoiding negative aspects and positions with the aim \nof saving the Syrian people and sparing them further \nsuffering and tragedies.\n\nWhile we applaud the role of humanitarian relief \norganizations and agencies in helping the Syrian \npeople overcome their prolonged ordeal, we also call \nfor intensified efforts to facilitate access by relief \nagencies to all areas inside and outside Syria to provide \nthe necessary humanitarian assistance to the affected \npeople. In that respect, we look forward in confidence \nto the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy for \nSyria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to encourage Syrian and \ninternational stakeholders to reconvene the Geneva \nconference. We believe that the current situation is \nmore conducive than ever to this effort.\n\nMy country appreciates the efforts of the President \nof Yemen, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, to achieve \nsecurity and stability there. We welcome the agreement \nof peace and partnership signed by President Hadi \nand the political powers in Yemen, and we call upon \nall political partners, particularly Ansar Allah, to \ncomply with its provisions. We call on all political \nentities in Yemen to renounce violence and uphold \nthe outcome of the National Dialogue Conference as \nthe best available road map for resolving the current \ncrisis. We hope that the Yemeni presidency will take \nthe remaining important steps in the Comprehensive \nNational Dialogue, most notably the referendum on \na new constitution that would secure the rights and \ninterests of all Yemenis.\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman is firm in its principled \nposition regarding the condemnation of terrorism in all \nits forms and manifestations, regardless of motives and \njustifications. In that context, we condemn the terrorist \nacts perpetrated by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq \nand the Levant (ISIL). We support the recommendations \n\n\nof the Jeddah and Paris conferences, and the steps \nthe international community is taking to extend Iraqi \nauthority over all ISIL-controlled areas. We emphasize \nthe importance for the international community to \nstand united in freeing the Middle East from all forms \nof violence, extremism and terrorism. We also welcome \nSecurity Council resolution 2178 (2014) on the threats \nto international peace and security posed by terrorist \nacts.\n\nThere are a number of ways to prevent violence and \nextremism. These include the consolidation of good \ngovernance and sustainable development, which would \nallow all sectors of society \u2014 especially young people, \nwho constitute two thirds of the populations of Arab \ncountries \u2014 to work, innovate and actively participate \nin the decisions affecting their daily life. On this basis, \nthe Sultanate of Oman has established a complete and \ninterlinked system encompassing the principles of \ngood governance, including councils and institutions \nto protect society and young people and ensure their \nparticipation in the development process.\n\nIn that regard, my country has established the \nCouncil of Oman, composed of two chambers, the \nShura Consultative Council and the State Council. It \nhas also created municipal councils, whose members \nare popularly elected, to oversee local issues that \naffect the lives of the people in the economic, social, \neducational and other fields, based on the principles of \ngood governance and sustainable development.\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman has also come a long \nway in its national development. It has established an \nindependent judiciary, which has become a key element \nof the development and modernization process. It \nhas also established the Public Prosecution Office, \nwhich stands at the apex of the independent judicial \nsystem in the Sultanate, as well as the State Audit \nInstitution, whose role is to provide a secure and proper \nadministration to ensure better management of public \nproperties.\n\nIt has also redoubled its efforts to fight corruption \nand organized crime. In that respect, and in the context \nof its efforts to protect the country and its citizens, the \nSultanate has acceded to the United Nations Convention \nagainst Corruption, the United Nations Convention \nagainst Transnational Organized Crime and the \nthree protocols thereto. This system of institutions is \nbased on effective public participation in the policies \nadopted and implemented by the Government in order \nto enhance good governance in the framework of a \nmodern civic State, based on institutions, in order to \nachieve security, stability and sustainable development.\n\nRegarding regional peace and security, my country \nsupports the call for an international conference to \nestablish a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and \nweapons of mass destruction, in line with the resolution \nadopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference \nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons. My country calls upon States parties \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons, especially the depository States, to take the \nnecessary measures to achieve this goal in order to \nspare the region the dangers of tension, and to avoid \nconfrontation.\n\nIn closing, we would like emphasize that the \nSultanate of Oman has come a long way towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals in \nall fields and within the specific timelines set by the \nUnited Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "The \nAssembly will understand that I am speaking today \nwith particular emotion, because one of my compatriots \nhas just been the subject of a cowardly assassination in \nAlgeria by a terrorist group linked to Daesh. His name \nwas Herv\u00e9 Gourdel. He was a man full of enthusiasm \nwho loved mountains and thought that he would be able \nto pursue his passion by going to the Djurdjura area in \nAlgeria. He was captured, and he was decapitated. That \nis what terrorism does. And it does not do that only to \nFrance. Several days ago it was American and British \nindividuals subjected to the same barbarity.\n\nThat group \u2014 Daesh \u2014 does not strike only those \nwho think differently from themselves; they also strike \nMuslims, they strike civilian populations, and they \nstrike minorities. They rape, they kill. That is why \nthe battle that the international community must wage \nagainst terrorism knows no borders. The same flag must \nbe carried, that of the United Nations, that of the values \nfor which this Organization was founded \u2014 human \ndignity, freedom, the vision we must have of a world of \ntomorrow, a world of justice.\n\nFrance is fully engaged in this battle. That was \nthe case in Africa when it was called to Mali, where, \nfortunately, it was joined by many African and European \ncountries and now by the United Nations. France has \nbeen engaged whenever there is a risk. But today it is \nin Iraq and Syria where that threat exists. But it does \nnot concern that region alone, because the Daesh group \nhas decided not only to conquer territory, imagining \nthat it will found a State; it threatens the entire world \nby provoking attacks, organizing kidnappings and \nrecruiting fighters from around the world to train them \nand show them the barbarity of which the group is \ncapable, so they may reproduce that horrific terrorist \nmovement in our own countries.\n\nIt is because this threat exists not only for the \nregion but for the world that France responded to the \nIraqi authorities\u2019 appeal to provide them first with \nmilitary aid through the delivery of weapons this past \nAugust and also with aerial support to keep the Daesh \ngroup from being able to continue its advance. We want \nto weaken it. We want to quash it.\n\nBut we also know that as long as there is no \nsettlement of the Syrian crisis, all our efforts risk being \nundermined. So the challenge is not only to act against \nDaesh, but also to achieve a political solution. We in \nFrance support the democratic Syrian opposition. We \nconsider it the sole legitimate representative of the \nSyrian people. In that case, too, we will not back down; \nwe will not compromise because of threats. The Bashar \nAl-Assad regime deserves to be condemned because \nthey are complicit in what has been going on for the \npast three years in Syria \u2014 200,000 deaths and so \nmany displaced persons.\n\nThis is a sad time for France, with the death \u2014 the \nmurder \u2014 of one of our citizens, but France will never \ngive in to blackmail, pressure or barbarous acts. On the \ncontrary, France knows what is expected of it. France \nknows that it upholds values, France knows it has a role \nto play and will never abandon that role, and that the \nfight against terrorism will be continued and expanded \nas much as necessary within respect for the rule of law \nand the sovereignty of States, for we make no mistake \nwhen we act. We will always act with respect for the \nprinciples of the United Nations.\n\nI also wanted to talk to about other things, but \nit must be understood that a great question is being \nasked of my country and also of the Assembly. When \nfaced with barbarism, with terrorism, will we remain \nspectators, or will we be actors together in what should \nbe a just international order? The question, if we do \nnot respond to it, or if we respond too weakly, then \nterrorists will continue their business of recruitment \nand indoctrination. It is not weakness that will be the \nresponse to terrorism; it is force \u2014 the force of law, \nthe force of the United Nations. At a certain point also, \nit will be the force of military action when it becomes \nnecessary.\n\nI also wanted to talk about other regions of the \nworld that are facing threats that also affect our own \nsecurity. I want to talk to the Assembly about the Ebola \nepidemic, because I know just how much it is affecting \nour African friends. But again, let us look beyond those \nwho are affected. Who can imagine that the epidemic \nwill remain confined to just a few countries if we do \nnot intervene? It is also a global threat. Again, the \nresponse must be a global. Therefore, France, Europe \n\n\nand the world must provide to the countries affected by \nthe epidemic the necessary medical care, indispensable \nprotection and economic assistance that is expected. \nBecause again, if there is the slightest weakness, the \nslightest failure to show solidarity, all of our countries \nwill be affected.\n\nI have also come here before the General Assembly \nto speak about what is happening in Europe and next to \nEurope, to speak about what occurred in Ukraine and \nthe failures there to uphold principles of international \nlaw. But what is at stake today, even in Europe, is peace \nand ensuring that the ceasefire that was agreed can be \ntransformed into a lasting solution to the conflict.\n\nNo continent has been spared from any threat. \nEverything is fragile, everything is precarious, \neverything is vulnerable. We have to have the same \nawareness of the risks, the dangers and the perils that \nwe had right after the Second World War. We must not \nthink that all we have to do is remember; we have to \nthink of the future, of the world we want. The world \nthat we want is the final subject I wish to address here.\n\nThe world that we want has to be one of profound \nchange. The present disorder also threatens not only \nour generation but naturally those that will follow \nus. It threatens our very security, as there are more \ndisplaced persons resulting from climate imbalance \nthan from wars, which are sadly so intense and deadly \non our planet. France has lived up to its responsibilities \nin that area too. We decided to organize the climate \nconference in December 2015. I am pleased that thanks \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, there was a summit \nhere that mobilized awareness, States, financial \ninstitutions, businesses and civil society. Many events \ntook place. We have to succeed at the Paris conference, \nnot because it will take place in Paris, but because it is \nthe world\u2019s appointment with itself.\n\nThere are periods in history when we have the \npower to decide, and decide not just for ourselves but \nfor humankind. This is one of those moments. Therefore \nin Paris, we have to do everything can be done to reach \na comprehensive, binding agreement that differentiates \naccording to levels of development, everything so that \nthere can be that Green Climate Fund, to which France \nhas contributed $1 billion for the coming years. I hope \nthat other countries follow our example, because we \nneed that Green Fund to allow less developed countries \nto grow and to succeed in their energy transition at the \nsame time.\n\nThis is a sad moment that I am living today on \nbehalf of France, that the French are experiencing, but \nit is also a moment of awakening and responsibility. For \nthe world, for the planet, we must fight terrorism, we \nmust act in favour of peace, we must reduce inequalities, \nwe must also do our duty for future generations. We \nmust ensure that the Paris conference is successful \nfor the sake of the climate. We must make certain that \nthe United Nations can remain faithful to the mandate \ngiven to it after a war \u2014 a terrible war. We are still \nfacing challenges, but we are certain to meet them if we \nare united and come together to claim victory."

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Sam \nKutesa on his election as the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. I assure him that \nhis priorities \u2014 the revitalization of the General \nAssembly, sustainable development, climate change \nand the peaceful settlement of disputes \u2014 are also our \npriorities. Our delegation will extend its full support to \nhim in order to achieve those objectives.\n\nI also pay tribute to Mr. John Ashe for his effective \nleadership of the General Assembly during its past \nsession. We commend the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts \nto find diplomatic solutions to complex challenges to \ninternational peace and security. We appreciate his \nleadership in hosting the climate summit.\n\nExtreme weather patterns are disrupting world \neconomies. In Pakistan we have directly experienced \nsuch a calamity just recently. The monsoon floods \nin Pakistan have had a devastating impact. We are \nmobilizing all our resources and ingenuity to provide \nrelief and to ensure recovery. The international \ncommunity should intensify its efforts to move from \nawareness to commitments to actions on climate \nchange, which is wreaking havoc with economies, \nparticularly in developing countries.\n\nThis is a defining moment for the United Nations \nas it embarks upon the task of transforming the lives \nof billions of people by investing in sustainable \ndevelopment in the next 15 years. We are setting \nourselves the vital target of eradicating poverty by \n2030. To do that, we need to go beyond the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We need a new approach \nto eliminate conflict and violence and reduce inequality \nwithin and among nations. Only then will we be able \nto ensure healthy lives, empower women and girls, \nimprove the quality of education, create jobs and \nguarantee the supply of affordable energy.\n\nThe time is ripe for such ambition and action. The \nsustainable development goals crafted so far must \nbe woven into an overarching framework. We must \nprioritize them. First things should come first. Peace, \nstability and inclusive economic growth \u2014 all come \nfirst.\n\nAt the national level, we have launched our Vision \n2025, which puts people first. It is inspired by our \nFounding Father, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali \nJinnah, whose vision of a welfare State is based on the \nprinciples of justice, equity and responsibility.\n\nIn the coming decade, we will develop human and \nsocial capital through investment in education, health \nand gender parity; stimulate sustained economic growth; \nprioritize energy, water and food security; modernize \nthe public sector and encourage private-sector-led \nentrepreneurship. We have determined that regional \npeace and security, political stability in the country, \nthe rule of law and social justice are absolutely crucial \nfor the realization of those goals. Above all, we will \ncontinue to work for the promotion and protection of \nhuman rights.\n\nEnergy is key to economic development. Pakistan \nco-chairs the Group of Friends of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. The \nobjectives of the initiative are also our national goals.\n\nIt is my Government\u2019s aspiration and endeavour to \nbuild a peaceful neighbourhood by pursuing a policy \nof constructive engagement. In South Asia, our people \nhave missed opportunities for prosperity because of \nunresolved conflicts. We have a choice today: continue \nwith the status quo or seize the moment to resolve all \noutstanding issues and free up our shared energies for \n\n\ncooperation. To take this course of high statesmanship, \nwe need more, not less, dialogue and diplomacy. We \nneed to respect each other\u2019s rights and sensibilities. \nWe must have relationships based on equality, mutual \nrespect and transparency.\n\nWe were disappointed at the cancellation of the \nForeign Secretary-level talks by India. The world \ncommunity, too, rightly saw it as another missed \nopportunity. Pakistan is convinced that we must remain \nengaged in the dialogue process for settling disputes \nand building economic and trade relations. Let us not \nignore the dividends of peace.\n\nMore than six decades ago, the United Nations \nadopted resolutions to hold a plebiscite in Jammu \nand Kashmir. The people of Jammu and Kashmir are \nstill waiting for the fulfilment of that promise. Many \ngenerations of Kashmiris have lived their lives under \noccupation, accompanied by violence and abuse of their \nfundamental rights. Kashmiri women in particular \nhave suffered immensely. For decades, attempts have \nbeen made, both under United Nations auspices and \nbilaterally in the spirit of the Lahore Declaration, \nto resolve the dispute. The core issue of Jammu and \nKashmir has to be resolved. It is the responsibility of \nthe international community. We cannot draw a veil on \nthe issue of Kashmir, until it is addressed in accordance \nwith the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. \nPakistan is ready to work for a resolution of the issue \nthrough negotiations. Our support and advocacy for the \nright to self-determination of the people of Jammu and \nKashmir is our historic commitment and a duty as a \nparty to the Kashmir dispute.\n\nAfghanistan is going through momentous security, \npolitical and economic transitions. As always, Pakistan \nstands in solidarity with the fraternal Afghan people. \nI congratulate the people of Afghanistan on the \nsuccessful completion of the electoral process. We \nextend our warm felicitations and good wishes to the \nnew Afghan leadership. It is our earnest hope that those \nlandmark processes will culminate in the emergence \nof a stronger, more stable and unified Afghanistan. \nWe also hope that the process of inclusive Afghan-led \nand Afghan-owned reconciliation will move forward, \nthereby contributing to greater harmony, stability and \nprosperity in Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan remains committed to forging a deeper \nbilateral relationship with Afghanistan on the basis of \nequal security and shared prosperity. Our two nations \nconfront common challenges, which call for greater \ncooperation and understanding. In the past year and a \nhalf, we have consciously reached out to Afghanistan to \naddress difficult issues and build on convergences. We \nhave made headway in that effort.\n\nPakistan has launched a massive operation to \neliminate terrorism. Complementary counter-terrorism \nmeasures on the Afghan side of the border are essential \nto achieve optimal results.\n\nThis past summer, the people of Gaza were \nsubjected to mass atrocities by Israel. We condemned \nthe indiscriminate killings of civilians \u2014 which \namounted to genocide. From this rostrum, I once again \nconvey Pakistan\u2019s condolences and sympathies to the \npeople of Palestine over their continuing plight.\n\nWe welcome the ceasefire between Gaza and Israel, \nbut the next steps must also be taken. The blockade \nof Gaza must be lifted, Palestinian prisoners must be \nfreed and illegal settlements must be halted. The United \nNations should facilitate a just and lasting solution to \nthe Palestinian issue, based on the relevant United \nNations resolutions.\n\nWe call on all parties in Syria to renounce military \nand militant means and to hold dialogue to restore peace \nand stability in their historic land. The emergence of \nnew militant entities in the Middle East once again \nillustrates that terrorism is a global threat. This \nprimitive force in Iraq and Syria is an aberration, which \nhas the sanction of no religion. It must be countered \nwith unified and resolute will.\n\nWe condemn terrorism in all its forms and \nmanifestations. We are fighting the terrorism that has \nbeen planted on Pakistan\u2019s soil. Our valiant soldiers are \nlaying down their lives to take out terrorists and tear \ndown their evil networks. The entire nation is behind \nthem.\n\nIn the past 13 years, as a front-line State, we have \nmade enormous sacrifices in blood and resources. Tens \nof thousands of civilians have been killed or injured. Our \neconomy has also lost hundreds of billions of dollars in \ndirect costs and denied investment opportunities. Yet \nin that fight, each time a soldier falls, another takes his \nplace \u2014 proudly. It is the resolve of our nation to fight \nthis scourge to the finish.\n\nAt the same time, we have made a plan of action \nfor the relief and rehabilitation of nearly 1 million \ninternally dislocated persons. That includes a strategy \n\n\nto prevent the return and resurgence of militancy and to \ncreate a safe environment for local people.\n\nPakistan\u2019s strong commitment to peacekeeping \nis rooted in our foreign policy and in our belief that \nevery nation should contribute to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. Inspired by that ideal, \nPakistan has maintained high levels of participation \nin United Nations peacekeeping and has become the \nlargest troop-contributing country. We are contributing \nmore than 1,100 troops to the Central African Republic \noperation, despite the dire situation there.\n\nAs a responsible nuclear-weapon State, we \nwill continue to support the objectives of nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation and pursue a policy \nof nuclear restraint and credible minimum deterrence. \nPakistan is not participating in any arms race in the \nregion. Yet we cannot be oblivious to the emerging \nsecurity scenarios and buildup of armaments. We, too, \nhave the obligation to maintain a robust and reliable \ndeterrence.\n\nI would like to reiterate the need for an interlinked \nmechanism for pursuing nuclear restraint, conventional \nequilibrium and conflict resolution. To promote stability, \nwe are prepared to explore new confidence-building \nmeasures.\n\nPakistan has maintained the highest standards \nof nuclear safety and security. At the last summit at \nThe Hague that I attended, Pakistan\u2019s recent nuclear \nmeasures, especially the establishment of a centre of \nexcellence, were appreciated.\n\nPakistan is a State with advanced nuclear \ntechnology and more than 40 years of experience. \nPakistan is a mainstream partner in the international \nnon-proliferation regime. Pakistan also has a stringent \nnational export-control system that is fully harmonized \nwith international export-control regimes. Though a \nnon-member, we are abiding by their guidelines.\n\nPakistan ought to be a part of those export-control \nregimes, especially the Nuclear Suppliers Group. \nPakistan also qualifies for full access to civil nuclear \ntechnology to overcome its energy shortages and spur \neconomic growth.\n\nThe ongoing reform of the United Nations must be \ncomprehensive. We support a reform of the Security \nCouncil that reflects the interests of all Member \nStates \u2014 small, medium-sized and large \u2014 and not the \nambitions of a few. There should be no new permanent \nseats in the Council. That would be contrary to the \ndemocratic character of this world body. We want the \nCouncil to become more representative, equitable, \naccountable and transparent.\n\nWe meet here today on the cusp of a new era for the \ninternational community. Never before has the United \nNations embraced such lofty goals to banish poverty, \nstimulate development, protect the environment and \nfoster peace, as it will during this session. The future \nof our planet hinges on our decisions. Let us deliver \nthem with full responsibility and wisdom. Pakistan will \nassist the Assembly and the United Nations as a whole \nto make the world a better place for all humankind.\n"

To deliver \non that undertaking, we will require noble, ambitious, \nlegitimate and strong leadership, strong political will, \nconstant determination and insight so as to ensure a \nbalanced integration of the three essential pillars of \nsustainable development, namely, social, economic and \nenvironmental. What we have heard over the past few \ndays leads us to believe that it is feasible.\n\nHowever, as we prepare to embark on the design \nphase of the transformative post-2015 programme, we \nmust first complete a vital task. My delegation wishes \nto emphasize the need to ensure the full implementation \nof the substantial prior commitments we undertook. \nAccordingly, we want to make a heartfelt plea in favour \nof expediting the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In sum, I would reiterate \nthat Mali subscribes to the core theme of this session, \nwhich is relevant, thanks to its inclusive, universal, \nambitious and transformative aspects. The theme \nnot only includes all the essential components of the \noutstanding MDGs, but it also focuses on the sustainable \ndevelopment goals (SDGs), which will be based on a \ntransparent intergovernmental process.\n\nLike other delegations, African and non-African \nalike, that have spoken before me, I remain convinced \nthat the eradication of poverty by 2030 should be a \npriority target of commitments relating to the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda that we are to adopt. Fortunately, \nthe contribution of Africa to the current process is \nalready formalized in the Common African Position on \nPost-2015 Development, adopted at the African Union \nSummit in Malabo in June. That joint position makes \nsocial, economic and environmental sustainability the \nkeystone of our continent\u2019s development policy.\n\nBut the policy is also built on essential pillars, such \nas the transformation of economic structures, inclusive \ngrowth, science, technology, innovation, human-centred \ndevelopment, environmental sustainability, and natural \nresource and natural disaster risk management, as well \nas peace and security. Naturally, we strongly support \nthe African position, the relevance and rightness of \nwhich goes without saying. I also urge the international \ncommunity to diligently review the Common African \nPosition. The concerns of the continent listed in that \nposition statement were identified through a process \nconducted with care and precision.\n\n\nAs we approach the 2015 deadline, Africa is again \nfaced with a terrible epidemic of the Ebola virus, \nwhich has run rampant, this time in Guinea, Sierra \nLeone, Liberia and other countries of West Africa. The \nrapid onset and the scale of that new challenge have \nsorely tested all the public-health systems already in \nplace. The individual capacities of our States, which \nare fragile and in the process of being strengthened, \nwill not be sufficient to cope with the crisis. We must \npool our resources and redouble our efforts. We must \nattack the new epicentres. Today more than ever, it is \nimportant to adopt a common strategy to deal with this \nepidemic, which brings grief to numerous homes every \nday.\n\nI want to express our appreciation to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts, and, in these \ntimes of hardship, to assure our brother countries \nof our support and active solidarity. I also wish to \ncommend and thank various nations, including France, \nthe United States of America, China and Cuba, which \nimmediately responded with short-, medium- and long-\nterm assistance, provided swiftly and in a balanced \nmanner. The pledges made have laid a foundation that \nwill be instrumental, if not in completely overcoming \nthe challenge immediately, at least in mitigating the \npanic that has begun to spread in the affected countries.\n\nA year ago from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.15), \nI announced that my country, Mali, had rejoined the \ncommunity of free and democratic nations, with the \nfirm determination to write a new page in its history. \nI also announced the commencement of the dialogue \nprocess for peace and national reconciliation, which \nwe initiated in accordance with relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions and the Ouagadougou Preliminary \nAgreement, signed on 18 June 2013, between the \nGovernment and armed groups in northern Mali.\n\nSince that date, there have been significant \ndevelopments of a political and security nature \nrelating to the restoration of the authority of the State, \nthe protection of human rights, the development of \nhumanitarian action, the execution of the mandate \nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and the \ncoordination of development activities and partnership \nwith the international community. In that context, the \nGovernment of Mali has undertaken a wide range of \nactions, covering decentralization \u2014 that is to say, an \neven more radical devolution of powers previously held \nby the central Government \u2014 the promotion of national \nreconciliation and peaceful coexistence, development \neffectiveness in northern Mali, good governance and \ncombating corruption and impunity.\n\nThe momentum was strengthened by the \nGovernment\u2019s organization of a series of meetings and \nopportunities for dialogue, including the Open Forum \non Decentralization and the National Conference \non Northern Mali. Those meetings enabled all the \nnational stakeholders to come together, in an inclusive \nand participatory manner, and to identify structural \nweaknesses in our political and institutional systems, \nas well as to lay the foundations for new democratic \ngovernance. That will take into account the profound \nrealities of our society, such as its ethnic and cultural \ndiversity and the strengths that have enabled the \npeople of Mali to ensure and maintain, throughout \nthe centuries and despite all the vagaries of nature \nand recurring political uncertainties, their social \ncohesion, customary resilience and basic aspiration to \na continuous improvement of their economic and social \nconditions.\n\nToday, in Algiers, with the support of the \ninternational community, Algeria is facilitating \na process that weaves the threads of an inclusive \ninter-Malian dialogue into a comprehensive and \npermanent peace. We thank Algeria for all its efforts \nto help Mali. We hope that peace will be sustainable \nand lasting and thus respond to the deepest aspirations \nof our people. A first round of talks, held in Algiers \nfrom 16 to 24 July, has led to the joint signing of a road \nmap on the basis of consensus and a declaration of \ncessation of hostilities in the northern regions of Mali. \nThe Government and the armed groups in northern \nMali have since then continued their discussions on \nwhat is called the second phase. Those discussions \nshould lead to deeper negotiations on a common vision \nfor the future, to gradually provide lasting solutions to \nall the points of disagreement and start the final phase, \nbefore ending with a peace agreement that will finally \nbe reached by the Malians themselves.\n\nI would like to once again thank the African Union, \nthe Economic Community of West African States, the \nUnited Nations, the European Union, the Organization \nof Islamic Cooperation, Algeria, Burkina Faso, \nMauritania, the Niger, Nigeria, France, Switzerland \nand others, which I will not name but which deserve to \nbe thanked for their tireless efforts for peace in Mali.\n\nThere are also other challenges to which we, as the \ninternational community, must collectively respond, \n\nespecially in the Sahel region, which includes Mali. \nThe terrorist attacks carried out in Libya, Nigeria, \nKenya, Uganda, Tunisia and the Middle East, although \ngeographically spread out, in fact represent the same \nserious threat to international peace and security. Here \nI would like to pay a special tribute to the memory of \nthe French hostage, Herv\u00e9 Gourdel, who was recently \nmurdered in such a cowardly and brutal manner in \nAlgeria. The very same day, that same barbarity was \nillustrated in Mali, with the discovery of a decapitated \nhead hung up in a village marketplace. It belonged to a \nformer Malian soldier whose only crime was loyalty to \nMali and its Government.\n\nWe condemn terrorism, particularly when it is \ncarried out under the banner of religion. Islam has \nbeen present in Mali since the eleventh century, and \nit has been a tolerant and moderate Islam that is based \non humanism, the acceptance of others and the right to \ndifferences. That has nothing to do with the Islam we \nare seeing today.\n\nWe reiterate our profound gratitude to all those \nwho have worked for a return to peace and stability \nin our country. On behalf of the grateful nation of \nMali, we honour the memory of all the brave soldiers \nand civilians, from Mali and other friendly countries, \nwho have sacrificed their lives fighting against \nobscurantism, terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nThe 2012 political and security crises in Mali \nhighlighted the complex and multiple challenges \nfacing all countries of the Sahel in terms of security, \ngovernance, the protection of human rights and \ndevelopment. Those challenges require concerted and \ndiligent efforts by the international community. They \nshould be met with a comprehensive approach and \ntargeted mechanisms. In that regard, I welcome the \nadoption of the United Nations integrated strategy for \nthe Sahel, which offers a comprehensive and coherent \napproach to finding lasting solutions to the threats and \nchallenges that beset the Sahel.\n\nThe first ministerial meeting to establish a platform \nfor coordinating the United Nations integrated strategy \nfor the Sahel, held in Bamako on 5 November 2013, is \npart of that approach. After the meeting, the Ministers \nfor Foreign Affairs charged with coordinating the Sahel \ncountries agreed to hold meetings every six months with \na rotating chairmanship, which has been entrusted, for \nthe first two years, to my country, Mali. The second \nmeeting, also held in Bamako, on 16 May 2014, resulted \nin the adoption of the Malian chair\u2019s road map, which \nfocused in particular on coordinating the efforts of \npartners and the national and regional ownership of the \nvarious initiatives and strategies for the Sahel.\n\nAs a final note on this subject, I thank the bilateral \nand multilateral partners and the financial institutions \ncommitted to supporting the implementation of the \ntargeted projects and programmes within the United \nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel. We also thank \nthe Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the \nSahel, Ms. Hiroute Guebre Selassie, and Mr. Romano \nProdi for his efforts to reconcile the various points of \nview and to support Mali at the international level.\n\nMali remains firmly committed to the ideals of \npeace and stability, both within and outside its borders. \nI therefore welcome the progress achieved in terms \nof reconstruction and national reconciliation in the \nbrotherly country of Guinea-Bissau. The successful \nholding of presidential and parliamentary elections \nbolsters the restoration of constitutional order in that \nbrotherly country.\n\nRegarding the Central African Republic, Mali is \ndeeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian \nsituation there, and expresses its support for the United \nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \nMission in the Central African Republic. We hope \nits rapid deployment will put an end to the escalating \nviolence and thus protect civilian populations in that \nbrotherly country.\n\nWith respect to the Middle East, we are following \nwith great concern the developments in Syria, Lebanon \nand Iraq, where the offensives of the terrorist group \ncalled the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant threaten \nthe sovereignty of that country and the stability of the \nentire region. To the Palestinian people, we express \nour solidarity in action and continue to work for \nthe implementation of the relevant United Nations \nresolutions.\n\nMali remains firmly committed to the fight against \nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons and \nthe eradication of the illicit trade in such weapons. To \nbe effective, that fight must be make use of the relevant \nsynergies. The consultation and cooperation framework \nat the regional and international levels offers such \nan opportunity. Similarly, the Government of Mali \ndeplores the erosion of multilateralism in the area of \ndisarmament, in particular the prolonged paralysis \nin the United Nations Disarmament Commission. \nHowever, we welcome the adoption by the General \n\nAssembly, on 2 April 2013, of the Arms Trade Treaty \n(resolution 67/234), as it represents true progress in that \narea.\n\nWe note that the intergovernmental negotiations on \nthe reform of the Security Council have been ongoing \nfor two decades already. The main issues seem to \nbe the categories of membership, the question of the \nveto, regional representation, enlargement of the \nmembership, the Council\u2019s working methods and its \nrelations with the General Assembly. It seems to us that \nall Member States are now convinced of the need for \na reform of the institutional framework of the United \nNations in order to strengthen its legitimacy and ensure \nits effectiveness.\n\nHowever, no significant progress has been made \nin the specific case of the Security Council, despite \nrepeated calls from this same rostrum and multiple \nmeetings on the issue. Africa, despite the fact that it \nrepresents 53 of the 193 States Members of the United \nNations today, remains the only continent that does \nnot have a permanent seat on the Security Council.\nThis situation is at odds with the values of equality and \njustice that are the ideals espoused by our Organization.\n\nAfrica came up with and submitted a Common \nPosition that was agreed on at Ezulwini, reaffirmed in \nSirte and subsequently confirmed during several other \nsummits. This proposal, a fair and realistic solution, \ncalls for granting the African continent two permanent \nseats with the right of veto and five other non-permanent \nseats. It seems to us that the Council, thus reformed, \nwould better reflect the geopolitical realities of today\u2019s \nworld, and the historic injustice done to Africa would \nbe repaired.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like recall that we are all \ngathered here at the United Nations for the sake of \nan ideal and because of a universal desire for peace, \njustice and freedom. Millions of people around the \nglobe expect the United Nations to deliver peace, \nsecurity, development and international solidarity. We \nhave no right to disappoint them. As a community of \nnations, we have the duty and the means to succeed \nthrough collective awareness and the preservation of \nour common values. That is the price of guaranteeing \nfuture generations a sustainable development that would \nprotect them from the scourge of war and deprivation.\n"

        "file_text": "The year 2015 will be \na crucial one for the United Nations and the international \ncommunity. In the coming year, we will reach the \ndeadline for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals and adopt a post-2015 development agenda, \nwhich will include our sustainable development goals. \nIn 2015, we should adopt a new, legally binding global \nclimate agreement. And the international community \nwill also commemorate the seventieth anniversary of \nthe founding of the United Nations.\n\nAt this juncture, we have to ask ourselves to \nwhat extent we have achieved the ideals set out in the \nCharter of the United Nations, and what is still to be \ndone. We must also ask to what extent the institutional \nframework laid down almost 70 years ago is still valid \ntoday. Inequality, both among and within nations, is \nstill a matter for great concern. In spite of the constant \nreferences to the rule of law at national and international \nlevels, we still do not always have the possibility of \nrecourse to machinery adequate to resolving legal \ndisputes between States. \n\nWithin the United Nations itself, the principle \nof equality is not always honoured, whether in its \nconstitutional framework or in practice. The twin pillars \nof peace and security, on the one hand, and development, \non the other, as established by the Charter, have been \nundermined by the ascendancy of political issues at the \nexpense of those of development, which are still often \nseen largely in terms of safeguarding dominant interests \nrather than from a perspective of global cooperation. \nInequality and vulnerability are increasing in rich \nand poor countries alike. Unemployment, precarious \nemployment, lack of social protection, access to human \ndevelopment services and financial services are still \nmatters of universal concern.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda cannot be only \nabout human rights \u2014 civil, political, economic \u2014 at \nthe national level; it must also ensure that the right to \ndevelopment is upheld at the international level. As we \n\n\n\f\nwork on a new, comprehensive development agenda, \nwe must ensure that no right is ignored and no one is \nleft behind. The United Nations System Task Team on \nthe Post-2015 United Nations Development Agenda \nhas proposed that the transformative efforts to achieve \ninclusive, people-centred sustainable development \nbe guided by three fundamental principles \u2014 human \nrights, equality and sustainability \u2014 and have four \ncore dimensions: inclusive social development, \nenvironmental sustainability, inclusive economic \ndevelopment and peace and security. Mauritius \nis in broad agreement with those core principles \nand dimensions, as outlined in the Team\u2019s report \nRealizing the Future We Want for All, for guiding this \ntransformation at both the national and international \nlevels. \n\nThe war against Ebola demands robust action \nfrom all of us and requires exceptional international \ncooperation. We welcome the initiatives announced \nlast week, and we commit ourselves to giving our full \nsupport to addressing this global challenge.\n\nThe water we drink, the food we eat and the energy \nwe require are vital to meaningful development. It is \nestimated that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living \nin countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, \nand two thirds of the world\u2019s population could be living \nunder water-stress conditions. One in eight people in \nthe world today \u2014 842 million \u2014 are undernourished. \nApproximately 2 billion suffer from micronutrient \ndeficiencies. In 2030, it is estimated that food demand \nwill have increased by more than 50 per cent. In that \nregard, Mauritius supports the Secretary-General\u2019s call \nfor a Zero Hunger Challenge. Promoting sustainable \nagriculture must therefore be an essential component of \nthe new development framework. \n\nIt is also estimated that by 2035, global energy \ndemand will have increased by at least 33 per cent. \nCurrently, 1.2 billion people have no access to electricity. \nThose growing demands will make water, food and \nenergy crucial issues not only on the development \nagenda but also in the wider context of international \npeace and security. The international community should \nsupport developing countries, particularly vulnerable \ncountries such as small island developing States \n(SIDS), in their efforts to promote water governance \nand integrated water resources management, increase \nthe share of renewables in the energy mix and improve \nenergy conservation and efficiency.\n\nIn order to support global development, it is \ncrucial that we have an international regime based \non structured global cooperation designed to promote \ntechnology facilitation, and a technology facilitation \nmechanism established under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations could play a central role in that regard. \nIt is also important that the international community \nrecognize the vital role of women and young people and \ntheir enhanced participation and leadership in all areas \nof sustainable development. Promoting gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment should be a core issue on \nthe post-2015 development agenda. All sections of the \npopulation should be at the heart of a people-centred \nvision of sustainable development.\n\nThe contributions of all the initiatives launched \nat the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20), including the Open Working \nGroup for Sustainable Development Goals, the \nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts on \nSustainable Development Financing, and options for \na technology facilitation mechanism, should feed into \nthe preparations for a 2015 development summit. They \nshould also be included in the Secretary-General\u2019s \nsynthesis report. The deliberations of the Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, mandated by the Rio+20 outcome document \n(resolution 66/288, annex), should be reflected in the \nsynthesis report and the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nSince accountability is essential to assessing \nprogress, the post-2015 development agenda should \nalso include an accountability framework that would \nbe universal but flexible enough to take into account \ndifferent capacities and responsibilities. And we need \nmore accountable and equitable global economic \ngovernance that ensures wider, more inclusive \nparticipation in decision-making. The United Nations, \ngiven its universal membership, should assume \nleadership and a proactive role in promoting sound \nand equitable governance in a more resilient global \neconomic architecture.\n\nBeyond those immediate concerns, there are a \nnumber of longer-term threats that may dramatically \naffect all of us, particularly SIDS. One of them is climate \nchange. Climate risks are real and must be addressed. \nFrom melting glaciers to more frequent wildfires and \nintense cyclones, flash floods, extreme heatwaves and \nocean acidification, the challenges are not a future \nthreat; they already exist. The latest report of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate \n\n\n\f\nChange 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, \nmade it clear that an increase in the world\u2019s temperature \nof 2\u00b0C would be dangerous, while one of 4\u00b0C would be \ncatastrophic. \n\nClimate risks are global challenges that require \nglobal solutions. Climate change poses risks to global \neconomic prosperity, development and security as well \nas to the environment. We must build on the momentum \nof the Climate Summit and use the opportunity of the \n20th session of the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in Lima, to raise the level of ambition \nin the lead-up to a new universal climate agreement in \nParis next year.\n\nThe strong connections between climate change \nadaptation and disaster risk reduction should be \nrecognized. No country is immune to natural disasters, \nbut it is the most vulnerable countries and people who \nare hit the hardest. Mauritius looks forward to a renewed \nand ambitious international framework for disaster risk \nmanagement that establishes disaster risk reduction as \na key element of the post-2015 development agenda. \nWe also believe that the exogenous risks of climate \nchange and natural disasters should be integrated into \nmainstream economic thinking and assessment of \nmacroeconomic risks.\n\nWe welcome the decision of the most recent \nCommonwealth Heads of Government meeting to \nestablish a Commonwealth climate finance skills hub, \nto be hosted by Mauritius. It will address critical gaps \nin building the capacity of SIDS and least-developed \ncountries to identify, access and manage climate \nfinance. The special circumstances, vulnerabilities and \nlow resilience of SIDS should be taken into account with \nregard to financing and trade issues. SIDS need special \nand differential treatment to access concessionary \nsources of financing for sustainable development \nand to effectively participate in multilateral trade. \nMauritius strongly supports SIDS-SIDS partnerships. \nSIDS can build on their commonality of interests to \nshare experiences, pool resources and act collectively \nin commissioning technology or formulating legal and \nregulatory frameworks, for instance.\n\nThe oceans are the new frontier for economic \ndevelopment. For SIDS in particular, they are the \nbest scope for expanding economic space. Following \na national dialogue on the ocean economy, the \nGovernment of Mauritius has published the Road Map \nfor the Mauritian Ocean Economy. The Road Map sets \nout the vision, goals and strategies for the development \nand expansion of a new pillar of our economy. In order \nto provide the best possible conditions for investors to \noperate and create wealth, Mauritius is putting in place \nan enabling environment that will support our ocean \neconomy through an integrated and holistic approach to \nensure coherence and balance among economic growth, \nsocial development and environmental protection.\n\nPromoting the ocean economy will unleash the \npotential for SIDS with respect to all ocean-related \neconomic activities, both onshore and offshore. It will \nalso enable them to enhance their nations\u2019 food security, \nharness the winds and waves for their energy needs, \ndevelop new ocean-related industries and services that \nwill create opportunities for entrepreneurs and youth \nemployment.\n\nIt is essential that we strike a balance between \nthe various uses of the oceans and the need to protect \nour oceans. At the third International Conference on \nSmall Island Developing States, held in Samoa, the \ninternational community agreed to build upon existing \npartnerships and promote new ones in order to expand \nthe economic space of large ocean States. We wish to \nreiterate our call for the United Nations to adopt a global \noceans strategy that will be the operational counterpart \nto the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea (UNCLOS). While it will be for individual States \nto decide on their own ocean economy policies, the \nglobal ocean strategy will provide an overall vision and \nframework for the sustainable development of ocean-\nrelated economic activities for policymakers, investors \nand all stakeholders.\n\nThe situation in the Middle East and in certain parts \nof Africa could not only have dramatic consequences \nfor the people of these regions, but also impact on global \ndevelopment and peace. We urge the international \ncommunity to spare no effort in resolving the plight \nof the people of Palestine. Mauritius supports the two-\nState solution to the conflict. The people of the State \nof Palestine have suffered for too long from the grave \ninjustice done to them, and must be allowed to live in \ndignity and peace within recognized borders.\n\nIf it is to remain credible and play the constructive \nrole it can and must play in the new world order, \nthe United Nations must respond to the call of its \nmembership for reform. We have a duty to engage in \nmeaningful discussions on the reform of the Security \nCouncil, the revitalization of the General Assembly and \nthe working methods of our Organization. Mauritius \n\n\n\f\nreaffirms its commitment to the African Common \nPosition that reform of the Security Council should \ninclude expansion in the permanent and non-permanent \ncategories alike. The historical injustice done to Africa \nshould be redressed, and Africa should be accorded \npermanent representation on the Council. Latin \nAmerica also deserves permanent representation, and \nthe SIDS should be entitled to a seat on the Council. \nMauritius further reiterates its support for India\u2019s \nrightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed \nSecurity Council.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, when a wave of decolonization \nwas sweeping across the world, the United Kingdom \npurported to create a new colony, the so-called \nBritish Indian Ocean Territory, by carving out part \nof the territory of Mauritius. Thus, part of Mauritian \nterritory remains under colonial rule. As long as part \nof Mauritian territory remains under colonial rule, the \ndecolonization of Africa will still remain incomplete. \nThe dismemberment by the United Kingdom of part of \nthe territory of Mauritius prior to independence was \nand continues to be a blatant breach of international law \nand total disregard of United Nations resolutions.\n\nSpeaking before the Assembly last week, President \nObama said that there was\n\n\u201cone vision of the world in which might makes \nright\u201d [but that] \u201cAmerica stands for something \ndifferent. We believe that right makes might, that \nbigger nations should not be able to bully smaller \nones\u201d (A/69/PV.6, p. 10).\nThis is why, last year in this very forum (see \nA/68/PV.18), Mauritius urged the United States to be \non the right side of history, and not condone illegal acts \nby maintaining its presence on Diego Garcia under an \nunlawful arrangement with the United Kingdom that \nhas no valid title to the island, but and instead to ensure \nthat, in the future, the United States presence is on the \nright side of the law.\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom \nshould recognize the sovereignty of Mauritius over \nthe Chagos archipelago, and engage in meaningful \ndiscussions with Mauritius in good faith over \narrangements to be made in that regard. Following \nthe statements we have heard over the past year with \nregard to sovereignty and territorial integrity, there \nshould not be one set of standards for one part of the \nworld and a different one for another part of the world. \nThose who show no respect for fundamental principles \nacross the board lose all moral authority to preach to \nthe rest of the world. Following bilateral discussions \non Tromelin, which forms an integral part of the \nterritory of Mauritius, Mauritius and France agreed on \ninterim measures without prejudice to the sovereignty \nof Mauritius. An agreement reached in a spirit of \ncooperation and dialogue is a step in the right direction.\n\nAs we embark on a new session that could herald \na new chapter in the history of the United Nations, \nwe should renew our commitment to multilateral \ncooperation for peace, development and prosperity for \nall nations in the new agenda to be adopted next year.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to \noffer my sincere condolences to the French Government \nfor the cowardly murder of one of its citizens yesterday, \n24 September, in Algeria by the so-called Soldiers of \nthe Caliphate.\n\nSociopolitical crises, religious extremism, armed \nconflict, terrorism, cross-border crime, identity politics, \ndevelopment issues, the effects of climate change and \npandemics such as that currently caused by the Ebola \nvirus are now concerns of the utmost importance \nthat are crying out for action from all players of the \ninternational community.\n\nIn order to meet the challenges of promoting \npeace, stability, security and development, we have to \nfurther strengthen the spirit of sharing and solidarity. \n\u201cDelivering on and implementing a transformative \npost-2015 development agenda\u201d, which the Assembly \nhas identified as the theme of the general debate of the \nsixty-ninth session, provides a good link with the theme \nof last year\u2019s session. That gives us an opportunity \nonce again to further explore the questions that are \nof concern to all of us. It is nearly post-2015 already, \nand crafting a programme that goes beyond that date \nrequires that we take stock of the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\n\nDespite the remarkable progress in the \nimplementation of some of those goals, it is now clear \nthat there are still vast gaps in other goals, which will \npersist when the programme is concluded. With respect \nto the Niger, for example, the implementation of the 3N \nInitiative, \u201cLes Nig\u00e9riens nourrissent les Nig\u00e9riens\u201d, \nhas already allowed us to achieve target C of MDG 1, \nwhich has to do with reducing by half the number of \npeople who are suffering from hunger. The Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations has \nrecognized that, in that area, the Niger has achieved \nimpressive results in record time. Our country has \nalso achieved target A of MDG 6, with an HIV/AIDS \nprevalence rate of 0.4 per cent in 2012, as compared \nwith a target of 0.7 per cent in 2015.\n\nWith respect to reducing by half the proportion of \npeople whose income is less than $1 per day, ensuring \nprimary education for all, strengthening gender \nequality and the empowerment of women, dealing with \nthe mortality of children under five years, reducing \nmaternal mortality and promoting a sustainable \nenvironment, major efforts have ben undertaken. Still, \nthose goals will most likely not be achieved, despite the \n\nimplementation of the programme of recovery currently \nunder way since my election in 2011.\n\nIn drafting the new post-2015 agenda, we naturally \nneed to maintain all of the unachieved MDGs and \nprovide for measures to avoid a deterioration in \nareas where the goals have already been achieved. \nFor example, the issue of the demographic dividend \nshould be a priority on the agenda. The demographic \ndividend, the Assembly will recall, consists of both \nthe demographic transition and inclusive economic \ngrowth. More specifically, the demographic dividend \nmeans, on the one hand, reducing maternal, infant and \njuvenile mortality and controlling birth and, on the \nother hand, providing for sustainable development with \nits three pillars: economic, social and environmental. \nThe demographic transition is needed to strengthen \nsustained growth, which in turn should accelerate \nthe demographic transition. I continue to believe that \nthe best contraceptive method, the best condom, is \nsustainable development.\n\nThe post-2015 agenda will be dominated by what \nI would call the three D\u2019s \u2014 defence or security, \ndemocracy and development. It is fortunate that the \ninternational community has now established a close \ncorrelation among those three fundamental challenges, \nwhich are interconnected. Global peace and security \ntoday are, however, threatened by terrorism, by \norganized crime, by demands based on identity and \nby the growth of inequality, which have led to the \nworsening of poverty around the world, from Iraq to \nLibya, from Syria to Nigeria and from Mali to Somalia.\n\nThe enemies who embody that terrorist threat \nare engaged in an unconventional and asymmetrical \ncombat. They are sending out propaganda through their \nactions and seek to control populations through terror, \nincluding rape; kidnapping young girls, as in Chibok, \nNigeria; taking hostages in exchange for ransom: and \nmurder. The war pursued against them is no longer \na conventional, industrial war of the kind for which \nour armies have been trained. Warfare among our \npopulations is not a new phenomenon, but in recent \nyears, it has taken on an exceptional dimension. To deal \nwith that situation, we need to change the paradigm and \nmove from a paradigm of classic conventional war to \nthat of the war that takes place among our populations, \nwhich, in turn, presupposes that our countries reform \ntheir armies. That also presupposes that our countries \ntrain special forces that are capable of adapting to the \nmethods of the enemy.\n\nIn order to eradicate the Islamic State or the \nAl-Nusra Front in Iraq and Syria, neutralize the jihadist \norganizations in Libya, overcome Al-Qaida in the Islamic \nMaghreb and Al-Mourabitoun in the Sahel, particularly \nin Mali, and oust the Al-Shabaab from Somalia and \nBoko Haram in Nigeria, the international community \nneeds to establish a shared goal and strategy, working \nwith the countries involved. The common political aim \nis to defend our democratic institutions and protect our \npeoples. The strategy would then necessarily have to \ndo with cutting off the sources financing terrorism, \nwhether those sources are States or the drug trade or \nthe payment of ransom. The strategy also needs to deal \nwith the terrorist strategy, which generates propaganda \nthrough its actions, and unfortunately, its propaganda \nis heavily covered by the media and social media on the \nInternet. In addition, a just settlement of the Palestinian \nissue could certainly contribute to the fight against this \nscourge.\n\nAs a neighbour of Libya, Nigeria and Mali, the \nNiger is deeply concerned by the situation prevailing in \nthose countries. In Libya, the international community, \ntogether with neighbouring countries, must establish the \nconditions that would enable it to neutralize the militias, \nreconcile all Libyans without exception and form a \nGovernment of union that would organize elections \nunder the guidance of the international community. The \ncurrent United Nations Support Mission in Libya must \nbe replaced by a more robust structure, and in this case, \na stabilization and institution-building mission. The \ninternational community will then have to undertake \na vast diplomatic initiative under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General to promote national reconciliation, \nwhich is needed to bring about the end of violence and \nchaos as well as to assist in the emergence of the true \nrule of law.\n\nWhatever the case may be, as the leader of a country \nthat is a neighbour of Libya and whose economy and \nsecurity have been seriously affected by what has been \ntaking place there for three years, my belief is that it is \ndangerous to leave the current state of affairs in play as \nit is. We therefore need to have the courage to radically \nchange our perspective and act so as to help Libyans \nrealize their sole aspiration, which is to live in peace.\n\nWith respect to Nigeria, Boko Haram has been \nextremely aggressive and has demonstrated a barbarism \nnever seen before, with its recent incursions into \nCameroon and the occupation of ever more territory, \ngoing so far as to threaten Maiduguri, the capital of \n\nthe federated state of Borno in Nigeria. It is evident \nthat that terrorist group has aims that are much \nlarger than had been thought. That means that more \neffort and cooperation are needed at the regional and \ninternational levels in order to deal with the problem \neffectively. It is in that perspective that the heads of \nState and Government of Cameroon, the Niger, Nigeria \nand Chad \u2014 the members of the Lake Chad Basin \nCommission \u2014 and Benin, will meet in Niamey on \n7 October 2014 to pool their efforts in the fight against \nthis serious threat.\n\nRegarding Mali, I welcome the inclusive inter-Malian \ndialogue that is currently taking place under the auspices \nof Algeria. I express the hope that the dialogue will lead \nto an agreement that respects the unity and integrity \nof Mali. In Mali, as in the Central African Republic, \nthe question of unity is essential. The Pandora\u2019s box \nof Balkanization, which has been opened elsewhere in \nAfrica, must be closed again if we do not want the rest \nof the continent to catch fire. The future of Africa is \nin its unity. The best way to do away with the borders \ninherited from colonization is not to create new borders \nalong ethnic or religious lines, but to go beyond current \nborders through integration.\n\nGlobal security can be ensured only by States with \nstrong and stable democratic institutions. The post-\n2015 programme must be a priority. Global security \ncan also not be guaranteed as long as inequalities in \ntrade between nations and income inequality within \nnations persist. Inequalities are morally unacceptable \nand economically inefficient. Therefore, the struggle \nagainst inequality has always been an essential question \nand one that we must stop avoiding, if we want a more \njust, humane and prosperous world. That struggle must \nbe central to the post-2015 programme.\n\nObservers are unanimous in saying that Africa, \nwith its high rates of economic growth, is the continent \nof the twenty-first century. That is true, but only if our \ncontinent definitively emerges from the unequal trade \nsituation and from the colonial pact that has always \ntreated Africa as merely a reservoir of raw materials, \noften sold cheaply, as in the old days when slaves or \nvast territories were acquired in exchange for mirrors, \npins, needles and other junk. The African continent \nwill actually be the continent of the twenty-first \ncentury when it, itself, works with its raw materials, \nthat is to say once it takes the place that it deserves \nin world industrial production. Africa will be the \ncontinent of the twenty-first century once its relations \nwith other nations are governed by equitable trade and \nnot by official development assistance. Africa will be \nthe continent of the twenty-first century when there \nis a huge middle class arising from good political and \neconomic governance, including a better distribution of \nincome to reduce poverty.\n\nCurrently, according to a study by the African \nDevelopment Bank, the African middle class, which is \ndefined as the proportion of Africans with an income \nbetween $2 and $20 a day, represents about 30 per cent \nof the population. Our ambition should be to increase \nthat number to 80 per cent. The vision contained in the \n2063 agenda of the African Union suggests that we are \non the right track. It is in the interest of the international \ncommunity to include priorities that are on the agenda \nof our continent in the post-2015 programme.\n\nThe twenty-first century must be the century when \nAfrica equips itself with roads and rail and energy \ninfrastructure and new information and communication \ntechnologies. It will also be the century of an agriculture \nthat feeds our population, which is growing larger, and \nthe century of access to water and sanitation services \nand to education, including vocational and technical \ntraining to enable each young person to have a trade.\n\nHowever, if our children and grandchildren are to \nhave a chance at having a better quality of life, we must \nmeet the challenge of climate change. In that regard, \nwe must congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \non his initiative to convene the Climate Summit. That \nconference\u2019s outcome will be the basis for the decisions \nthat the international community is called upon to \ntake at the climate conference to be held in Paris in \nDecember 2015.\n\nWe have the imperative duty to save our planet. The \nglobal temperature is increasing owing to greenhouse \ngases, which have led, to take the example of the Sahel \nregion, to a decrease in rainfall and reduced water \nflows, with the silting up of waterways, as in the case of \nthe Niger River; the drying up of Lake Chad, which has \nlost 90 per cent of its area in 50 years, shrinking from \n25,000 square kilometres to 2,500; extreme flooding \nand drought; reduced plant cover, including forest loss; \nreduced biodiversity; reduced crop yields; and thus the \nimpoverishment of the population, whose young people \nthen become an easy target for recruitment by terrorists \nand organized crime.\n\nHowever, since the United Nations Climate Change \nConference in Copenhagen, we have seen not a decrease \n\n\nbut an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. If nothing \nis done, the temperature increase may surpass 2 degrees \ncentigrade in 20 to 30 years and reach 4 degrees by the \nend of the century. We must therefore regroup and focus \non promoting clean energy, such as hydro-electricity, \nnuclear energy and solar energy, provided that, in the \nlatter case, we create competitive conditions for it. We \nalso need to promote what is called smart agriculture \nand make adjustments in the industrial, transport and \nconstruction sectors.\n\nI hope that humanity will not squander the \nopportunity that will be provided in Paris. I hope that \nwe will implement a development model that will \nenable us to save our planet. I hope that we will be able \nto build a more just and humane world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my great honour \nto represent Ireland today at the General Assembly. \nRegrettably, this gathering comes at a dangerous time in \nglobal history. Delegates here represent a world facing \nmany challenges, but they are challenges that can be \ntackled with unity of purpose and surmounted through \nstrong leadership, especially from this Organization, \nthe United Nations. Indeed, the United Nations must be \nat the vanguard of efforts to eradicate terrorism where \nit flourishes, to preserve the sovereignty of States \nwhere it is threatened and to promote and protect peace \nand human rights where those essential components of \nhuman dignity and human happiness are lacking.\n\nIn my address this afternoon, I will focus on \nthe conflicts that beset the Middle East and Eastern \nEurope, and I will do so in a way that reflects the \nforeign policy tenets of my country: first, dialogue \nand compromise as the solution to intractable conflicts \nbetween peoples; secondly, respect for the rule of law \nand solidarity within the international community \nwhen a democratic State is threatened; thirdly, a strong \ncommitment to peacekeeping while preserving Irish \nmilitary neutrality; fourthly, the critical importance of \ndevelopment; and last but not least, the promotion of \nhuman rights, in particular the rights of minorities and \nof women and girls in this troubled world.\n\nI will begin by outlining some thoughts on the \nimportance of reform of the United Nations and its \nSecurity Council. We see a world beset by warfare \nand terror on many fronts. Heart-rending reports of \nescalating casualty and refugee numbers, the slaughter \nof innocents, the suffering of children and vulnerable \nadults in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, Ukraine and many other \nconflicts dominate the news on our airwaves and \ntelevision news and on the Internet. The people we \nrepresent in the Assembly rightly expect the United \nNations to be a source of action. Regrettably, too \noften, they see an institution that seems hamstrung and \nstymied in situations where it needs to be both decisive \nand strong.\n\nIt is not that we lack the necessary instruments; the \nmany achievements of this great Organization amply \ndemonstrate its capacity to act decisively and effectively \nwhen the necessary political will is forthcoming. For \nthe United Nations to meet the manifold, complex \nand grave challenges that are dominating this year\u2019s \nsession of the Assembly, the Organization must review \nits working methods and priorities. Resources must be \ndirected to the areas of greatest need and used with the \nutmost efficiency.\n\nIn particular, we must see new approaches to the \nwork of the Security Council \u2014 something Ireland \nand its partners in the Accountability, Coherence and \nTransparency Group have been actively promoting. \nWhile Ireland would like to see the veto power in the \nCouncil ultimately abolished, we strongly welcome \nthe initiative of France, supported by Mexico, to \nbetter regulate the use of that power by the Council\u2019s \npermanent members. Moreover, Ireland supports an \nincrease in the membership of the Security Council to \nmore closely reflect regional balances as well as the \ncurrent realities of population and economic weight in \nthe world.\n\nThe challenge of achieving peace in the Middle East \nremains as great as ever. As Member States, we must do \nmore to assist the United Nations in its vital life-saving \nefforts in Syria and the many other humanitarian \nchallenges confronting the broader region. I want to \npay particular tribute here to the heroic role of the \nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \nRefugees in the Near East and its brave and dedicated \nstaff in Gaza, 11 of whom tragically lost their lives \nduring the recent horrific conflict. We are all indebted \nto Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl and his colleagues for providing \nan indispensable lifeline to the people of Gaza over \nmany years.\n\nOur goal must be to ensure that there is no return to \nthe recurrent cycles of violence that we have witnessed \nin Gaza and southern Israel on three occasions now, \nmost devastatingly during July and August. Each cycle \nof violence appears to harden attitudes on both sides of \nthe conflict, and yet, ultimately, no one can want peace \nmore than those most directly affected by its absence.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that the achievement of \na lasting peace requires that the underlying issues that \ngave rise to the most recent bout of violence must be \ndefinitively addressed. The closures and restrictions \nthat have applied to Gaza for seven long years now must \nbe brought to an end. Equally, there must be assurances \nfor all Israelis and Palestinians that they will not \nbe subjected to indiscriminate violence, whether \nthat violence comes in the form of rocket attacks \ntargeting Israel or retaliatory strikes with devastating \nconsequences for Gaza and its people.\n\nIt is also now long past time for the attainment \nof a comprehensive peace between the Israeli and \nPalestinian peoples. None of us is under any illusions \nabout the difficult and painful compromises that will \nbe involved. In essence, however, I believe that most \nIsraelis and Palestinians recognize that the only true \nbasis for peace and security between them lies in the \nrealization of a just, negotiated two-State solution. It \nremains vital that all actions or policies that impede \nthat prospect be avoided.\n\nWhile there is at least a clear vision of the difficult \ncompromises necessary to achieve a lasting peace \nbetween the peoples of Israel and Palestine, the situation \nin neighbouring Syria appears at the moment to present \nan even greater challenge. Over the past three and a \nhalf years, almost 200,000 people have lost their lives \nat the hands of the State and militant groups in that \nvicious conflict. Ultimately, the solution to Syria\u2019s \ncivil war is not a military one. I strenuously urge all in \nthe international community to fully support Special \nEnvoy De Mistura in his efforts to promote a political \nsettlement based on the principles of the Geneva \ncommuniqu\u00e9 of 30 June 2012. The flagrant violation of \ninternational law by all sides in the Syrian conflict must \nbe confronted and referred to the International Criminal \nCourt. All sides, particularly the Al-Assad regime, must \ncomply with their obligations under Security Council \nresolutions 2165 (2014) and 2139 (2014), and put an \nend to their obstruction of vital humanitarian efforts \nand to obscenities such as besieging communities and \nattempting to starve them into submission.\n\nThe growth of the extremism we are now witnessing \nacross the region is a cause for significant concern and \none that I know is shared by everyone in the Assembly. \nThe bloodlust and inhumanity that the Islamic State in \nIraq and the Sham (ISIS) is displaying in those countries \nhas shocked and appalled all civilized people. The \ndestruction and displacement of the ancient Christian \ncommunities of northern Iraq has been harrowing to \nwitness. The gratuitous and almost casual approach \nto that most gruesome form of murder, beheading; the \nbarbaric sexual violence perpetrated against women and \ngirls; the base corruptness of putting military weapons \nin the hands of children; the scapegoating of people \nbased on their ethnicity or religion, whether Christian, \nYazidi, Kurdish, Sunni, Shia or Jewish \u2014 all of that, \ntaken together, harks back to a mentality and a culture \nwe thought had long been consigned to the dustbin of \nhistory. The rise of ISIS, the continued activities of \nAl-Qaida and the growing strength of Boko Haram \nmake it clear that there is no room for complacency \nin the international community when it comes to the \ngrowth of extremism. We must unite and mobilize to \nconfront this threat, and we must do so with a real sense \nof urgency.\n\nUkraine is the most dangerous political crisis to \noccur in Europe for several decades. The situation \nthere has profound implications for the viability and \nfuture of an international system that upholds the rule \nof law. The actions of the Russian Federation, first in \nCrimea and then in eastern Ukraine, clearly contravene \na wide range of international agreements. We should \nremember first and foremost the deplorable violence \nthat has been inflicted on innocent civilians in Ukraine \nover many months and the serious humanitarian crisis \nthat has ensued. There can be no military solution to \nthis crisis. We firmly support the path of diplomatic \ndialogue and welcome President Poroshenko\u2019s peace \nplan. We were encouraged by the Minsk agreement \nreached earlier this month within the framework of \nthe Trilateral Contact Group. A sustainable political \nsolution must be based on the principle of respect for \nUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and with clear guarantees on \nborder security, the disarmament of all illegal groups \nand the withdrawal of foreign forces.\n\nIreland has a proud tradition of involvement in \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions all over the \nworld, beginning in 1958. Our troops have made an \nimportant contribution to international peace and \nstability; 82 of them have made the ultimate sacrifice. I \ntake this opportunity to recall and salute all those who \nhave fallen in United Nations peacekeeping operations \nsince we met for the general debate a year ago. Today, \nsome 370 Irish men and women are serving on United \nNations peacekeeping missions, the majority in the \nMiddle East. The environment in which they serve \nhas become increasingly complex and challenging. As \nit is for the Department for Peacekeeping Operations, \nthe safety and security of our personnel is a very high \npriority for us, and I warmly welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s announcement that there will be a review of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping. That should ensure that \nthe Organization retains the capacity to promote peace \nand stability internationally.\n\nThe Assembly can rest assured that Irish men \nand women will continue to wear the blue beret with \npride in service of the United Nations and in pursuit \nof a better world. Last week, at the high-level meeting \non peacekeeping hosted by the Secretary-General and \n\nVice-President Biden of the United States, I was pleased \nto announce an initiative by my Government to deliver \na new programme for training African peacekeepers \nthat will include a specific focus on areas such as the \nprotection of civilians, gender sensitivity, human rights, \nleadership training and logistics.\n\nThe full and equal participation of women is \nanother essential component in building peaceful, \nstable societies. Women are key agents of change \nand must be full protagonists in our ongoing global \nstory. Political will is a crucial element in driving \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and gender equality going \nforward. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) was \na milestone in recognizing that reality, and subsequent \nresolutions, most recently resolution 2122 (2013), \ndemonstrate our resolve to pursue the goal of women\u2019s \nfull and empowered participation in the political \nprocess. The current agenda of the United Nations \nincludes a welcome and necessary increase in the focus \non tackling the scourge of sexual violence in armed \nconflict. \n\nBut we must translate our global commitment into \nconcrete action. Achieving real gender equality requires \na commitment from all of us here, men and women. It \nis a commitment that Ireland is proud to have made, \nand next January we launch our second national action \nplan on women, peace and security. It is just part of our \nongoing commitment to ensuring that women and girls \ncan reach their full potential, live a life free from fear \nand fully take their place at the decision-making table.\n\nThe global threat posed by the spread of Ebola in \nWest Africa is a reminder that not all the challenges we \nface are man-made. Ireland is active in addressing this \nepidemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Security Council \nresolution 2177 (2014), sponsored by 130 Member \nStates, indicates the seriousness with which the world \nregards the problem and the need for urgent action on \nthe part of the United Nations.\n\nNext year, 2015, will be a critical one in the \nfight to end extreme poverty and hunger. We have \n15 months to maximize progress under the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and a mere 12 in which to negotiate \na new framework for international development. That \nframework must mark an important shift to sustainable \ndevelopment, with clear and ambitious targets that can \nhelp to end extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition in \na single generation. Ireland continues to play its part at \nthe United Nations and with our partners on the ground. \nWe have focused sharply on the continuing scandals of \nhunger, child stunting and maternal mortality in a world \nof plenty. I am pleased that last week the Human Rights \nCouncil adopted a draft resolution, led by Ireland, on \nthe preventable mortality and morbidity of children \nunder 5. It is indeed deplorable that some 6.6 million \nchildren under the age of 5 die annually, mainly from \npreventable and treatable causes.\n\nIreland is working with its partners in Africa on \nthe devastating impact of climate change, especially \non smallholder agriculture. Last week we joined the \nAlliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. On Thursday, I \nco-hosted a meeting here at the United Nations in support \nof the Secretary-General\u2019s Zero Hunger Challenge. \nAnd days earlier, in Dublin, UNICEF Ireland brought \nto me the voices of Ireland\u2019s young people, calling on \nus to strengthen our efforts and reminding me, in their \nwords, that \u201cIt\u2019s about us\u201d. Ireland\u2019s commitment to \na more equal, inclusive and sustainable future for the \nworld\u2019s children is demonstrated in practice through \nour development programme and our work with our \npartners in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the extremely \ndifficult economic circumstances of recent years, we \nare proud that we have stabilized funding for our aid \nprogramme. The fight to end poverty and hunger will \nremain a central tenet of our foreign policy.\n\nRecent events worldwide have demonstrated that \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms continue to \nbe violated and threatened, particularly in times of \nconflict. In many parts of the world today, brave women \nand men seek to highlight and address abuses of human \nrights, and to stand up for those who are oppressed or \nwithout a voice. I salute the courage of those human \nrights defenders and pledge that we in Ireland will \ncontinue to work for decisive action, whether in the \nUnited Nations or the European Union, in order to \nsupport them. As a member of the Human Rights \nCouncil, Ireland has sought to highlight the important \ncontribution of civil society to advancing human rights \nand building democratic societies.\n\nLast week, the Council adopted by consensus \nthe significant resolution 2178 (2014), led by Ireland, \ncalling on States to create and maintain a safe and \nenabling environment in which civil society can \noperate. We strongly condemn all forms of persecution \nand discrimination based on religion or belief. The \npersecution of Christians and other minorities in the \nMiddle East, and the recent rise of anti-Semitic attacks, \nparticularly in a number of European countries, are \ncauses of grave concern for me. Too often throughout \n\n\nhistory, the world has looked the other way when \nvulnerable minorities were being targeted, often as a \nprelude to a more serious conflict.\n\nOn a more positive note, as a former Minister for \nChildren and Youth Affairs in Ireland, I felt particularly \nhonoured last week to ratify the third Optional Protocol \nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child, reaffirming \nthe commitment of my Government to the protection \nand promotion of the rights of children in Ireland.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that at its most effective this \ngreat Organization, the United Nations, is a force for \ngood in the world and has much untapped potential. The \nundoubted achievements in areas, such as peacekeeping, \nconflict resolution, development and humanitarian \naction, to which Ireland is proud to contribute, should \nrenew our faith in our collective ability and inspire us \nto meet the challenges that confront us now and many \nof those that will lie ahead in the future.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI should like to extend my warmest congratulations \nto Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am \nconfident that under his able leadership this session \nwill enjoy great success. My appreciation also goes to \nMr. John William Ashe, President at the sixty-eighth \nsession, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for their \nimportant contributions to the work of our Organization \nover the past year.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place as \nwe approach the seventieth anniversary of the founding \nof the United Nations. It gives us the opportunity to \nlook back on the past almost 70 years of the United \nNations implementing its mandate to assist nations \nto build a world of peace, security and sustainable \ndevelopment, a world where fundamental rights and \nfreedoms are respected and promoted. It is also an \nopportunity for in-depth discussions on the formulation \nand implementation of the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nThis year\u2019s Assembly session is also convened \nagainst the backdrop of a world landscape that features \nnumerous turning points and contrasts. On the bright \nside, increasingly the United Nations is playing better \nits central role in the promotion of the system of \nrules and norms of international law, thus facilitating \nsolutions to global challenges, and of the interests of \npeace and development for all nations. Globalization \nand multilayered economic cooperation and linkages \ncontinue to evolve strongly. Our efforts to realize the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have brought \nencouraging results in most regions.\n\nWe see also a more sombre part, one that paints the \nmany daunting challenges the world is facing. The trend \nof cooperation contains risks, while global economic \nrecovery is yet to be sustainable. International peace \nand security are being challenged by the negative \nfactor of competition and intervention and especially \nby the potential escalation of territorial and sovereignty \ndisputes. Ongoing crises and conflicts in the Middle \nEast and a number of African countries have inflicted \nmajor human and material losses and threaten regional \nand international peace and security.\n\nGlobal challenges remain high on the agenda of the \ninternational community. Terrorism, the proliferation \n\nof weapons of mass destruction, nuclear security and \nsafety, environmental pollution, depletion of natural \nresources, climate change, natural calamities, epidemics \nand the lack of food and water security are issues of \nprimary concern to the international community. They \nrequire enhanced joint efforts.\n\nPeace and security are prerequisites for sustainable \ndevelopment. The United Nations and its Member \nStates must live up to their responsibility to strengthen \ninternational peace and security, prevent potential \nconflicts and find solutions to ongoing hostilities. \nThat is an urgent task, but it also requires long-term \nengagement. History has taught us that the paths that lead \nto wars and conflicts lie in obsolete doctrines of power \npolitics, of ambitions of domination and imposition, and \nof the threat of force in settling international disputes, \nincluding territorial and sovereignty disputes.\n\nViet Nam believes that respect for international \nlaw is the foundation of peace, security and stability \nfor sustainable development. More than ever, Member \nStates, big or small, rich or poor, must all respect and \nseriously observe the principles, rules and norms of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \nlaw. All nations must renounce the use of force as an \noption in their international relations and instead settle \nall disputes by peaceful means. That is a crucial area \nin which the United Nations represents a powerful \nadvance from the League of Nations, and it commands \ngreater commitment and effort from Member States.\n\nIn that spirit, Viet Nam looks forward to substantive \nprogress in the negotiations for a comprehensive, fair \nand long-term solution for peace in the Middle East that \nwill ensure the fundamental rights of the Palestinian \npeople and the legitimate interests of all parties. We are \ndeeply concerned about the escalating violence in Iraq. \nand we support the efforts of the Iraqi Government and \nthe international community to stabilize the situation. \nWe call for an end to unilateral economic sanctions \nagainst developing countries and support General \nAssembly resolutions on ending the economic embargo \nagainst Cuba.\n\nViet Nam strongly condemns all acts of terror in \nany form, especially the targeting of civilians. We \nsupport all international efforts and initiatives to \ncombat that menace in accordance with international \nlaw and the United Nations Charter. In addition, we all \nhave a stake in economic restructuring, job creation, \nachieving a balanced, inclusive and sustained growth, \nand in maintaining a peaceful and stable environment \nconducive to development.\n\nIt is therefore our primary task to complete the \nMDGs and formulate the post-2015 development agenda \nto create added momentum for sustainable development \nin each country and for international economic linkages. \nIn that process, the United Nations should focus more \nactions and resources on addressing social injustices \nand inequalities. It should provide stronger support to \nregional and subregional programmes for connectivity, \npoverty reduction, narrowing the development gap \nand building the green economy. That will lay a firm \nand long-term foundation for peace, security and \ndevelopment. In so doing, and to adapt itself to a \nconstantly changing world, the United Nations must \naccelerate its reform process in a comprehensive, \nbalanced, transparent and equal manner in the interests \nof all Member States. The Security Council must be \nreformed in both membership and working methods \nto better respond to global challenges to peace and \nsecurity.\n\nIn its national socioeconomic development and in its \ninternational integration, Viet Nam has always attached \nimportance to the roles of multilateral institutions \nand forums, especially that of the United Nations, in \nthe areas of international and regional security and \ndevelopment. Viet Nam is proud to be an active and \nresponsible member of important regional and global \norganizations, such as the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the Non-Aligned Movement, \nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asia-\nEurope Meeting. Viet Nam is doubling its efforts to \nachieve all MDGs and is actively participating in the \nformulation of the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nIt is our consistent, principled position to respect \nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and \nto settle international disputes and conflicts, including \nthe issue of the East Sea, or South China Sea, by \npeaceful means in accordance with international law, \nincluding the 1982 United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea. Viet Nam abides by the Declaration \non the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and \nworks to ensure an early adoption of the code of conduct \nfor parties in the South China Sea.\n\nWe support efforts to strengthen the multilateral \ntrade system to create fresh momentum for the world \neconomy in order to regain sustained growth. Viet Nam \nis willing to join global efforts to enhance economic \n\n\nlinkages and reform the global economic and trade \ngovernance towards greater equality, democracy, \ntransparency and efficiency.\n\nViet Nam and other ASEAN member States are \nworking hard to establish the ASEAN Community in \n2015 with three pillars: political-security cooperation, \neconomic cooperation and social-cultural cooperation. \nThat, we believe, will help to build a South-East Asian \nregion of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity \nand to form a regional architecture with ASEAN at the \ncentre, founded upon international law and aimed at \ndeveloping common rules and norms for the region.\n\nTo contribute to international efforts to enhance \nprinciples and norms for peace, sustainable \ndevelopment and human rights, Viet Nam is playing an \nactive and constructive role as a member of the Human \nRights Council. For the very first time, Viet Nam has \ndispatched its military officers to the United Nations \npeacekeeping mission in South Sudan. Looking \nforward, Viet Nam has presented its candidature for the \nEconomic and Social Council for the 2016-2018 term \nand for the Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. \nWe count on the valuable support of members.\n\nPeace and development are inseparable companions. \nThey complement each other on the path towards a \nprosperous world. We are confident that with political \nwill, mutual trust and equality based on international \nlaw and responsible joint actions, we can build stronger \npartnerships for peace, cooperation and sustainable \ndevelopment for all.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, \nPresident of Burundi, and the people of Burundi as a \nwhole, I would first like to offer warm congratulations \nto you, Sam Kutesa, a son of Africa, for your election \nby acclamation on 11 June as President of the General \nAssembly at its current session. I would also like to \nacknowledge the remarkable work of His Excellency \nMr. John Ashe, who presided over the Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session, which he closed in this newly \nrenovated Hall. And I take this opportunity to reiterate \nour gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor his untiring efforts to improve the functioning \nof the Organization and for the results attained in a \nparticularly difficult socioeconomic context.\n\nAt this important moment, when delegations from \nmany different parts of the globe have come together, \nwe would like to express our appreciation for the \ntheme of the sixty-ninth session, \u201cDelivering on and \nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \nagenda\u201d. It comes at just the right time, since we are \nslowly but surely and inexorably approaching the \ndeadline for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs).\n\nBeyond that, I would also like to welcome the \npriorities that you have already set, Mr. President, \nwhich focus on eradicating poverty and hunger and \npromoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \nAs the authors of the report of the high-level group \nestablished to make recommendations on the post-\n2015 development programme put it, the theme chosen \nand your priorities are simultaneously ambitious and \npragmatic. The report cites intense discussions in every \nregion and in many sectors, especially on those living \nin poverty. The same team fosters the hope that our \ngeneration will be able to produce the transformations \nneeded to end the poverty that is devastating people all \nover our planet.\n\nWe should therefore emphasize that however \nambitious the group\u2019s recommendations may be, they \nshould also take into account the realities on the ground \nand the fact that the transformative changes linked to \nthe goals and indicative targets \u2014 those coming out \nof discussions with 5,000 civil society organizations, \n250 leaders of major businesses and the scientific and \n\nacademic communities, along with national, regional \nand international consultations \u2014 can contribute \nto reducing hunger and poverty around the world by \ngenerating tangible economic growth that can be \nequitably shared in order to achieve the well-being we \nseek.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals were a pact of \nglobal socioeconomic solidarity for our countries. Like \nother nations in Africa and elsewhere, Burundi has \ngreat respect for those Goals. As the aforementioned \ngroup has rightly pointed out, the fastest reduction in \npoverty in the history of the world occurred during the \nfirst 13 years of the new millennium. The same group \nnotes that the number of people living on $1.25 a day \nhas fallen, and child mortality has declined by 30 per \ncent since the 2000 Millennium Declaration (resolution \n55/2), while deaths attributable to malaria have been \nreduced by one quarter.\n\nWhile we should note that not every country can \nboast the same progress, Burundi shares the belief that \nit would be wrong for us to abandon the MDGs and start \nover at zero. On the contrary, we should continue the \nreforms that have produced the unprecedented progress, \nwhich is unquestionably the result of improved policies \nand commitment on a global scale aimed at meeting the \nMillennium Development Goals. We should therefore \ncapitalize on them in order to profit further. We also \nsubscribe to the other declared priorities, including \nthe adoption of a post-2015 development agenda, the \nstrengthening of cooperation and reforming the United \nNations, as well as strengthening partnerships between \nthe United Nations and other bodies.\n\nAlthough at the moment it seems clear that Burundi \nwill not be able to fully meet the established Goals, I \nshould point out that we have made undeniable progress \nin the areas of education and health, thanks in particular \nto our programmes of free education and medical care \nfor children under five and new mothers. Besides the \n3,000 classrooms and many health centres built over the \npast few years, we have seen positive results in other \nsectors, too.\n\nIn the area of education, many young Burundians, \nincluding girls, who had no access to schooling in the \npast are now attending school. In the area of health care, \nwe have reduced child and maternal mortality, and we \nare working on stabilizing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS \nand meeting the eligibility requirements for the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We \ndelivered accounts of those efforts at the Assembly\u2019s \nsixty-eighth session, as well as of the reduction of \ndeaths due to malaria.\n\nOn the political front, as we indicated in our address \nto the Assembly at the sixty-eighth session, Burundi has \nbeen working on the process we committed to months \nago for holding presidential and general elections, \nscheduled to begin in May 2015. In that regard, it is \nimportant to note that after the holding of successive \nelections in 2005 and 2010, with support from the \nUnited Nations and other partners, the entire political \nclass, through the leaders of the authorized political \nparties and other parties, agreed in March 2013 on a \nroad map for the next elections.\n\nIn that regard, one must add that, thanks to \nthat extremely valuable instrument, which should \nhelp the Burundian political parties in the holding \nof transparent, free and democratic elections, the \nBurundian Parliament adopted the electoral code by \nconsensus. Subsequently, the Head of State promulgated \nit, as prescribed by our Constitution, which is the fruit \nof the Arusha Agreement of 2000, to which Burundi \nattaches great importance. Moreover, the electoral \ncalendar was announced last June by the Independent \nNational Electoral Commission, itself established after \nconsultations and agreement among the political parties \ninvolved in the matter.\n\nWe can therefore say that things are moving \nand progressing well in my country. I also wish to \nreaffirm loud and clear what the Head of State, His \nExcellency Pierre Nkurunziza, often reiterates, that \nthe 2015 elections will be held in better conditions than \nprevious elections and that success will be complete. \nThe Burundian people have suffered so much from the \nviolence that has plunged many families into mourning \nthat we cannot afford to relapse into the errors of the \npast. Indeed, we made the firm commitment to bury \nthe hatchet once and for all. That is why we have made \nour own the words of former Indian politician Mahatma \nGandhi: \u201cI object to violence because when it appears \nto do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does \nis permanent\u201d.\n\nWith regard to good governance, my delegation \nwould like to return to the institutions established \nduring the current legislature session. The tools for \nimproving good governance include the National \nIndependent Human Rights Commmission and the \ninstitution of the Ombudsman, whose performance is \ndeemed satisfactory by many of our compatriots. A \nnational strategy on good governance and on the fight \n\nagainst poverty for 2011-2015 has been adopted and is \nbeing implemented.\n\nOf course, we are far from achieving the expected \nresults, but in Burundi and elsewhere it is a long-\nterm undertaking. What is important is that there \nis the political will to always move forward and \nmeet the challenge of zero tolerance in this area \neventually. In addition, performance contracts have \nbeen signed by members of the Government and by the \nsenior Government officials in order to improve the \nfunctioning of our Administration. The establishment \nof the Burundi Revenue Authority has improved State \nrevenues and reduced corruption, which was also once a \ncommon practice in our tax administration and business \ncircles. Here too, one must point out that perfection is \nnot yet at hand, but there is the determination and the \nwill to resolve the scourge of corruption for good.\n\nAs for the Truth and Recon.iliation Commission \nenvisaged by the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation \nAccord, the relevant law has already been passed by \nParliament. Consultations are under way to elect its \n11 commissioners, on the understanding that the filing \nof nominations was closed in July 2014, and an ad hoc \ncommittee for the selection of candidates has just been \nset up by general consensus.\n\nConcerning the participation of women in political \nlife, we have strengthened the number of women in \nthe country\u2019s institutions, even going beyond the \nconstitutional provisions in that area. The Burundian \ndelegation provided the figures in its statement last \nyear.\n\nWith respect to the peacebuilding programme in \nBurundi, the coordination mechanisms, such as the \ncoordination group of partners, hold their meetings \nthrough appropriate structures, such as clusters, \nstrategic forums and policy forums. The same is true \nfor the coordination of assistance, for which Burundi \nadopted the same structures.\n\nThe mandate of the United Nations Office in \nBurundi will end on 31 December, and the Office will \ntransfer its responsibilities to a United Nations country \nteam in Burundi, preparations for which are in full \nswing. A joint transition programme was presented to \nthe appropriate body on 14 May in the United Nations \nOffice. Also, a joint steering committee and a technical \ntransition team were established and are functioning \naccording to their mandate.\n\nFinally, also in the context of peace consolidation, \na third phase of that programme, coverning the period \n2014 to 2016, will soon become operational. The themes \nof the programme have already been adopted by the \nrelevant authorities.\n\nOn the economic front, Burundi has held two \nsectoral conferences on priority areas, one in July \n2013 and the other in October. Their purpose was to \ndecide, together with bilateral partners, on ways and \nmeans to implement the commitments made by each \nat the conference of Burundi\u2019s development partners \nheld in Geneva in October 2012. The areas deemed \npriorities were drawn from two strategic instruments: \nthe Burundi Vision 2025 and the Strategic Framework \nfor Growth and the Fight against Corruption, Second \nGeneration.\n\nThe first instrument is for long-term development \nplanning and projects Burundi\u2019s image in 2025. It \nshould guide policies and strategies for sustainable \ndevelopment from the perspective of meeting the \nneeds of present generations without hampering \nor compromising future generations. The second \ninstrument \u2014 the Strategic Framework for Growth \nand the Fight against Poverty, Second Generation \u2014 is \nanchored in Vision 2025. It is the unifying framework \nfor all sectoral and multisectoral policies, breaking the \nstrategic pillars of the Vision Burundi 2025 down into \nprojects and programmes.\n\nThe results obtained in the economic sphere are \nrather mixed. That is why the Government would \nagain like to make an urgent appeal from this rostrum \nto the partners represented here that they honour the \ncommitments made at the Geneva conference of 2012.\n\nRegarding Burundi\u2019s post-2015 development \nprogramme, the following areas have been identified. \nThey are: governance, inequalities, conflicts and \nfragility; economic growth and employment; energy, \nwater and environmental sustainability; access to basic \nsocial services; and population dynamics and food \nsecurity. That agenda was the result of an extensive \nnational consultation that included all segments of the \npopulation. On its face, it can be seen to be a programme \nrooted in the continuity of change, well grounded in the \ntransformative development of the lives of our people \nand consistent with the theme for this session of the \nAssembly.\n\nEven if regional integration does not seem to be \nexplicitly laid out in the programme, I would like to \n\nconvey to all present that regional integration is a matter \nto which Burundi is firmly committed and which it \nconsiders to be a common thread linking the various \npolicy areas, with the potential to provide appropriate \nresponses to the challenges that our country faces.\n\nAt the international level, conflicts continue to \ntear a number of countries apart and to undermine \ndevelopment efforts in many others. We must mobilize \nour energies and work in synergy to end and eliminate \nsuch threats as terrorism, transnational organized \ncrime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and others. \nIn that regard, Burundi is striving, as much as possible, \nto do its part to help maintain peace and security in the \nworld.\n\nBurundi was one of two countries in Africa and \nthe world that decided to intervene in Somalia as part \nof the African Union Mission in 2008, and we continue \nto strive to contribute to the stabilization of that \ncountry to this day. In that regard, Burundi is proud \nof the progress made towards normalization in Somali, \nwhich promises a better future for Somalia. However, \nthe success achieved should not obscure the enormous \nchallenges still facing Somalia. Burundi is committed \nto working with the other partners to address them.\n\nBurundi has also participated in peacekeeping \noperations in other countries, including the Central \nAfrican Republic, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Haiti, the Sudan and \nSyria, to name but a few.\n\nWith regard to Mali, we are greatly satisfied that \nterritorial integrity has been restored in that country \nand that the presidential elections held there were a \nsuccess.\n\nRegarding the conflict in the Middle East, Burundi, \nlike other members of the international community, \nis deeply concerned about the deteriorating security \nsituation in the region observed in recent weeks. That is \nwhy we urge all parties to stop armed attacks, to avoid \nthe loss of human life and to seek negotiated settlements \nto their disputes.\n\nFinally, with regard to the Ebola crisis, we, like \nother African countries, are very concerned about \nthe rapid spread of the Ebola virus, as was vividly \ndescribed by many representatives during the Security \nCouncil meeting of 18 September (see S/PV.7268). \nWe congratulate the Council on its adoption on \n18 September of resolution 2177 (2014) on the Ebola \ncrisis, at the initiative of the United States of America. \nMy delegation is proud to have sponsored the resolution, \nalong with 134 other States, early in its development.\n\nWith regard to South Sudan, we urgently call on \nall parties to the conflict to break the cycle of violence \nand resolve their differences through political dialogue. \nIn that connection, we are pleased to announce that \nBurundi has promised an infantry battalion of 850 men \nto help that young State to restore peace and security.\n\nI also wish to inform the Assembly that Burundi \nhas made progress regarding the implementation \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in \ngeneral and in the areas of education and health in \nparticular. However, despite my country\u2019s efforts to \naccelerate actions to honour the commitments made \nat the Millennium Summit in 2000, the international \neconomic climate, and that in Burundi in particular, \nhas not been favourable for their attainment. The \nGovernment of Burundi remains committed, however, \nto the development goals programme and will continue \nto work beyond 2015 to redouble its efforts to safeguard \nand strengthen the principles and values contained in \nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), which \nis a solid foundation for the post-2015 development \nprogramme.\n"

        "file_text": "Without trying to be \nmelodramatic, I believe that my country, the Pacific \nregion and the world have reached a crossroads. In \nthis International Year of Small Island Developing \nStates, leading up to the climate change negotiations \nat the twentieth and twenty-first Conferences of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, the third International Conference \non Financing for Development and the impending \nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda, viewed \nwithin the context of our rising oceans, the Ebola crisis \nin Africa and the apparent societal inferno in progress \nin the Arab world, we find our societies, our cultures \nand our economies under serious attack, never before \nexperienced on so many fronts. We can continue \nbusiness as usual along our current course and wait for \nthe horizons to clear the global haze or we can choose a \ndifferent road, one that will give our critical habitats the \nchance to recover and thereby ensure their continued \nability to sustain us. Am I a foolish dreamer or a simple \npragmatist? I guess that only time will tell.\n\nHowever, I will say one thing. My country, small \nas it is, will not go down without a fight, using every \navailable tool, nor will the Pacific region, whose people \ncomprehend first-hand the real and current impacts \nof climate change and recognize that their oceans are \nbecoming polluted and their fish stocks depleted. That \nis why the Pacific leaders at this year\u2019s Pacific Islands \nForum supported the Palau Declaration under the \ntheme \u201cThe ocean: life and future\u201d. Within that theme \nand Declaration, the Pacific leaders highlighted the fact \nthat, in order to survive, we will have to continue to play \na central role in the stewardship of one of the greatest \nendowments of the world \u2014 the Pacific Ocean. That is \nbecause, in our short lifetime, we have experienced a \ndangerous combination of human impacts that threaten \nthe foundation of our Pacific livelihoods.\n\nThat is why we have called on the global community \nto support the efforts of the Forum countries to \nsustainably use their ocean resources and to conserve \ntheir valuable underwater heritage. That is why Palau, \nKiribati, the Cook Islands, New Caledonia, the United \nStates of America, the Federated States of Micronesia and \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands are currently in the \nprocess of declaring and establishing protected marine \nareas of different sizes and requirements to reverse \nthe current trends of overuse and overexploitation and \nthereby ensure a healthy ocean for our children.\n\nThat is why we are committed to ensuring the launch \nof negotiations by September 2015 for an international \nagreement under the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable \nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of \nnational jurisdiction. That is why we are calling upon \nthe United Nations to ensure a stand-alone sustainable \ndevelopment goal (SDG) on oceans.\n\nHowever, while we are strongly in favour of that \ncritical SDG, we are concerned that the post-2015 \ndevelopment dialogue may be too broad. We must \n\n\nremember that an agenda of everything is effectively \nan agenda of nothing. Above all, our goals and targets \nmust be realistic, practical, simple, transparent and \nmeasurable. In that context, we must continue to focus \non the vulnerable countries and the people most in need. \nTo accomplish that objective, we must recognize that \none size does not fit all and that we must continue to \nconcentrate on a common but differentiated response.\n\nOur international community has years of \nexperience of what does and does not work with our \nMillennium Development Goals. It is now time to \ncomplete the work on the remaining half and to continue \nto improve both the level and the responsiveness of our \nfinancing mechanisms. We must also ensure that the \nbulk of the financing reaches those that need it most \nand that their share is not a mere drop in the bucket.\n\nIn the Pacific, we believe action must begin \nin one\u2019s own backyard. In my country, in the next \nseveral months, we will formalize the establishment \nof a national marine sanctuary, which will include a \ncomplete prohibition on purse seine fishing that covers \n100 per cent of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), \na \u201cno-take\u201d marine sanctuary that covers 80 per cent \nof the Palau EEZ; a highly regulated fishing zone that \ncovers approximately 20 per cent of the EEZ and will \nprovide for Palau\u2019s domestic fishing needs alone; and a \nprohibition on commercial fish exports. Through our \nglobal actions and our partnerships between developing \nand developed nations and between the private and \nthe public sectors, we can achieve a transformational \nshift in the way we think about the use of our Earth\u2019s \nnatural assets. By recognizing the ocean as a joint and \nprimary asset of every citizen on our planet, we can \nmove towards the global management of our global \nocean exclusive economic zone.\n\n\nWe must never shift from the need for a global \nclimate change initiative that addresses the threat to \nall people of all nations. Climate change is our planet\u2019s \nsilent war. It must not remain on the back pages of our \nminds and our global commitments. We must move it \nto the front page, alongside global conflicts, so that it \nreceives the attention and the financing that it deserves. \nAnd we must understand that, in terms of public health, \nclimate change is a defining issue for our century.\n\nClimate change affects the air that we breathe, \nthe food that we eat, the water that we drink and \nthe infectious diseases that find their way into our \nhomes. Our world leaders, whether from developed or \ndeveloping countries, must overcome the failures of our \nown lost generation. As the Secretary-General said, the \nrace is on, and now is the time for leaders to step up and \nsteer the world towards a safer future. A temperature \nincrease of 3.6 degrees is simply not acceptable. If that \nis the best objective that our global leaders can agree \non, we may as well throw in the towel and stop having \nchildren, because there will be no future for them.\n\nBy the end of 2015, our global leaders must \nannounce a new direction with new and realistic \ncommitments and practical actions, supported by \na greatly enhanced financial commitment both to \nmitigation and to adaptation. Those commitments must \ninclude the ratification of the second amendment to \nthe Kyoto Protocol. Within our discussions, migration \nshould not be an option. As the young mother Kathy \nJetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall Islands put it so \nbeautifully on Tuesday, \u201cNo one is moving. No one is \nlosing their homeland. No one is becoming a climate \nchange refugee\u201d.\n\nOur small island nations, which are the first to \nfeel the impacts of climate change, the first to feel the \nimpacts of diminished marine resources and the first to \nwet our feet in sea-level rise, are ready and willing to \nlead. We do not call for action from developed nations \nthat we are not willing to take ourselves. Last year, my \ncountry committed, under the Majuro Declaration for \nClimate Leadership, to a 20 per cent contribution of \nrenewable energy to the energy mix and a 30 per cent \nreduction in energy consumption by 2020. We are well \non the way to achieving those goals.\n\nSince its independence, Palau has been blessed \nwith strong partnerships. For over 50 years, the United \nStates has provided its support and friendship. Without \nits support to Palau\u2019s transition, revenue independence \nand infrastructure development, we would not be where \nwe are today. Palau stands strongly behind the United \nStates in its ongoing efforts to guide the international \nresponse to the horrific situation in Syria and Iraq \nand its actions to respond to the threat of the Islamic \nState in Iraq and Sham. Let us not forget that global \npeace and stability are critical if we are to achieve \nour development agenda and respond to the issues of \nclimate change and ocean regeneration.\n\nWe wish to give special thanks for President \nObama\u2019s support for oceans and the expressed intent \nto set aside 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine \n\n\nprotected areas. Finally, we thank the United States for \npast and future technical and financial assistance in our \nefforts to implement our National Marine Sanctuary. \nWe continue to look forward to finally completing our \nCompact of Free Association agreement, which reflects \nthis close and special relationship.\n\nPalau would also like to acknowledge the very \nsignificant economic support that we have received \nover the years from our good friend, Japan. We are \nhopeful that the Security Council expansion and reform \nprocess will result in Japan\u2019s permanent membership \non the Security Council. We also are hopeful that Japan \nwill continue to support and enhance public and private \nassistance to our exclusive economic zone surveillance \nefforts and our continued efforts to develop our National \nMarine Sanctuary.\n\nIn addition, Palau would like to thank the Republic \nof China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic \nsupport in assisting Palau to achieve our Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and would urge the United Nations \nsystem to involve Taiwan in the process of developing \nand implementing the post-2015 development agenda. \nI would also call upon the United Nations to support \nTaiwan\u2019s broader participation in the United Nations \nspecialized agencies and regional economic integration \nmechanisms, as its participation in the World \nHealth Assembly, the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement \nand the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \nwould demonstrate its ability to contribute to global \nand regional initiatives.\n\nWe also would like to express our thanks to the \nAustralian Government for its ongoing partnership, \nits annual aid assistance focused on education and \nits commitment to providing $2 billion to the Pacific \nregion to replace its aging marine surveillance fleet.\n\nFinally, we would like to recognize the very broad \nlist of partners around the globe that make our efforts \nto ensure a sustainable future possible, including New \nZealand, the European Union, private organizations, \nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. \nPartnerships such as those are commitments. We would \nnot be where we are today without them. In the post-\n2015 development environment, we must all recognize \nthat our actions as individuals, States, nations and \nregions have an impact on all our partners on planet \nEarth. If we are to save our oceans and if we are to stem \nthe tide of greenhouse gases, we must establish a long-\nlasting system of global partnerships and respect.\n\nAt the end of the day, we must recognize that some \nof us are developed and some of us are not. The means \nof implementation in terms of oceans, climate change, \nbiodiversity and all of the other issues that require global \nsolutions are therefore a recurring and central issue. \nWithout effective partnerships, change will simply not \noccur, and without legally binding commitments with \nrespect toour oceans and climate change, we will not \nmake the transformative changes that we need to make \nin the next generation.\n\nAs a small island developing State and a member of \nthe Pacific community, I am ready, willing and able to \ncommit to doing my share. I am even willing to lead. \nBut let us not fool ourselves. The only way to make a \ndifference in this modem global era is to go beyond our \nself-centred mentality. By standing together, we can \nindeed craft a sustainable future for our children and \nfor generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "I greet \nthe Assembly respectfully, and I hope that its sixty-\nninth session will provide favourable results for all \ncountries, peoples and humankind. I would like to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as the President \nof the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to thank \nMr. John William Ashe for his work as President at the \nsixty-eighth session.\n\nThe sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly \nis being held on the hundredth anniversary of the \nFirst World War, which broke out in 1914. We sadly \nsee that lands affected by the First World War are still \ndeprived of stability, peace and prosperity even after \na century. A wide area \u2014 ranging from Iraq to Syria, \nfrom Palestine to Yemen, from Libya to Afghanistan \nand to Ukraine \u2014 is witnessing scenes that leave deep \nscars on the conscience of humankind. People still \ndie from hunger and communicable diseases in the \ntwenty-first century. Children and women are brutally \nmurdered in wars. The poor countries struggle with \nhunger, malnutrition, communicable diseases and lack \nof education, while the rich countries of the world \nenjoy prosperity. Climate change poses a major threat \nto the future of our world and that of our children. That \nsituation, which is a stain on human dignity, directly \nconcerns all of humankind and therefore, of course, the \nUnited Nations.\n\nLet me again, at this sixty-ninth session, stress \nthat no one is innocent in a world in which children are \nkilled, no one is safe, and no one can enjoy peace and \nprosperity. In the past year alone, 6.3 million children \nunder five years of age lost their lives worldwide. As \na result of the war in Syria, 17,000 children have died, \n375,000 have been injured, and 19,000 have lost at least \none body part.\n\nThis year 490 children were killed and 3,000 \nwere injured as direct targets of the most modern \nand murderous weapons used against the Gaza Strip \nin Palestine. As they played on a beach, ran around \nin a park, took refuge in a mosque or school, or were \ncomforted in their mothers\u2019 laps, they were mercilessly \nkilled in front of cameras and before the eyes of the \nworld. We also see that those attempting to draw the \nworld\u2019s attention to the deaths of women, children and \nthe disabled in Palestine are being variously labelled by \nothers. Those objecting to the murders in Iraq and Syria \nand the murder of democracy in Egypt are again being \nsubjected to certain unfair and groundless accusations \nand almost immediately accused of supporting \nterrorism.\n\nThe global conscience is aware that those who \nare ruthlessly criticizing some countries for lack of \nfreedom of the press are ignoring the 16 journalists \nkilled in Palestine and the pressure put on members of \nthe media. I will speak very clearly. Those who stand \nby and remain unresponsive to the killing of children, \n\n\nthe vicious murder of women and the overthrow with \nweapons and tanks of Governments that have come \nto power through the will of the people are openly \nparticipating in those crimes against humanity.\n\nEven more significant, the modern world\u2019s double \nstandard leads to substantial and serious distrust \namong many people. That feeling of distrust affects \nthe United Nations \u2014 where we are today \u2014 and other \ninternational organizations and threatens the sense of \njustice, while filling millions of people with despair. \nThat distrust plays a principal role in fuelling the growth \nof international terrorism today. The double standard \nwith regard to the oppressed and the indifference to the \nkilling of children help to foment terrorism around the \nworld. Those who lose hope in the United Nations and \nother international organizations are desperate and are \nhelpless to resist the clutches of terrorists.\n\nThe problems in Iraq have wrought havoc among \nthe Iraqi people. More recently, the difficulties have \nspread beyond Iraq\u2019s borders. Unfortunately, Iraq has \nnow become a haven for terrorist organizations. The \ncurrent crisis in Iraq directly affects the countries in the \nregion, particularly Turkey. Given the newly established \nGovernment in Iraq, it is our hope that Iraq will make \na fresh start. Turkey will stand by the Iraqi people in \ntheir search for peace and stability. Likewise, the Syrian \ncrisis is spilling over the borders of that country. The \nunresolved issue of half a century \u2014 Palestine \u2014 is \nalready a root cause of many problems in the region.\n\nImplementing a two-State solution, lifting the \nblockade against Gaza and establishing an independent, \nviable State of Palestine alongside Israel is a political, \nhuman and moral necessity. Many have spoken about \na two-State solution from this rostrum. However, \nspeaking about it is not sufficient. It is high time to \nact. It is no longer appropriate simply to talk about the \nissue \u2014 we must advance beyond that. Thousands of \npeople are dying while we talk instead of acting. I think, \nat this point, it is a sad indication of the limits of our \nsense of responsibility here at the United Nations. We \nmust therefore move forward. We must address these \nproblems at the United Nations without any further \ndelay in order to prevent more deaths of innocent people \nand arrive at a solution.\n\nLet me also say that the world is larger than the five \npermanent members of the Security Council. The fact \nthat they have rendered the United Nations ineffective, \ndespite the situation in the world, must not be accepted \nby the global conscience. Otherwise, decisions taken \nat the United Nations will depend on a single country. \nThat is, if one country disagrees, then a decision will not \nbe taken or implemented. The United Nations failed to \nfind a solution as more than 2,000 innocent people were \nkilled within only two months in Palestine. In Syria, \nthe United Nations failed to find effective solutions as \nmore than 200,000 people were killed and more than \n9 million people were displaced in the past four years.\n\nI find it strange that we focus on issues selectively. \nIf 2,000 people are killed by chemical weapons, then \nwe focus on chemical weapons, and we consider the \nkilling of 2,000 people by chemical weapons to be a \ncrime. But what about the killing of 200,000 people by \nconventional weapons \u2014 is that not a crime? I cannot \nunderstand such an approach or such a mentality. Let us \nclarify our thinking. Let it be understood that the use \nof any kind of weapon leading to the deaths of people \nis a crime, whether by chemical or conventional means.\n\nThe elected President in Egypt was overthrown \nby a coup. Thousands of people wanted to defend \ntheir electoral choice and were killed. Yet, the United \nNations and democratic countries have done nothing \nbut stand by while those events unfolded and the person \nwho conducted the coup was legitimized. If we wish \nto speak meaningfully of democracy, then we should \nrespect the choice of the people at the ballot box. If, on \nthe other hand, we intend to defend people who come \nto power via a coup, then I must call into question the \nwhole existence of the United Nations.\n\nThe United Nations is also unable to take an \neffective stance in the face of uncontrolled events, \nsuch as terrorism and migration in Iraq. This \nsilence, desperation and unresponsiveness can no \nlonger continue. We need more efficient and speedy \ndecision-making mechanisms if we are to be able to \naddress global and regional problems. Furthermore, \nthe United Nations should act more courageously in \nstanding up for the right side of the issues.\n\nLet me point out another problem. We do not \napprove of any kind of terrorism that is supposedly \ncarried out in the name of religion, and we believe that \nsuch acts are hugely disrespectful to all religions. We \nstrongly condemn tying Islam, which means peace, to \nterrorism. It is highly offensive that Islam and terror \nare spoken of together. Similarly, those who call their \ninhuman acts Islamic are offending the religion of \nIslam, every other religion, and humankind generally.\n\n\nTurkey has been trying very hard to build peace \nand prosperity in the region. We do not interfere in the \ninternal affairs of any country; we respect and support \nthe territorial integrity of every country in the region. \nRegarding the question of Palestine and Israel, we have \nbeen working to try to achieve a two-State solution \nbased on peace and mutual respect. Our sensitivity to \nthis issue is based on the principle that the right to live \nof every human being is sacred.\n\nWe have approached the problems in our region \non humanitarian and moral grounds alone, heedless \nof race, religion, sect or interests. Our country is \nsheltering 1.5 million people who have had to leave \nSyria, and mostly from our own resources. Let me \nrepeat, 1.5 million refugees are in my country. As the \nhost country, we are providing them with food, medicine \nand education. As for support from the rest of the world, \nthere has not been much, unfortunately. So far we have \nspent more than $3.5 billion on the Syrian refugees in \nour country. Of the roughly 4 million Syrian refugees \nin the world, 1.5 million are in Turkey, with the rest \nin Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and other countries. \nBy contrast, I would like to ask what the strong and \nrich countries of Europe are doing. So far they have \nsheltered only 130,000 Syrian refugees \u2014 130,00 in all \nof Europe, while in Turkey alone we have 1.5 million, \nplus the 2.5 million in the other countries I just \nmentioned.\n\nThe crisis in Syria has become a regional and \nglobal issue, so much so that it is impossible to remain \nindifferent to it, whether for political or humanitarian \nreasons. On top of this, we have treated 102 injured \ncivilians from Gaza in our hospitals. Turkey has also \ntaken in 30,000 Yazidis fleeing Iraq, and, just before \nI came to New York, we opened our borders to Kurds \nfleeing Syria. It was Turkey who gave them humanitarian \naid. In the past five days alone, the number of Syrian \nrefugees entering our country exceeded 150,000.\n\nFive hundred years ago, we opened our doors to \nJews who had been expelled from Europe. We have \nalways protected the rights of Christians in Europe, and \ntoday we are still opening our arms to those in need, \nregardless of their religion, race or sect. I am proud \nto say that Turkey allocates 2.1 per cent of its national \nincome to humanitarian aid, and as such has become \none of the most generous countries in the world. In \naddition, thanks to the experience we have gained \nthroughout history, we have always maintained our \nobjectivity regarding terrorism, sectarian conflicts and \nother crises, and we have always based our approach on \nthe defence and protection of people\u2019s rights.\n\nI would like to point out here that Turkey is not \na country that supports or condones terrorism. We \nhave fought terrorism, because we suffered from it \nfor 30 years, and are still suffering from it. Turkey \nis also strongly against every kind of anti-Semitism, \nIslamophobia and racism. I have said myself that \nanti-Semitism is a crime against humanity, and I may \nbe one of the few political leaders who has so clearly \nexpressed this to the world. Similarly, the whole world \nshould accept that Islamophobia is also a crime against \nhumanity.\n\nTurkey would like to see a solution to the problem in \nCyprus. We would like to see an end to the occupation \nof territories in Azerbaijan. We have always voiced our \nstrong support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. \nWe stand ready to support regional and global peace \nat all costs, and we will continue to be a unique friend \nto our friends. We will always stand firm against \nterrorists, oppressors and killers, especially the killers \nof children. We will fight for democracy and prosperity \nwith all our heart and soul. We are always ready to \njoin forces with other countries within the framework \nof those ideals and on this common path, and that, of \ncourse, is the kind of cooperation that humankind is \nseeking today.\n\nIn that context, I should also say that we look to the \nGeneral Assembly to support Turkey in its candidacy \nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, and \nwe thank the countries that are backing us. To that end, \nI hope that the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly will \nbegin the work of wiping away the tears, blood, poverty \nand injustice staining the face of the Earth. I wish the \nAssembly and its President, Mr. Kutesa, every success, \nand I would like to convey my country\u2019s sincerest \ngreetings to all the nations represented here.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate \nMr. Sam Kutesa on his election to lead the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. I wish to thank him \nand the outgoing President, Mr. John Ashe, for their \nleadership. I must also commend Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon, who has more than measured up to the \ntremendous tasks associated with his high Office.\n\nAllow me to extend my sympathies to the families \nof the victims of the tragic and appalling events that \nhave recently unfolded around the world, from the \npassengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 to the \nrecent beheadings by the Islamic State of Iraq and \nSyria, to the victims of the Ebola epidemic and natural \ndisasters. We will never forget those tragedies and the \nloss of lives.\n\nI am humbled to speak in this hallowed Hall for the \nlast time as President of my island nation, the Federated \nStates of Micronesia. Like my predecessors, I come \nwith great respect for this honourable institution. This \nglobal Organization is best suited to address and solve \nthe pressing issues of our global family.\n\nI have come to the United Nations compelled \nby the dictates of conscience. We are all stewards of \nGod\u2019s creation here on Earth. The bounties of Mother \nNature are priceless, and we all bear the obligation to \nsustainably manage them.\n\nOver 30 years ago, small island countries brought \nthe issue of climate change to the attention of the \nUnited Nations. Some Members have criticized us for \nfocusing too much on climate change and sea-level rise, \nbut those issues influence our every decision and affect \nevery aspect of life in our islands. Across the globe, the \ndeadly impacts of climate change on the environment \nare stark realities. Others can afford to speak of them \nas future threats, but we in small island countries \nare already facing the impacts, which are worse than \nscience predicted.\n\nMicronesia means \u201clittle islands\u201d, with atolls rising \nonly a few feet above sea level. According to the Fifth \nAssessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change, human-caused climate change \nis leading to sea-level rise, more frequent and more \nintense typhoons and severe droughts. A small increase \nin the sea level would be a catastrophe for the atolls \nof Micronesia. Our islands contribute almost nothing \ntowards the causes of climate change, and yet we \nface the brunt of its adverse impacts. Climate change \nthreatens our food and water security, the health of our \npopulation, the health of our oceans and coral reefs, \nour biodiversity and the very existence of our island \nnations.\n\nWhat are we doing about it? Collectively, in order \nfor small islands to survive, the Alliance of Small \nIsland States (AOSIS) advocates for limiting global \nwarming to well below a 1.5\u00b0C increase above the \npre-industrial temperature. That requires immediate \naction from all stakeholders. Small Island Developing \nStates (SIDS) must not be asked to fight climate change \nby themselves. On that note, we support the recently \nlaunched World Bank initiative on carbon pricing.\n\nNext year, the twenty-first session of the Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (COP21), to be held \nin Paris, will establish a new climate change treaty, \nwhich will go into effect in 2020. However, the United \nNations Environment Programme has identified a pre-\n2020 emissions gap. Therefore, AOSIS has also made \n\n\nan important proposal to the work plan on enhancing \nmitigation ambitions in order to close the gap.\n\nMicronesia has made an equally important proposal \nto amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down the \nproduction and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons \n(HFCs), which are powerful greenhouse gases. That \naction can reduce the global average temperature \nincrease by up to 0.5\u00b0C by the end of this century. \nReducing HFCs and other short-lived climate pollutants \ncan reduce the rate of sea-level rise by 25 per cent. \nNear-term climate mitigation will give all atolls around \nthe globe a chance to survive.\n\nThe Montreal Protocol\u2019s success and enormous \npotential to protect the climate was recognized in The \nEconomist this week. The magazine has a separate \neditorial entitled \u201cParis via Montreal: The quickest \nway to cut greenhouse gases is to expand the Montreal \nProtocol\u201d. Indeed, the success of the Montreal Protocol \nin the next six months is our ticket to a successful \noutcome in Paris at COP 21. I commend the United \nStates of America and China for continuing to work \nto fulfil their agreement to use the Montreal Protocol \nto reduce HFCs. I call on other world leaders to join \nMicronesia and adopt the proposed HFC amendment.\n\nIn the face of already occurring climate change \nimpacts, the best small island nations can do on the \nground is to try to anticipate and adapt to climate change \nand instil the best possible disaster risk reduction and \nresponse policies. Adaptation is therefore a priority \nin Micronesia\u2019s Climate Change Act, which was \nrecognized at the recent world summit of the Global \nLegislators Organization for a Balanced Environment. \nThe Act implements our nationwide integrated disaster \nrisk management and climate change policy. The goal of \nthe policy is two-fold: first, to achieve economic growth \nand self-reliance within a framework of sustainable \ndevelopment, and secondly, to minimize the risks \nassociated with all human-induced and natural hazards, \nincluding those associated with climate change.\n\nMicronesia has also developed an agriculture policy \nto address food and water security and strengthen \neconomic development. The policy also provides the \nbasis for action to revitalize sustainable agriculture, \nwhile recognizing the major role played by traditional \nfarming systems and the importance of climate-resilient \ncrops. Other key national actions of Micronesia and \nother SIDS are reflected in the Majuro Declaration for \nClimate Leadership and the Palau Declaration on \u201cThe \nOcean: Life and Future\u201d.\n\nIn this International Year of Small Island \nDeveloping States, the United Nations has convened \na number of important conferences whose outcomes \nmust be incorporated into the post-2015 development \nagenda. In that regard, I stress the critical importance \nof implementing the Small Island Developing \nStates Accelerated Modalities of Action \u2014 Samoa \nPathway \u2014 the purpose of which is to stimulate \nsustainable development in SIDS through durable and \ngenuine partnerships.\n\nWe note with appreciation the report by the \nChairs of the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and fully endorse the proposed \nsustainable development goals (SDGs). We rely on \nour development partners to assist us in undertaking \nthe actions identified in the Samoa Pathway and in \nfulfilling the SDGs in ways that are appropriate for our \npeoples and our cultures.\n\nClean energy and energy efficiency are two of the \nkey engines for advancing our sustainable and low-\ncarbon development. Therefore, our national energy \npolicy gives priority to energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy. By 2020, the share of renewable energy sources \nwill be at least 30 per cent of total energy production, \nwhile electricity efficiency will increase by 50 per cent. \nThat will require harnessing sunshine, which we have \nin abundance, as well as renewable wind and marine \nenergy resources. I call on our development partners \nto assist us in implementing our national energy \npolicy, including through the SIDS Renewable Energy \nInitiative.\n\nOur ocean and its resources are of paramount \nimportance, but they are threatened by climate change \nand ocean acidification, which damage coral reefs and \ncould alter the migration patterns of tuna, our most \ncommercially valuable resource. Foreign vessels, \nwhich enjoy unprecedented returns from harvesting \nour exclusive economic zone, need to help us maintain \nthe health, productivity and resilience of our ocean. \nMicronesia must also receive fair compensation for the \nvalue of its resources.\n\nAs part of a programme of sustainable use, we must \nreduce the amount of by-catch being discarded, bring \nit to shore and put it to good use. Illegal, unreported \nand unregulated fishing (IUU fishing) continues to \nthreaten our ocean resources and undermines our \neconomic sustainability. We all must abide by the rules. \nIUU fishing must be stopped.\n\n\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become \na leading cause of death in the Pacific. Therefore, \nPacific leaders have declared NCDs an epidemic. Such \ndiseases are lifestyle diseases, but they are compounded \nby climate change, which destroys our food crops \nand contaminates our water supplies. Tackling that \nmultisectoral issue requires broad cooperation and \nsupport.\n\nHuman trafficking is one of the most serious social \ndiseases of modern society. It robs individuals of their \ndignity, particularly women and children. Profiting \nfrom human misery is despicable. Micronesia supports \nthe eradication of trafficking in all its forms. Objective \nand transparent ratings of countries will help achieve \nthat goal.\n\nWe urge the establishment of the \u201cOne UN\u201d \napproach for the North Pacific. We are now benefiting \nfrom the United Nations Joint Presence in the region, \nbut we need to increase its efficiency at the country \nlevel. The One UN approach is timely as we position \nourselves to implement the Samoa Pathway and the \npost-2015 development agenda, and it will help us \naddress our national priorities.\n\nDespite the United Nations target of setting aside \n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official \ndevelopment assistance, most developed nations fall far \nshort of that goal. Small island developing States face \nunique challenges owing to our extreme vulnerabilities, \nincluding climate change. The need for financial and \ntechnical assistance from development partners is \ngreater than ever, especially for human resources \ndevelopment and the capacity-building of domestic \ninstitutions.\n\nInternationally agreed financial mechanisms such \nas the Green Climate Fund must be fully capitalized \nand sufficiently scaled up to support the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. We applaud Germany, France and \nsix other nations for pledging specific sums. We urge \nthose countries and the other major economic Powers \nthat are also the major polluters to deliver the funds.\n\nMy Government has liberalized its \ntelecommunications system, and the World Bank is \nproviding assistance in the form of grants for installing \na state-of-the-art fibre-optic system in my country. That \nmuch-needed infrastructure will spur economic and \nsocial development. We continue to look to the World \nBank, the International Telecommunication Union, \nthe Asian Development Bank and other development \npartners to help us accelerate implementation of that \nnew system and provide for cyber-security.\n\nThe reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \nA reformed Council should reflect the political realities \nof today. It would be inconceivable to have a reformed \nCouncil without permanent seats for Japan, Germany, \nBrazil and India, as well as representation for Africa.\n\nMicronesia is confident that the United Nations \ncan maintain international peace and security. It shines \nlike a bright beacon of hope for those suffering from \nthe ravages of war. Micronesia condemns senseless \nkillings, no matter where they occur. The Middle East \nis a specific trouble spot that deserves this body\u2019s \nattention. Peace can be achieved through mutual \nrespect and economic stability, not by using civilian \nlives as shields.\n\nMicronesia also looks to the United Nations to \neffectively address the global security threats posed by \nclimate change. Micronesia has taken an active role in \nthe international sustainable development and climate \nchange negotiation processes. We will continue seeking \nsolutions to those challenges, out of the conviction that \nit is our moral obligation to protect Mother Nature \nand her bounties. All countries must work together to \nprotect our children\u2019s future.\n"

        "file_text": "It \nis an honour to participate in the sixty-ninth session \nof the General Assembly of the United Nations by \nrepresenting the people and the Government of the \nDominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere \ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \nPresident at the current session. I wish to thank the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the honour \nbestowed on our country by inviting us to participate \nin the Education First initiative. As I hope that he \nwas able to note in his recent visit to our country, the \npriority that education is being given in the Dominican \nRepublic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes \nspringing up in our country. It is true that news of hope \nis especially valuable these days when it is not very \nabundant.\n\nGenerally speaking, the times we live in \nraise major challenges for the mission of the \nOrganization \u2014 preserving peace, encouraging \ndevelopment, making education and health the \nentitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are \nall aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in \nthe financial sector of developed countries quickly \nspread to all productive sectors and has affected the \nentire planet. The consequences of the economic shock \ncontinue to be felt and were translated into tens of \nmillions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep \ncuts in social benefits in our countries.\n\nThe welfare State, the instrument which produced \nsome of the greatest advances in development and \nsecurity in history, was jeopardized. Today, we live \nthe paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable \ngrowth and social justice becomes more fragile in \nthe countries of origin, while it is being reborn in \nemerging countries. While developed countries adopt \npolicies of austerity and structural adjustments, which \nare concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans, we \nsee how social programmes proliferate in different \ncorners of the planet, lifting millions out of poverty and \nmitigating inequality.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, we still have a long \nroad ahead of us, but we are taking firm steps in the \nfight against poverty and inequality. We are a small \ncountry but we do not lack ambition. We have made \nthe commitment to our people, our citizens, to put \nthem at the centre of our public policy. And we have \nset ourselves the goal to become a developed and \nprosperous country, where equal opportunities will be, \nnot an ideal, but an everyday reality.\n\nTo achieve this, we have established a major \ndomestic compact, which will be our top priority as a \nnation: namely, education. That is why we have doubled \nthe current budget for public education and allocated \n\n\nto it 4 per cent of our gross domestic product. This \nwill enable us to carry out the largest expansion of \nschool infrastructure ever in our history and ensure \nthat all girls and boys, without exception, will have \naccess to quality public education. I am also proud to \ntell the Assembly that at the end of this year, thanks to \nthe efforts of thousands of volunteers, we will be in a \nposition to declare our country free of illiteracy.\n\nIn health, that second pillar essential to the welfare \nState, we are also making significant progress. We \nhave eliminated the co-payment for all public hospitals. \nEvery year, we add 450,000 participants to the \nsubsidized health insurance system.\n\nWe are also giving priority to supporting small \nagricultural producers. We have been visiting rural \ncommunities every week for two years now, listening \nto people and seeking ways of helping them, such as \nby providing credits, training and infrastructure. The \nresult of this, which is being monitored by the United \nNations Development Programme, is a rebirth of the \nDominican countryside, including improving its ability \nto feed the country and creating employment in rural \ncommunities. Thanks to that and other measures, over \nthe past 18 months in the Dominican Republic overall \npoverty has been reduced by 6 per cent and poverty \nin rural areas by 9 per cent. In other words, in 18 \nmonths we have lifted more than half a million people \nout of poverty. We will continue to work tirelessly, \nimplementing policies that put the economy at the \nservice of the people and taking measures to combat \npoverty and inequality in a sustainable manner, and we \nwill continue to create the basis of what one day will be \na full welfare State in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIt is an honour for us to be one of the signatory \nnations of the founding Charter of the United \nNations, which, as everyone knows, assigned to the \nOrganization its purpose of saving future generations \nfrom the scourge of war. We should recognize that 2014 \nis presenting major challenges to that noble purpose. In \ndifferent latitudes of the world, there have been violent \nconflicts between communities, peoples or States. The \ncontexts of those conflicts are varied, but one thing \nremains constant \u2014 the extent to which past grievances \nshape our identities today, and how dangerous it is to \nallow oneself to be submerged by them. We watch in \nperplexity and indignation the virulence with which \nthese violent conflicts are waged in different parts of \nthe world.\n\nThe Middle East is once again the scene of the \nbloodiest sectarianism, which we condemn from this \nrostrum in all its manifestations. In the history of all \nnations or communities, without exception, there is \na long history of disagreements, misunderstandings \nand quarrels that, at times, can be used to stir up the \nworst passions. They can be manipulated by individuals \nseeking to consolidate power or inflamed by extremist \ngroups that feel that they have nothing to lose. There will \nalways be someone who keeps old disputes alive. There \nwill always be someone who does not mind sacrificing \nthe true interests of the people at the time because of \nthe wrongs of the past recorded in the history books.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of examples to the \ncontrary. Throughout the world, there are people and \ncountries that have managed to leave their past behind \nin order to focus on building the future that they want \nfor their children and new generations. Whether it is \nbuilding bridges between countries once in conflict, as \nthe European Union did, or among communities that \ndecided to share the same nation, as in the case of South \nAfrica. Hope can and must find its way.\n\nI would also like, if I may, to bring a note of \noptimism from our Caribbean region. In the past year, \nwe started a dialogue process with neighbouring Haiti \nthat can rightly be regarded as historic. Our situation is \nof course unique but not to the degree that it cannot be \nechoed in other parts of the world. As members perhaps \nknow, since the birth of our two Republics, there has \nbeen a long history of misunderstanding and disputes, \nwhich led to each of our countries having a distorted \npicture of the other.\n\nIt is true that in our past there were a couple of \npainful chapters, which are part of our identity. \nHowever, if we limit our identity to those few chapters, \nit will be impoverished. Our history is very rich. It has \nhundreds of chapters. In many of them, we can find the \ninspiration to guide us towards a better future and a \nmore complete, richer and more human identity because \nthat is clearly an excellent basis for understanding. In \nboth countries, there are millions of people who want \nbetter development, education, health care, security \nand jobs and more opportunities. Those are concrete \ndemands that require specific measures. The truth is \nthat, by responding to them and reaching agreements \nin each of those areas, in a few months we were able to \nachieve the progress that we had not made in decades.\n\nLittle by little, we are moving forward. We are \ndiscovering that old wounds do not impede advancing \non that path, but that they heal as we move forward. \nOur peoples demanded that we exercise the necessary \n\n\ncourage to take the first step. We will continue to take \nsteps until we achieve our goal of two free, sovereign \nand independent nations that, on the basis of their \nsovereignty, cooperate for the benefit of their respective \npeoples.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity from this rostrum \nat the General Assembly to make an appeal. As I have \nsaid, a new era in Dominican-Haitian relations has \nbegun. In that new phase, we would like to enjoy the \nsupport of the international community. One of our \nmain actions to strengthen Dominican sovereignty and \nto ensure the rights of people living in our territory \nis to provide them all the relevant documentation. As \nmembers know, many of those people are Haitian. In \norder to regularize their status in the territory of the \nDominican Republic, they must first have identity \npapers from their country of origin, which many of them \nunfortunately lack. Haiti is making an effort to reach \nthose Haitians and to provide them with documents \nthat recognize them as its nationals. However, Haiti\u2019s \ntechnical and economic resources are limited. In the \npast, a number of international organizations and \ncountries have expressed their concern about the \nfate of Haitian migrants. We share that concern for \nhumanitarian reasons and because it affects us as the \nmain host country.\n\nI would therefore note that now is an excellent \ntime to move from words to actions. With specific and \nrelatively simple actions, the international community \ncan have a major and lasting impact on the lives of those \npeople. I appeal for help for Haiti. May the international \ncommunity help Haiti to document its people in its \nterritory and in ours, since documentation is the first \nessential step for the enjoyment of a wide-ranging body \nof rights. Let us not allow a few technical shortcomings \nto be an obstacle to such a hopeful and necessary process \nwith as much potential as that new stage of cooperation \nbetween the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\n\nThere are times when our best aspirations seem \nfragile. There are times when cynical people point out, \nunder I do not know what law of the economy or in \nhistory, that we are bound to repeat the mistakes of \nthe past. They say that poverty cannot be overcome, \nthat the gap of inequality will always grow and that \npast grievances will be reborn in each new generation. \nHowever, we know that none of that is true. We know \nwhere to look to find the path of hope. We have only to \nlook at those who are closest, that is, our own people, \ntheir basic daily needs and the hopes that motivate them \nto continue the struggle. If we look carefully, we see \nthat the economy is not a prison but can be a tool for \nimproving the lives of people. We find that the people \nare free. They are free to know which parts of their past \nthey wish to use as a guide to their future and which \nthey wish to leave aside.\n\nWe will find a way to work together, as we have \ndone with the neighbours with whom we share an island, \nor as we found yesterday, during the climate summit, \nwith the other countries with which we share the planet. \nThe citizens that we represent, increasingly better \ninformed, demand that we live up to our responsibility \nand our declared commitment: to preserve peace, to \npromote development and to make education and health \ncare the right of all inhabitants of the planet."

We are \nconfident that he will use his wisdom and experience \nto build consensus on a range of issues on the agenda \nof the General Assembly at this historic session and \neffectively guide its work. Let me therefore assure him \nof the full support and cooperation of my delegation in \nthe successful discharge of his heavy responsibilities. I \nalso wish to commend his predecessor for the excellent \ncontribution he made to ensuring the success of the \nsixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Indeed, \nit was a remarkable session, which laid the foundation \nfor the major task that lies ahead.\n\nThis session is being held at a historic time, when \nwe have embarked upon a major undertaking to shape \nthe future we want for present and future generations. If \nwe do what we must, it could be remembered in history \nas a session that helped us turn the corner in ensuring \neffective custodianship of the environment, economic \njustice and social responsibility. What we agreed over \ntwo years ago in Rio must be what galvanizes our \ncommon effort. We said then that poverty eradication \nis the greatest global challenge facing the world today \nand an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nglobal warming, we are indeed playing a leading role \nin terms of mitigation by scaling up our efforts in \nrenewable energy and promoting energy efficiency. It is \nonly fair and proper that that be adequately recognized \nand supported.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the challenge posed \nby climate change requires leadership and political \ncommitment at all levels. We have no choice but to \nrise to that challenge by taking concrete actions to \nhelp reduce emissions and demonstrating the necessary \npolitical will to achieve a globally binding climate \nagreement by 2015 in Paris. Failure is not an option.\n\nWhat we see here at the United Nations is a \nreadiness on the part of States to think big and focus \non what unites us. That is what underlies the complex \nnegotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. In \nsharp contrast to that, what we are witnessing today is \na general deterioration of the global security situation. \nThe world is passing through a turbulent period, and \nthat is not an exaggeration. The proliferation and \nintensity of conflicts have significantly increased.\n\nIn our part of the world, progress made over the past \ndecade is being undermined by new cycles of violence \nand conflict. The crisis in South Sudan is an example. \nWe in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \n(IGAD) region are doing everything we can to resolve \nthe South Sudanese crisis through peaceful means with \nthe support of the United Nations, the African Union \nand international partners. But progress, let alone \na breakthrough, has not been easy to come by. The \nsituation highlights an often encountered challenge. \nProgress in peacemaking can hardly be contemplated \nwhen there is a lack of sufficient commitment to \na peaceful resolution of a crisis by the parties to the \nconflict. But IGAD is determined to expend every \npossible effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis \nthrough an all-inclusive political dialogue.\n\nIn contrast with the situation in South Sudan and \nwith situations in many parts of the world, the situation \nin Somalia has been improving over the course of the \nyear. Al-Shabaab may not have been entirely removed \nas a threat, but it has been greatly degraded. The recent \nsetback it suffered is bound to speed up its demise. The \nmilitary gains made on the ground cannot, however, \nbe sustained without progress on the political track \nthrough the establishment of local administrations and \nthe maintenance of law and order in the newly liberated \nareas. In that regard, we welcome the establishment \nof interim local administrations in central and south-\nwest Somalia in line with the provisional Federal \nConstitution. We need to continue to support Somalia \nin its efforts to rebuild itself and make a successful \ntransition by 2016.\n\nConflict is not an exclusively African phenomenon. \nWhat has become obvious lately is how much the global \nsecurity situation is becoming a source of concern. \nNever since the end of the cold war has the global \nsecurity situation been as fragile as it is today. The threat \nof terrorism has affected ever greater and wider areas \nof the world. At no time over the past many decades has \nthe need for effective cooperation at the international \nand regional levels been as pressing and as urgent as it \nis today. That the issue of foreign fighters has become \na source of major concern to many is obvious. What is \nrequired to make progress in addressing the challenge is \na readiness to forge cooperation that brooks no double \nstandards. We need to be resolute in our determination \nto work together.\n\nAll that means that at no time in recent memory \nhas multilateralism been as immensely crucial for the \nfuture of the world as it is today. The fact that nations \nare driven by the pursuit of national interests has \nalways been self-evident. But at this juncture in world \nhistory and in the light of the many common challenges \nthat we all face, we have no more realistic option \nthan a commitment to enlightened national interest, \nwhich can be promoted only within the framework of \nmultilateralism.\n\nThat, in our view, is the sentiment that we should \nall share at the beginning of the sixty-ninth session of \nthe General Assembly. We cannot be oblivious to the \nnexus between our sustainable development agenda and \nthe global situation of peace and security. \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d, the theme of this session, \nrequires a peaceful and stable global environment. It is \nalso in that context that the threat of the spread of the \nEbola virus should be viewed. It is both a humanitarian \nand a security challenge. Containing the spread of the \ndeadly virus should be a matter of utmost priority.\n\nLet me reiterate that it is critical that we collectively \naddress the myriad of peace and security challenges \nfacing our world in order to facilitate progress in the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \nin the remaining period and to lay a solid foundation for \nthe realization of our transformative agenda in the post-\n2015 era, as well as to achieve a meaningful climate \nagreement.\n\n\nI wish to conclude by stressing Ethiopia\u2019s \ncommitment to multilateralism, to joining hands with \nall like-minded countries in order to contribute to \nregional and international peace and security and to the \nsuccessful realization of the major projects that we will \nundertake in connection with the post-2015 agenda. \nAs a founding member of the Organization and as a \nmember of the League of Nations \u2014 although Ethiopia \nwas abandoned by the League \u2014 Ethiopia attaches \nthe highest priority to cooperation among peoples \nand countries with a view to addressing common \nchallenges. It is our conviction that might does not \nmake right. There is no substitute for the pursuit of \nmutual advantages as a guideline for a realistic and just \nforeign policy. That is our guide for all the friendships \nand partnerships we have and will continue to develop.\n"

        "file_text": "The world today is much more dangerous than \nwhen we were together here last year. Fear is stronger \nthan hope, I\u2019m afraid. Tragic events have marked \nus. More than 200 schoolgirls were abducted and \nenslaved. An airliner packed with parents, children, \nscientists, tourists and crew members was cut down in \nmid-flight. A mountain people were hunted, trapped \nand slaughtered. And last week, at sea, 500 people were \nshipwrecked, the victims of murderous smugglers.\n\nThose dark episodes disturb us in that they seem \nto herald deeper changes. Public opinion is beginning \nto fear that the world is slipping through our fingers \nand turning to evil. It is as if the political foundation \nof our very existence together is being challenged, as \nif the way individuals and States relate to one another \nis threatened. Our citizens see the rise of obscurantism \nand the forces of fanaticism; they see the boundaries of \na world of yesterday \u2014 of the day before yesterday, of \nan insane world \u2014 reappearing. Yes, as my countryman \nPaul-Henri Spaak said 66 years ago before this same \nAssembly, we are afraid. Ours is not the fear of a coward, \nbut the fear that a man can and should have when he \nlooks to the future and considers all that it may hold of \nhorror and tragedy, and the terrible responsibilities in \nthat future (see A/PV.147, p. 280).\n\n(spoke in English)\nWhen the values we share are under pressure, when \nthe order of things seems to be unravelling, we must \nact. We must bring back our girls and free them from \nBoko Haram. We must allow the families of the victims \nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 to pay their last \nrespects to their loved ones, and keep alive the memory \nof the hopeful people drowned in the Mediterranean. \nAll of us must also mobilize against the barbaric group \nthat is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). \nTogether, we can make the world a safer place again.\n\nWhen looking back upon the past year, the most \nbewildering act in our region, for us in Europe, was \nthe abrupt and illegal annexation of Crimea in March. \nThat violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity triggered the gravest threat to the European \nsecurity order in decades. It matters beyond the \nEuropean continent. It is about rejecting the use of \nforce and about defending the rule of law that upholds \nour society of nations. The General Assembly assumed \nits responsibility by adopting resolution 68/262 on the \nterritorial integrity of Ukraine. Members defended \nthose very values that the Charter of the United Nations \nwas built upon. The European Union welcomes the \nstrong message that the breaking of rules will not be \ntolerated. When you tamper with borders, you tamper \nwith peace.\n\nThe European Union stands firm in its solidarity \nwith Ukraine. It is the Ukrainian people\u2019s right to \ndecide their own political destiny. Europe responded \nto aggression and the violation of international law \nwith a wide range of political, economic and financial \nsanctions. We knew that that could hurt our own \neconomies in return, but together with our international \npartners, we did not relent, since the stability of the \nEuropean house itself was at stake. Now all of us \nmust ensure that the peace process launched in Minsk \nadvances, and that all parties respect the ceasefire \nand abide by the peace plan. The sanctions are not a \ngoal in themselves, and they can be revised, provided \nthat there is tangible progress. We can rebuild trust if \ncommitments are met.\n\nAt the same time, it is essential that Ukraine\u2019s \nauthorities move firmly forward on the path of \n\n\nreforms. Those reforms \u2014 economic, political and \nconstitutional \u2014 will determine the success of a lasting \npolitical solution. The country\u2019s political life and \nprosperity shall belong to all its citizens. An inclusive \nUkraine with a new social contract and a fair balance \nbetween the parts and the whole is the best way to \nsecure the country\u2019s future.\n\nEuropean Union countries and institutions are \nfully committed to supporting Ukraine as it follows \nthat path. The European Union Association Agreement \nwith the Ukraine, which was ratified just last week \nby the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada and the European \nParliament, is a compass and an opportunity to help \nUkraine transform into the dynamic, modern and open \ndemocracy its people deserve. The steps ahead in this \ncooperation will take place within the wider picture of \nthe peace process. With Russia, our biggest neighbour, \nwe are ready to engage and re-establish a basis of trust \nand of promises kept.\n\nThere are nearly 200 countries in this world, but \nmany thousands of minorities. Clearly, there is no other \nway than ensuring inclusiveness, respecting identities \nand giving people a voice. As a Belgian and a European, \nI know it can be a real effort to stay together. It requires \nconstant attention, openness, empathy and willingness \nto adjust. Countries do not have to break up to allow \nfor multiple, often multi-layered, identities to coexist. \nUnity in diversity can work.\n\nThe most pressing concern on all our minds today \nis Iraq, Syria and the wider Middle East. I need not \nsketch the bleak outlook, sinister deeds or unspeakable \nsuffering in the region. What we have seen this past \nsummer has nothing to do with Islam. It is the return \nof barbaric ghosts from a long-forgotten past and \nhorrendous deeds rejecting that we are one humankind \nand denying the very basic values of civilization.\n\nAs the Grand Mufti of Egypt said to me two weeks \nago, ISIL is abusing the name of Islam and the very \nvalues of Islam and of every religion. I welcome the \nstatements made and measures taken by the League of \nArab States, the Organization for Islamic Cooperation \nand Muslim nations against ISIL. It is essential that \nthe parties and neighbours most concerned be at the \nfrontlines of this common fight, but all of us must do \nour share to confront and isolate ISIL, block financial \nflows and weapon flows, cut off illegal oil revenue and \nstop the influx of foreign fighters. European Union \nGovernments are working hard on all those fronts.\n\nAs we know from our own national experience, \nradicalization can strike anywhere: take the young \njihadi fanatic from France who turned torturer in Syria \nand, back in Europe, murdered four innocent victims \nin the Jewish Museum of Belgium, in my hometown of \nBrussels. We need urgent collective action to stop those \nforeign fighters from joining ISIL\u2019s ranks, as so many \nof us underlined in yesterday\u2019s high-level Security \nCouncil meeting (see S/PV.7272). We also must work \ntogether to help the affected countries. Iraq\u2019s new \nGovernment, which is aiming for inclusive leadership, \ndeserves everybody\u2019s full support and certainly has \nours.\n\nHowever, the crisis cannot be resolved without a \npolitical solution for Syria. We owe it to the almost \n200,000 victims and the millions who have had to \nflee their homes. It is quite simply a catastrophe and \none of the international community\u2019s biggest failures. \nWhat is needed is a comprehensive regional solution. \nIt must include, as this summer\u2019s tragic events in \nGaza underlined once more, a two-State solution with \nan independent, democratic, viable Palestinian State \nliving side by side and in peace with Israel and its other \nneighbours.\n\nThe violent dynamics are spreading instability in \nall directions \u2014 into the Sahel region and as far south \nas Nigeria, but also to the east. Those dynamics are \nfostering terrorism, organized crime, arms flows, drugs \ntrafficking, human smuggling and radicalization, as we \nalso see in Libya. I want to pay tribute to France for its \nefforts to help, upon their requests, the Governments \nof Mali and the Central African Republic to restore the \nrule of law and instil inclusiveness and reconciliation \nin close collaboration with the African Union, the \nUnited Nations and the whole of the European Union. \nWe are ready to undertake our responsibility, knowing \nthat we Europeans have no self-interested geostrategic \nobjectives in the area. We turned that page of history \ndecades ago.\n\nA collective approach is important to deal with \nanother tragic symptom of an imploding Middle \nEast: dramatic migration in the Mediterranean. We \nhave seen millions of people fleeing the war in Syria \ninto countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. \nEuropean lifeguards rescue up to 1,000 people a \nweek \u2014 people who risk their lives on small boats \nacross the Mediterranean, looking for a life free from \nfear. Many come from countries where the State \n\n\nstructures have crumbled, where violence is endemic \nand where people\u2019s most basic needs cannot be met.\n\n(spoke in French)\nThe only lasting answer to despair is development. \nI wish to pay tribute to the tireless commitment of \nthe United Nations and of the Secretary-General to \npromoting the development goals, including the post-\n2015 development agenda, and to maintaining a level \nof ambition for our actions that is commensurate with \nthe challenges. I also acknowledge their efforts with \nregard to climate challenge, where Europe remains \ncommitted at the forefront and will demonstrate that \ncommitment at the Paris negotiations next year. I hope \nthat all nations \u2014 large and small, rich and poor \u2014 will \nassume their responsibility.\n\nThe Ebola crisis cruelly reminds us that just as the \nfuture of a country depends on its health facilities, the \nhealth of all may ultimately depend on such structures. \nEbola is the modern plague. The teams of doctors, \nnurses and volunteers must be strengthened. Europe \nstands ready, with others, to help, to relieve and to heal.\n\nThis autumn, we commemorate the centenary of a \ngreat conflict that was the first to lead the entire world \ninto its destructive spiral. It took the Second World War \nfor our nations to pull themselves together and to try \nand build peace together, making the birth of our union \nof nations possible. Although, since then, we have \nmanaged to prevent another world war, we have still \nnot put an end to violence between or within States. \nWe meet today not to lament the unforgivable but to \nnurture hope and to achieve what we must do, that is, \nto act together.\n\n(spoke in English)\nWe must overcome fear. We must overcome fear \nby fighting danger, by restoring justice and by striving \nfor peace so that next year, when our society of nations \nmeets again in New York, we can say, \u201cThe spell of that \ndreadful summer of 2014 has been broken. Step by step, \nwe are making progress. Patiently but relentlessly, we \nare restoring a place for hope.\u201d\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to express my sincerest congratulations to \nMr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident \nthat he will steer the work of this session towards the best \nresults. Allow me also to commend the efforts of Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for \nachieving the objectives of the Organization and for \npromoting international peace and security. I would like \nto thank him in particular for standing with the Libyan \npeople during the revolution against the dictatorship and \nfor providing support for our nascent democracy after the \nrevolution.\n\nI am honoured to stand before members today as \nthe representative of the Libyan people to describe their \nambitions, pains and hopes, to participate in the quest \nfor the best ways to maintain peace and security on our \nplanet and to achieve the common aspirations of our \npeoples. There is no doubt that those who witnessed the \nrevolution of the Libyan people against dictatorship in \n2011 were impressed by the courage, unity, awareness \nand creative capabilities of our people. But today there \nis no doubt that many are astonished by events in \nLibya \u2014 the fighting, the bloodshed among brothers, \nthe unjustified destruction of infrastructure and public \nand private property. Many may wonder, where are \nthe people they saw three years ago? Where are the \nunarmed revolutionaries who flocked into the streets, \nfacing bullets with their bare chests to defend their \nrights? Where are the intellectuals who flooded the \nmedia with realistic assessments and convinced the \nworld of the justice of their people\u2019s cause?\n\nI would say, yes, that was the true Libyan people. \nThey did not think in terms of material gains or leadership \npositions. Their only aspiration was to put an end to \ndictatorship and pave the road for democracy to ensure \na prosperous future for all Libyans. Unfortunately, \nLibya today is in a completely different situation. Most \nof the activists have left the political arena, either \nbecause of the forcibly imposed political isolation law \nor because of the campaigns of intimidation, arrests and \nassassinations perpetrated by various armed groups \nagainst anyone who opposes their views or calls for \ntheir disarmament and demobilization.\n\nSome armed groups are no longer subject to the \nGovernment\u2019s direction as they try to impose their \nwill on the Libyan people by force, violate human \nrights and blackmail the Government to gain access \nto funds, while they refuse to arm the police and to \n\nreinstitute, reconstruct and arm the army. The existing \nconflict in and around Tripoli among armed groups \nthat opposed the legitimate authorities has forced the \nGovernment to evacuate all of its premises, which \nwere seized by a coalition of armed groups. Those \nincluded a terrorist group that professes Al-Qaida \nideology and is known for its stand against the building \nof State institutions \u2014 a group placed on the list of \nterrorist organizations by the United States and the \nEuropean Union. Moreover, the residences of many \nministers and citizens were looted and burned down. \nThat group is still waging war on the region west of \nthe city of Tripoli, inhabited by the Warshafana tribe. \nThe indiscriminate shelling with heavy weaponry led \nto the exodus of most of its population, which then led \nthe House of Representatives to declare it a disaster \narea. That could not have happened if the international \ncommunity had taken the situation in Libya seriously, \nassisted the Government in establishing a strong army, \nexerted pressure to ensure the disarmament of armed \ngroups and supported the arming of the police.\n\nThe armed groups that captured the capital have \nclearly declared their opposition to the legitimate \ninstitutions of the State and their quest to overthrow \nthe elected House of Representatives and the elected \nGovernment, in an apparent effort to derail the process \nof democratic transition and topple the legitimate \nauthorities by forming a parallel Government. \nFurthermore, that has not sufficed for the group that \ncontrols Tripoli. It has also persecuted political activists, \nhuman rights defenders and journalists, shut down \nmedia channels and forcibly prevented opponents from \ndemonstrating in the city of Tripoli and other cities. It \nhas recruited media personnel and some radical clerics \nto incite the killing of those with different opinions and \nthose who support the elected House of Representatives \nand the Government.\n\nThe group has allied itself with Ansar Al-Sharia, \nwhich professes the ideology of Al-Qaida. It has \npractised terrorism in some Libyan cities, especially \nBenghazi and Derna. It has provided a safe haven and \ntraining camps for terrorists from all over the world, \nincluding Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt and Mali, with \nunrivalled financial and media support from outside the \ncountry, in order to undermine the legitimate Libyan \nauthorities and enable it to implement its conspiracy.\n\nI wish the Assembly to know that turning a blind eye \nto terrorism in Libya is no longer acceptable. Our people \ncan no longer tolerate assassinations, humiliation, \nintimidation, suppression of freedoms or human rights \nviolations based on an individual\u2019s background and \nbelief. The international community can either stand \nwith the elected legitimate authorities and implement \nSecurity Council resolution 2174 (2014) by imposing \nsanctions on those who impede the political process, \nundermine security and seize State institutions, or \naffirm loudly and clearly that the Libyans have to take \non terrorism single-handedly. Surely, the international \ncommunity must take action to withstand the effects \nof the expansion of terrorism in North Africa and the \nSahel region.\n\nWe are in need of substantial assistance from \nLibya\u2019s friends \u2014 help in rebuilding the army and \nproviding it with all it needs to stop the fighting among \nbrothers and battle terrorism and extremism, which \nnow form a broad front stretching from Iraq to Algeria. \nThat front cannot be eliminated without an alliance \nof the States concerned to ensure the elimination \nof terrorism and guarantee the dissemination of the \nprinciples of tolerance and democracy. The failure to \nprovide arms and training to the Libyan army in its war \nagainst terrorism serves the interests of extremism, \nadds to instability in Libya, disrupts calm in the region \nand threatens global peace.\n\nWe welcome all efforts and goodwill by friendly \ncountries, the United Nations, the League of Arab States \nand the African Union to help the legitimate Libyan \nauthorities regain control, either by taking a bold stand \nwith the House of Representatives, the Government and \nthe constitution-drafting body and by persuading armed \ngroups to give up their arms, withdraw from State \ninstitutions and obey the Government\u2019s directions, or \nby exerting pressure on the political movements and \narmed groups so that they renounce violence and agree \nto a dialogue on the priorities and future of Libya.\n\nEvery illegitimate contact, unauthorized by the \nGovernment, of any foreign country with individuals, \ngroups and organizations that do not recognize the \nGovernment\u2019s authority or that of the elected House \nof Representatives and that use violence as a means \nto impose their views on the Libyan people will be \nconsidered by the Government an unfriendly act against \nthe unity and stability of Libya. Hence, all necessary \nmeasures will be taken to confront it.\n\nThe Libyan people, under the leadership of the \nlegitimate authority, will not submit to blackmail and \nintimidation and will resist any attempt to impose \na totalitarian dictatorship, whatever its slogan. We \n\n\nwish that the Government did not need the assistance \nof brotherly and friendly countries to extend State \nauthority over its territory and eliminate the terrorism \nand criminality that threaten Libya\u2019s security and unity, \ncausing the displacement of hundreds of thousands from \ntheir homes in various parts of Libya and destroying \nthe economy.\n\nThe House of Representatives and the Government \nare determined to pursue the path of dialogue and \ntolerance within the framework of legitimacy, solve \nall the problems and differences between Libyans, \nagree on priorities, respect the democratic process and \nre-establish the rule of law and the holding of elections. \nThey are also determined to demobilize all armed \ngroups and to stop their funding by the end of the \ncurrent year. We hope that the international community \nwill help us to carry out the following measures.\n\nFirst, we must ensure the establishment by the \nState of defence and security organs and make the \nGovernment the sole, legitimate authority capable \nof using force in disarming the armed groups and \nexercising its authority over all Libya\u2019s territory.\n\nSecondly, we must ensure Government control \nover the capital, Tripoli, and the withdrawal of armed \ngroups from State institutions so that officials can work \nwithout being threatened and provide services to the \ncitizens.\n\nThirdly, we must realize that the establishment of \nillegal institutions set up in parallel with the existing \nbodies is impeding the political process and is subject \nto sanctions under Security Council resolution 2174 \n(2014).\n\nFourthly, we must establish genuine, active \ncooperation in combating terrorism through a strategic \nalliance between Libya and its neighbouring countries \nnorth and south of the Mediterranean.\n\nLastly, we must strengthen the culture of dialogue, \nwithout exclusion or marginalization, and, with the help \nof the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, the \nneighbouring countries, the League of Arab States and \nthe African Union, initiate a comprehensive dialogue \nfor all Libyan people.\n\nAs the General Assembly begins its deliberations \nat its sixty-ninth session, whose main theme is the post-\n2015 development agenda, I would like to point out \nthat when the Millennium Development Goals were \nset, Libya started to review its economic policies and \nrestructure its economy to achieve them. However, \nthe deteriorating security situation has disrupted the \neconomy. I would like to note the close interlinkages \namong security, stability and development. Without \nsecurity, there will be no development, and vice versa. \nTherefore, restoring security and stability in Libya is \nkey to advancing development, bringing the disrupted \neconomy back on track, achieving the remaining \nMillennium Development Goals and preparing to \nachieve the post-2015 development goals, once they are \nadopted.\n\nLibya looks forward to the support of the United \nNations and friendly countries in restoring security \nand the capacity-building of military and security \ninstitutions in order to ensure the launch of programmes \nfor reconstruction and development. We also look \nforward to the assistance of all countries in tracing looted \nfunds abroad and repatriating them to enable Libya to \nincrease funding for development and infrastructure \nprogrammes. That will help eliminate unemployment \nand absorb a large numbers of foreign workers, estimated \nat several millions, from neighbouring countries. Both \nLibya and the neighbouring countries would benefit, \nand illegal immigration to Europe of people in search \nof work and decent living conditions would be reduced.\n\nDespite the circumstances in Libya, we cannot \nforget the tragedy of the Palestinian people and their \nsuffering. They have taken refuge in various countries \naround the world because of the Israeli occupation. We \nreaffirm our condemnation of the Israeli occupation \nand its practices in the Palestinian and Arab occupied \nterritories. We call for the Security Council to \nprovide protection for the Palestinian people, set a \ntimetable to end the Israeli occupation and establish \nan independent and sovereign Palestinian State on all \nthe Palestinian territories, with East Jerusalem as its \ncapital. The Palestinian State should be a full member \nof all international organizations. Palestinian refugees \nshould be entitled to return to their lands, from which \nthey were expelled.\n\nThe continued blockade and repeated Israeli \naggression against the Gaza Strip and the destruction \nof infrastructure have brought shame on civilized \nhuman beings. The international community should be \ncommitted to the reconstruction of Gaza, preventing \nthe recurrence of destruction and killing by the Israeli \narmy, ensuring the prosecution of all those responsible \nfor war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip and \nsupporting the efforts of the Government of national \n\nreconciliation, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud \nAbbas.\n"

        "file_text": "\nIt is a great \nsatisfaction for Brazil, which has the honour and \nprivilege of opening this debate, to have as the President \nof this session of the General Assembly a son of Africa. \nAs Brazilians we are united by ties of history, culture \nand friendship with the African continent, whose \nlegacy was and always will be decisive for my country\u2019s \nnational identity.\n\nI open this general debate on the eve of elections \nin Brazil that will determine the President of the \nRepublic, State governors and a significant portion of \nour Congress. Those elections represent the celebration \nof a democracy we achieved almost 30 years ago, after \ntwo decades of dictatorial rule. Through democracy we \nalso advanced towards the country\u2019s economic stability.\n\nDuring the past 12 years in particular, we have \nconsolidated those achievements by building an \ninclusive society based on equal opportunity. The great \ntransformation to which we are committed has resulted \nin a modern economy and a more egalitarian society. At \nthe same time it has required strong civic participation, \n\n\nrespect for human rights and a sustainable vision of \ndevelopment. Lastly, it has also required an engagement \non the world stage characterized by a multilateral \napproach, respect for international law, the quest for \npeace and a culture of solidarity.\n\nA few days ago, the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations announced that \nBrazil is no longer on the World Hunger Map. That \ntransformation is the result of economic policies that \nhave generated 21 million jobs, raised the minimum \nwage and increased its purchasing power by 71 per cent \nin the past 12 years. Those policies have also reduced \ninequality. Since 2003, 36 million Brazilians have been \nlifted out of extreme poverty, 22 million of them during \nmy Administration alone. Social policies and income- \ntransfer programmes, coordinated within our plan for a \nBrazil without extreme poverty, have also contributed \nto those results. On the health-care front, we have been \nable to meet our target for reduced child mortality \nbefore the deadline set by the Millennium Development \nGoals.\n\nWe have also made access to basic primary and \nmiddle-school education universally available, and we \nare now pursuing the same goal for secondary education. \nWe are equally committed to enhancing the quality of \neducation by, inter alia, improving curriculums and \nraising the profile of teachers. Vocational education \nhas made strides, with the creation of hundreds of new \nschools and the professional training and development \nof 8 million young people over the past four years. \nThere has been an unprecedented expansion of higher \neducation, with the establishment of new publicly \nfunded universities and of scholarships and financial \naid that has given 3 million students access to private \nuniversities. Affirmative-action policies have enabled \npoor, black and indigenous students to enrol in \nuniversities on a massive scale.\n\nFinally, our efforts to tackle the challenges \nof building a knowledge-based society have led \nto the creation of a programme known as Science \nWithout Borders, which has sent more than 100,000 \nundergraduate and graduate students to the world\u2019s \nbest universities. Through a presidential initiative, our \nNational Congress has enacted legislation allocating \nto education 75 per cent of the royalties earned from \npre-salt oil exploration and 50 per cent of the social \nfund generated by pre-salt oil revenues, with 25 per \ncent of pre-salt oil exploration royalties going to health \ncare. We will thus be able to transform finite resources \nsuch as oil and gas into permanent assets \u2014 education, \nscience and technology, and innovation. That will be \nour passport to the future.\n\nWe have not neglected fiscal discipline and \nmonetary stability, and we have striven to protect \nBrazil from external volatility. We were thus able to \novercome the challenges arising from the major global \neconomic crisis, triggered in 2008 by the collapse of \nLehman Brothers, which subsequently developed into \nnational sovereign debt crises affecting many countries. \nWe resisted its worst consequences \u2014 unemployment, \nwage depreciation, erosion of social rights and \nstalled investment. We followed through with income \ndistribution by stimulating growth and employment and \nmaintaining our investment in infrastructure. Brazil \njumped from the thirteenth- to the seventh-largest \neconomy in the world. Our per capita income more than \ntripled, and inequality fell sharply. In 2002, more than \nhalf of Brazil\u2019s population was poor or living below the \npoverty line; today three out of every four Brazilians \nare firmly in the middle-class and upper-income \nranges. During the economic crisis, when hundreds of \nmillions around the world were left unemployed, Brazil \ncreated 12 million new jobs. In addition, we became \na primary destination for foreign investment, and we \nresumed our investment in infrastructure through \nstrong partnerships with the private sector.\n\nAll of those gains have occurred within the context \nof a sound fiscal environment. We have reduced our \nnet ratio of public debt to gross domestic product \n(GDP) from about 60 per cent to 35 per cent. Our gross \nexternal debt in relation to GDP fell from 42 per cent \nto 14 per cent. Our international reserves increased \ntenfold, making Brazil an international creditor. Our \nannual inflation rate has also remained within the \nmaximum and minimum range fixed by our current \nnational targets.\n\nAlthough we have managed to fend off the most \nharmful consequences of the global crisis, we have \nnonetheless been acutely affected by it in the past \nfew years, owing to the persistence all over the world \nof substantial economic difficulties that have had a \nnegative effect on our growth. Here I would like to \nreiterate what I said at the opening of last year\u2019s general \ndebate (see A/68/PV.5). It is vital and urgent that we \nrestore the momentum of the global economy, which \nshould work to drive investment and international \ntrade and reduce inequalities between countries, and \nnot become a factor that ultimately slows economic \n\n\ndevelopment and income distribution in society as a \nwhole.\n\nRegarding international trade, there must be a \nunanimous commitment to an action plan leading to the \nconclusion of the Doha Round. It is also imperative that \nwe end the disparity between the growing importance \nof developing countries to the global economy and their \ninsufficient representation and participation in the \ndecision-making processes of international financial \ninstitutions such as the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank. The delay in expanding \ndeveloping countries\u2019 voting rights in those institutions \nis unacceptable. The risk to those institutions is that \ncould lose their legitimacy and effectiveness.\n\nIn July Brazil had the pleasure of hosting the \nsixth Summit of the BRICS countries, namely, Brazil, \nRussia, India, China and South Africa. We welcomed \ntheir leaders in a fraternal and fruitful meeting that \npointed to important possibilities for the future. We \nsigned agreements establishing a new development \nbank and a contingent reserve arrangement. The bank \nwill cater to the infrastructure financing needs of the \nBRICS and other developing countries. The contingent \nreserve arrangement will protect them from financial \nvolatility. Each instrument will have a capital injection \nof $100 billion.\n\nThe current generation of world leaders \u2014 our \ngeneration \u2014 is also being called on to deal with significant \nchallenges to peace, collective security and the \nenvironment. We have been unable either to solve old \ndisputes or to prevent new threats. It is impossible to \neliminate the underlying causes of conflict through the \nuse of force. That has been made clear by the persistence \nof the Palestine question, the systematic massacre of \nthe Syrian people, the tragic national fragmentation of \nIraq, the serious insecurity in Libya, the conflicts in the \nSahel and the clashes in Ukraine. Instead of leading to \npeace, every military intervention has worsened those \nconflicts. We are witnessing the tragic proliferation \nof civilian victims and humanitarian disasters. We \ncannot allow such barbaric acts to increase and violate \nour ethical, moral and civilizational values. Nor can \nwe remain indifferent to the spread of the Ebola virus \nin West Africa. We therefore support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposal to establish a United Nations \nMission for Ebola Emergency Response. Brazil is \nsolidly in favour of it.\n\nThe Security Council has had some difficulties \nin promoting peaceful solutions to those conflicts. \nTo overcome such stalemates, a genuine reform of \nthe Council will be required, a process that has been \ndragging on for quite some time. The coming seventieth \nanniversary of the United Nations, in 2015, appears to \nbe an occasion conducive to achieving the progress \nthat the situation currently calls for. I am quite certain \nthat we all understand the serious risks arising from \nparalysis and inaction in the Security Council. A more \nrepresentative and legitimate Security Council would \nalso be more effective.\n\nI wish to underscore that we cannot possibly remain \nindifferent to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, particularly \nafter the recent dramatic events in Gaza. We condemn \nthe disproportionate use of force that has strongly \nvictimized the civilian population, especially women \nand children. The conflict must be properly resolved, \nnot precariously managed, as has been the case up to \nnow. Effective negotiations between the parties must \nultimately lead to a two-State solution with Palestine \nand Israel living side by side in security within \ninternationally recognized borders.\n\nAmid so many conflict situations, Latin America \nand the Caribbean seek to face up to the main problem \nthat has marked our region for centuries. I am talking \nabout social inequality. Democratic roots have become \nstronger, and the demand for more just, inclusive and \nsustainable growth has grown ever stronger. Through \nthe Union of South American Nations, the Common \nMarket of the South, and the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States, integration efforts \nhave made tremendous headway.\n\nClimate change is one of the greatest challenges of \nour times. To overcome that challenge, we need a sense \nof urgency, political courage and a keen understanding \nthat actors have to contribute according to the \nprinciples of equity and common but differentiated \nresponsibilities. The recent Climate Summit, which was \nconvened in a very timely manner by the Secretary-\nGeneral, further invigorated negotiations at the level of \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange.\n\nThe Brazilian Government will strive to ensure \nthat the outcome of the negotiations will lead to a \nbalanced, fair and effective agreement. Brazil has been \ndoing its part to face up to the challenge of climate \nchange. In 2009, during the Copenhagen Conference, \nwe committed to a voluntary reduction of 36 to 39 per \ncent of our projected emissions by 2020. Between 2010 \nand 2013, we avoided releasing into the atmosphere an \n\n\naverage of 650 million tons of carbon dioxide every \nyear. Throughout those years, we achieved the lowest \ndeforestation rates in our history. In the past decade, \nwe have reduced deforestation by 79 per cent, without \ngiving up our agenda of economic development and \nsocial inclusion.\n\nWe have therefore shown that it is possible to \ngrow, to include, to preserve and to protect. Such an \nachievement stems from the continuous and steadfast \ncommitment of the Brazilian Government, civil society \nand other public and private stakeholders. We hope \nthat developed countries, which have not only the \nlegal but also a political obligation to lead by example, \nwill unequivocally and concretely demonstrate their \ncommitment to combat this problem that affects us all.\n\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, we were proud to set \nthe foundations for a new development agenda, based \non sustainable development goals applicable to both \ndeveloping and developed nations. It will be crucial \nfor us to identify the means of implementation that \ncorrespond to the magnitude of the challenges that we \nhave committed ourselves to overcoming. We must be \nambitious when it comes to financing, cooperation, \nnational capacity-building and technology transfer, \nespecially to ensure that the least developed countries \nbenefit. Let me underscore, in that context, the need to \nestablish a mechanism for the development, transfer and \ndissemination of clean, environmentally sustainable \ntechnologies.\n\nIn addition to sustainable development and peace, \nthe international order that we seek to build must be \nanchored on fundamental values. Among those values, \nemphasis should be put on efforts to combat all forms \nof discrimination and exclusion. We have a clear-cut \ncommitment to the empowerment of women in the \nlabour market, liberal professions, entrepreneurship, \npolitical activity and access to education, among others. \nMy Administration has tirelessly fought violence \nagainst women in all its forms. We consider the twenty-\nfirst century to be the century of women.\n\nBy the same token, the promotion of racial equality \nseeks to compensate Brazilians of African descent for \nthe consequences of the centuries of slavery to which \nthey were subjected. Today, those Brazilians account \nfor more than half of our population. We owe them our \nrich and permanent legacy of cultural, religious and \nhuman wealth and values. For us, racial miscegenation \nis a matter of pride. Racism is not only a heinous and \nextremely serious crime, but it is also a scourge that we \nhave not hesitated to fight, punish and eradicate.\n\nThe same commitment that we have had to combat \nviolence against women and African Brazilians, we \nhave also had against homophobia. My country\u2019s \nSupreme Court has recognized same-sex civil unions, \nthereby ensuring them the full range of civil rights \narising therefrom. We firmly believe in the dignity of \nall human beings and in the universal nature of their \nfundamental rights. Those rights must be protected \nfrom all double standards and all forms of politicization, \nboth domestically and internationally.\n\nYet another fundamental value is the respect for \npublic good. We all face a relentless fight against \ncorruption. History has shown that there is only one \ncorrect and efficient way to tackle corruption; that is \nby ending impunity, thereby strengthening institutions \nthat oversee, investigate and punish acts of corruption, \nmoney-laundering and other financial crimes. That is \na responsibility incumbent upon each Government, a \nresponsibility that Brazil has fulfilled by strengthening \nour institutions.\n\nIn Brazil, we have designed and built a Government \ntransparency portal website that gives citizens access \nto all information on Government spending within 24 \nhours after monies are spent. We have also adopted \na law on access to information, which allows all \nBrazilian citizens the right to access Government \ndata, except for that related to the country\u2019s national \nsovereignty. We have strengthened and given autonomy \nto investigators as well as to those in charge of internal \nGovernment controls. We have passed laws that punish \nnot only those who actively engage in corruption but \nalso those who passively agree with acts of corruption. \nStrengthening those institutions is absolutely crucial \nfor strengthening open and democratic governance. \nBrazil\u2019s recent re-election to the Executive Committee \nof the Open Government Partnership will also allow \nus to contribute to promoting more transparent \nGovernments worldwide.\n\nIt is essential that measures be taken to effectively \nprotect human rights, not only in the real world but \nalso in the virtual world, as stated in resolution 68/167 \non privacy in the digital age, adopted by the General \nAssembly in the past year. Brazil and Germany \npromoted an important discussion on the matter in \n2013. We intend to deepen that discussion during this \nsixty-ninth session. For our review of such matters, the \n2013 annual report of the Office of the United Nations \n\n\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, published in \nMay 2014, can provide significant inputs. In September \n2013, I proposed from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.5) that \na civil framework be development for the governance \nand use of the Internet, a framework based on the \nprinciples of freedom of expression, privacy, network \nneutrality and cultural diversity. \n\nI am pleased to note that the international community \nhas, since then, mobilized its efforts to enhance the \ncurrent Internet governance architecture. Brazil\u2019s \ninitiative to hold the Global Multistakeholder Meeting \non the Future of Internet Governance, NETmundial, in \nS\u00e3o Paulo in April was an important step in the process. \nThe Meeting brought together stakeholders from \nvarious regions of the world and from multiple sectors. \nDiscussions were held on the principles that should be \nfollowed and the actions to be undertaken in order to \nensure that the Internet will continue to develop in an \nopen, democratic, free, multisectoral and multilateral \nmanner.\n\nThe United Nations and its Member States have \nbefore them today challenges of great magnitude, which \nshould be the priorities of this session of the General \nAssembly. The year 2015 must be a turning point. I am \ncertain that we will not shy away from fulfilling, with a \nsense of courage and insight, our lofty responsibilities \nto build an international order founded on the promotion \nof peace, sustainable development, poverty eradication \nand the reduction of inequality. Brazil stands ready and \nis fully determined to contribute to that end.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is with \ngreat honour and a special sense of responsibility that \nI address the General Assembly today. My country has \nchosen a European future, and that will make Moldova \nstronger and more prosperous. This year we have \nsigned, ratified and are already provisionally applying \nthe new Association Agreement with the European \nUnion (EU). The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade \nArea, an integral part of the Agreement, opens new \nperspectives for Moldova\u2019s access to European and \nworld markets. That will make our economy more \ncompetitive, stimulate economic growth and integrate \nMoldova into the mainstream of global trade, with all \nits benefits. The implementation of the Agreement is \nour short-term priority. Our next goal is to apply for \nfull-fledged European Union membership.\n\nNow that we have defined our path and established \nthe framework for our further development, we must \nfocus on systemic improvements. Strengthening \ndemocracy and the rule of law, improving our investment \nclimate, developing rural areas and enhancing our \nenergy security \u2014 those are the objectives to be \naccomplished in the near term.\n\nWe are grateful to all our development partners \nfor supporting Moldova\u2019s modernization agenda. \nThey have helped us to strengthen good governance, \npromote justice and domestic reforms, support the \nmodernization of the agricultural sector and implement \nenergy interconnection projects. Just recently, a new \npipeline was completed that connects Moldova via \nRomania to the European Union\u2019s gas network. That \nand other strategic projects connecting Moldova to \nEurope, including power grids, roads and bridges, will \nbe implemented in coming years.\n\nOur ambitions, however, will not be fulfilled if \nthe benefits of closer association with Europe are not \nfully shared by our citizens living in the Transnistrian \nregion of the Republic of Moldova. Just like the rest \nof Moldova, people and businesses in that region want \nthe development opportunities that association with the \nEuropean Union clearly brings. The Free Trade Area \nwith the European Union will increase production \nand exports. Jobs, salaries, pensions and benefits will \ntherefore rise significantly.\n\nVisa-free travel by all Moldovan citizens to the \nEuropean Union as of April this year, along with new \ntrade and investment opportunities, are just a few real \nexamples that demonstrate that Moldova is on the \nright track. However, alongside the conflict-settlement \nprocess, we will continue focusing on building \nconfidence among citizens, the private sector and all \nother stakeholders of the entire country.\n\nAgainst that background, the resolution of the \nTransnistrian conflict and the reintegration of Moldova \nis another top priority for my Government. In our effort \nto resolve the conflict, our goal remains the same: to \nachieve a political settlement based on respect for the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \n\n\nof Moldova, with a special political status for its \nTransnistrian region. All of our international partners \ninvolved in the settlement process agree on those basic \nprinciples. And today more than ever before, we need \ntheir united and proactive support to help solve that \nprotracted conflict.\n\nDiscussions on the political and security aspects \nof the conflict should be resumed without delay \nwithin the 5+2 format for negotiations. There are other \noutstanding issues that create additional obstacles to the \nsettlement process. The continuing presence of Russia\u2019s \nmilitary forces and ammunition in the Transnistrian \nregion, contrary to international commitments and the \nConstitution of the Republic of Moldova, is one of those \nissues. We expect the Russian Federation to finalize the \nwithdrawal process without any further delay. We also \nbelieve that bringing the peacekeeping arrangement in \nline with international standards by transforming the \ncurrent operation into a civilian multinational mission \nwould provide a positive impulse to the settlement \nprocess.\n\nMoldova seeks to develop fruitful relations with \nall its partners in the East and West. In the past five \nyears, my Government has promoted a coherent and \npredictable foreign-policy agenda, which is based \non our European integration choice. Regrettably, \nMoldova currently faces unjustified trade restrictions \non the export of its agricultural products to the Russian \nFederation. Trade relations in the whole Commonwealth \nof Independent States (CIS) region have been affected, \nbut we nevertheless hope that a continuing dialogue \nwith our Russian partners, based on the World Trade \nOrganization and CIS rules, will contribute to the \nresumption of normal trade relations with Russia. We \nare grateful for the assistance of our trading partners, \nparticularly the European Union, for supporting the \nGovernment in its efforts to lessen the immediate \nimpact of the restrictions on Moldovan farmers and \nproducers. Full liberalization of the European Union \nmarket for Moldovan wines and agriculture products, \nas well as a new free-trade-area agreement with Turkey, \nwill contribute to market diversification in the future. \nWe will continue to explore new trade partnerships in \nthe world.\n\nWe have followed with great concern the \ndevelopments in Ukraine. A year ago, no one could \nhave imagined that Ukraine would be plunged into such \na painful and profound crisis. At the very same time, \nUkraine, like Moldova, has also established a path for \nEuropean integration, and that offers a real chance \nfor improving people\u2019s well-being while facilitating \nreconciliation, reconstruction and security. We believe \nthat the sovereign choices of all members of the \ninternational community should be respected.\n\nWe recall the need for all members of the \ninternational community to respect the provisions of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law. \nLike many other countries, we will never recognize \nthe annexation of Crimea. We also encourage any \ninvolvement by the international community, in \nparticular by the United Nations and the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, in actions to \nstabilize the situation on the ground. The sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of our neighbour Ukraine must \nbe respected.\n\nToday we face new and increasingly complex \nsecurity challenges. Moldova is doing its part to address \nthose challenges by making its own contribution to the \npromotion of peace, security and stability in Europe \nand in the international arena. We have taken concrete \nmeasures to support United Nations, EU and NATO \nefforts in that regard. This year, Moldova deployed 41 \nsoldiers to the NATO-led International Security Force \nin Kosovo operation, under the authority of the Security \nCouncil, and contributed to the EU Training Mission in \nMali. That represents a new level of commitment by \nMoldova to promoting international peace, security and \nstability.\n\nMoldova is committed to protecting human \nrights at the national and international levels. We \nhave made steady progress in the implementation of \nthe relevant United Nations special procedures and \nrecommendations. Moldova has volunteered to present \na mid-term evaluation report on the Universal Periodic \nReview recommendations in the area of human rights \nby October.\n\nAt the same time, a national strategic programme \nfor demographic security until 2025 is currently being \nimplemented in the Republic of Moldova. We want to \nbecome a regional centre of excellence for the best \npolicies in reproductive health and to contribute to the \nobjectives of the United Nations Population Fund.\n\nMoldova also shares its best practices on migration \nand development with other countries in the eastern and \nsouthern neighbourhoods of the European Union. We \nare actively engaged in the work of the Global Forum \non Migration and Development.\n\n\n\nMoldova also supports the advancement of a \nfree and independent society, including freedom of \nexpression on the Internet and in other media. For \nthe past three years, my country has had one of the \nbest and most affordable Internet connections in the \nworld. More than 65 per cent of Moldovans access the \nInternet at least once a day. That is why I am proud \nthat Moldova was accepted this year as a member of the \nFreedom Online Coalition. Moldova\u2019s membership of \nthe Open Government Partnership is another important \ncontribution to the commitments made with regard to \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are currently \nimplementing a comprehensive e-governance agenda. \nToday, Moldova is one of the first countries of the \nregion, and among the first 16 countries in the world, to \nhave an open data portal. Just recently, in August, the \nGovernment of Moldova approved the new Open Data \nPolicy in line with the Open Data Charter of the Group \nof Eight.\n\nWe have taken one step forward in agreeing on \na new post-2015 development agenda and a new set \nof sustainable development goals. My country will \ncontinue to contribute to that effort by hosting, in \nFebruary 2015, an event at which we will consolidate \nand endorse the conclusions of the high-level dialogue \non capacity-building and sustainable development.\n\nLet me reiterate Moldova\u2019s commitment to \npromoting the core principles of the Organization and \nto assisting the international community in delivering \non the greatest promise of the United Nations \u2014 peace, \njustice, security and development for the people of the \nworld.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me \ngreat pleasure to express my sincere congratulations \nto the President on his well-deserved election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session. We are confident that his wisdom and \nexperience will ensure constructive and fruitful \ndeliberations on the very important and vital issues \nbefore the Assembly. I should like to assure him of the \nfull cooperation of my delegation to that end. I also \nexpress my deep appreciation to his predecessor and \nmy gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ncompetent and excellent leadership of the Organization.\n\nI am delighted to report to the Assembly that \nAfghanistan has achieved a significant milestone \nwith the successful conclusion of its presidential \nelections, including the important task of recounting \nthe votes. The new President, Mr. Mohammad Ashraf \nGhani Ahmadzai, will be sworn in on 29 September. \nAfghanistan is witnessing the transfer of power from one \nelected administration to the next. While Afghanistan \nfaces marked challenges, we are confident that the new \nGovernment, which enjoys the full backing of the vast \nmajority of Afghans, will strive to bring about political \nsecurity and socioeconomic prosperity to Afghanistan \nand, by extension, to the region and beyond.\n\nIt was more than a decade ago that many countries \nof the world joined the Afghan people in their struggle \nfor peace and fought against the forces of extremism \nand terrorism. In that regard, we have collectively \nachieved tangible results. Unfortunately, however, \nthe menace of terrorism and extremism continues to \nthreaten security, socioeconomic development and \npeace, not only in Afghanistan but also in the region. \nThere is an urgent need for a comprehensive response \nto the threats from terrorism, drugs and extremism at \nthe regional and international levels.\n\nToday, Afghanistan has credible political \ninstitutions, an elected Parliament, a Constitution \nand elected provincial councils supported by the \nbrave Afghan National Security Forces. The people \nof Afghanistan have witnessed many positive \nachievements in the past decade, including in the fields \nof socioeconomic development, education \u2014 especially \neducation for our girls \u2014 health, communications \nand information technology, and the promotion and \nprotection of human rights, including particularly \nthe rights of women. Afghanistan has one of the \nmost dynamic media scenes in the region, propelled \nby the freedom of expression that the Afghan people \nhave enjoyed for more than a decade. We should also \nunderscore the pioneering spirit of our youth, who are \nbehind much of the innovativeness and diversity of \nthought in academia and in the private sector.\n\nThe Afghan people appreciate and thank the \ninternational community for the vital support that it has \ngiven the country to build security, peace and prosperity \nin Afghanistan. We look forward to continued mutual \ncooperation with the international community to \nprotect our achievements and ensure the sustainability \nof a strong partnership.\n\nThe transfer of security responsibilities from the \ninternational forces to the Afghan National Security \nForces for the whole of Afghanistan, launched in the \nsummer of 2011, will be achieved by the end of 2014. \n\n\nAs we speak, Afghan forces are providing security \nindependently across the country, despite increasing \nacts of terrorism inside Afghanistan, which are being \ncommitted with support from terrorists from beyond \nour borders. The growing levels of violent extremism \nand the alarming developments in the Middle East and \nother parts of the world make international support \nfor the NATO mission in Afghanistan even more \nimperative.\n\nParallel to our ongoing efforts to enhance the \ncapacity and capabilities of our National Security \nForces, the Afghan Government is also pursuing a \ndialogue to achieve peace through political means and \nreconciliation. We have put in place clear conditions \nin order for that process to be accepted by the Afghan \npeople. For instance, we demand the renunciation of \nviolence and respect for Afghanistan\u2019s Constitution, as \nit guarantees full and equal rights to Afghan men and \nwomen and is the only tool for the preservation of our \ncollective achievements of the past decade.\n\nAfghanistan strongly believes in comprehensive, \nlong-term, friendly and good-neighbourly relations \nbetween Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fight against \nterrorism and the strengthening of peace and stability \nbetween the two nations in the region. At the same time, \nwe would like to express our serious concern over the \nrocket attacks by Pakistani forces onto Afghanistan\u2019s \nsoil. The continuation of such attacks is unacceptable \nto Afghanistan. We hope that the Government of \nPakistan, considering our common interests in ensuring \npeace and stability, will put an end to any kind of acts \nthat could endanger the prospects for good-neighbourly \nrelations and will act to protect cooperation and trust \nbetween our two nations.\n\nThe Afghan Government is keen to reduce the \nnegative economic impact of the security transition and \nto move towards sustainable economic development in \nat least three ways.\n\nFirst, we will focus on the development of \nagriculture and the agribusiness sector, where more \nthan 70 per cent of our population is directly or \nindirectly engaged, with enormous potential for growth \nand employment generation.\n\nSecondly, Afghanistan is estimated to hold trillions \nof dollars worth of natural resources, including minerals \nand hydrocarbons, representing a guaranteed source of \nwealth and income for generations to come. We already \nhave several State-owned and private companies from \nChina, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, the \nUnited Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan and other countries, \nin addition to Afghan companies, expressing a keen \ninterest in investing billions of dollars.\n\nThirdly, Afghanistan is now on the eve of a \ntransformative decade, from 2015-2024, which will \nbe a multidimensional process that will have security, \npolitical and economic ramifications. Therefore, \nthe pledges made at the 2012 Tokyo and Chicago \nConferences will maintain the Afghan Government\u2019s \noverall socioeconomic efforts. Afghanistan critically \nneeds the continuation of that support from its \ninternational partners over the next few years.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s report on its progress in achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), published \nin late 2013, shows that the progress with regard to most \nof the MDG targets, in particular those related to health \nand universal primary education, is commendable. \nDespite only starting in 2005, Afghanistan is committed \nto achieving most of the MDGs by 2020. Meanwhile, \nnational consultations are under way to synchronize \nefforts towards achieving the off-track MDG targets, \nbearing in mind the outcome of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAs we embark on the important task of crafting \nthe new post-2015 development agenda at this session, \nI am happy to inform members that that process also \ncoincides with Afghanistan\u2019s transformation decade. \nBoth are top priorities for Afghanistan\u2019s national \ndevelopment agenda. We appreciate the work of the \nUnited Nations in recognizing the need to reduce \nthe number of sustainable development goals to an \naffordable, achievable and realistic number in the post-\n2015 development agenda. We are of the view that \nthat agenda should leave no one behind, it should be \nadaptable to both global and local settings, and it should \nhave sustainable development and poverty eradication \nat its centre.\n\nOur region is blessed with vast resources and \nopportunities for economic cooperation. An expanded \nlevel of regional cooperation can serve both economic and \nsecurity purposes. The Afghan Government\u2019s regional \nstrategic goal for economic cooperation is to establish \nregional economic growth and resource corridors that \nconnect the Silk Road through Afghanistan, the people \nof South and Central Asia and the Middle East and their \nkey economic activities, including agriculture, light \nmanufacturing and mineral extraction, with essential \ntrade, transit and energy enablers.\n\n\nRegional cooperation is one of our priorities. \nThe Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process represents a \nsignificant step towards enhancing stability and \nregional cooperation between Afghanistan and the \n12 participating countries, with the support of 12 other \ncountry partners and nine international organizations.\n\nThis year\u2019s General Assembly session takes place \nat a time when the United Nations has seen a number \nof conflicts continue and new ones have taken shape. \nMy Government fully supports the inalienable rights \nof the Palestinian people and the establishment of \nan independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem \nas its capital. We strongly condemn illegal actions \nand violations by the occupying Power against the \nPalestinians as a whole, especially the ongoing \ndisproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on innocent \nPalestinian civilians.\n\nWe express our grief at the killing of innocent \ncivilians in Syria and support a political resolution, \nreached through a broad-based national dialogue that \nmeets the aspirations of all Syrians. With the worsening \nsecurity situation in Iraq and Libya, we strongly \ncondemn the actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and the \nSham and its brutality, and we call for joint efforts to \ndefeat that evil. In that context, I call upon the United \nNations to take appropriate action within its mandate to \nuphold international peace and security.\n\nMy delegation believes that there is an urgent need \nfor the international community to pay attention to the \nresolution of the crisis in Ukraine, while taking into \naccount the situation of civilians.\n\nIn conclusion, let me assure members that \nAfghanistan remains committed to its national and \ninternational responsibilities and obligations. We \nreaffirm our strong will for a further strengthening of \ndemocracy and good governance, including a further \nstrengthening of the rule of law; accountability and \ntransparency; the promotion and protection of human \nrights, particularly the rights of women; justice reforms; \nthe fight against terrorism, narcotic drugs, corruption; \nand the eradication of poverty. The support of the \ninternational community is essential for all of that.\n"

        "file_text": "My statement today is \nmade on behalf of the President of the Republic of \nSuriname, His Excellency Mr. Desir\u00e9 Delano Bouterse.\n\nWe want you, Mr. President, to be assured of \nour support in these turbulent times of international \npolitics. Your task will not be easy. We pay tribute \nto your predecessor, Ambassador John Ashe, for his \nexcellent leadership during the sixty-eighth session of \nthe General Assembly.\n\nWe also want to express our support to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon in his endeavour to steer the \nUnited Nations vessel through the rough waters \nof shifting economic forces and rapidly changing \npolitical arenas, in an environment where violence \nand intolerance, whatever the root causes, seem to \nprevail. Although interdependence, self-determination \nand non-interference should be the guiding principles \nof the international community, we are faced with \nan incredible desire for domination in the name of \nundefined, so-called national interests.\n\nWe have examined some of the arguments used to \ninvade Grenada and compared those to the arguments \nused to justify the military involvement in Ukraine. \nWhat striking similarity! We have tried hard to \nunderstand the value of a referendum in the case of the \nMalvinas and the value given to the referendum held in \nCrimea.\n\nStates with media, military and economic \nvulnerabilities such as ours cannot but feel extremely \nuncomfortable with the custom-made slogans, devoid \nof any genuine moral value, that are imposed on our \nminds as precooked recipes.\n\nWe express our sincere wish that the United Nations \nshould develop the muscles needed to restructure and \ndemocratize itself and move away from restrictive \nveto powers towards inclusive legal institutions that \ncan effectively apply and monitor adherence to the \nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We see \nthat as the only way forward to achieve the ultimate \ngoal of sustainable development, even for the smallest \nmembers of the international community. The real \nproof of civilization is total respect for the seemingly \ninsignificant members of any social entity. Let us, then, \nbecome truly civilized.\n\nIn sharp contradiction to the turbulence and \nchallenges mentioned, we want to draw the attention of \nthis body to the Latin America and Caribbean region, \nwhich is, relatively speaking, a unique area of peace \nand tranquillity. It is important to answer the question: \nhow is that region showing us the way forward? From a \nmilitary point of view, it is an area of the world that is \nnuclear-free. The Treaty of Tlatelolco has proved to be \nan effective instrument to monitor and maintain Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean free from nuclear threat.\n\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that, at the \npolitical level, interdependence has become the driving \nforce of both multilateral and bilateral relations. \nSmall and large States alike interact on the basis of \nestablished treaties and principles of mutual respect, \nmutual concern and mutual benefit. The Union of South \nAmerican Nations, the Community of Latin American \nand Caribbean States and the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) in particular have played an important \nrole so far in furthering that cause.\n\nThe third, and certainly the most important, \nfactor that ensures durable peace in our region is the \nimplementation of people-oriented socioeconomic \npolicies. We have seen such programmes developed in \nBrazil, Bolivia, Chile and my own country, Suriname, \nto mention a few. The emphasis on policies and \nprogrammes related to health care, education, youth and \nsports is rapidly changing the image of Latin America \nand the Caribbean. We invite the world community to \ntake note of those positive realities in our functioning \ndemocracies, as they translate into regional integration \nprocesses with nothing less than a bright future.\n\nLooking at the positive picture at the national \nlevel, we must also address the challenges of dealing \nwith all forms of transnational organized crime in \nthe Latin American and Caribbean region. Suriname \nfully supports all initiatives deployed to face those \nchallenges.\n\nHaving said that, we must assess two areas of \nconcern that our nation faces today. Economically \nspeaking, the latest International Monetary Fund \nreport indicates that Suriname has reached an average \nper capita income of approximately $10,000. Our gross \ndomestic product (GDP) is primarily based on the \nmining sector, where gold mining and the production \nof crude oil and derivatives represent 33 per cent of our \nnational output. That sector is responsible for 90 per \ncent of our total export revenue.\n\nWe are aware of the fact that the nature of that \nsector is extractive and, as such, is subject to depletion. \nIn order to ensure the sustainability of the economy, \nthe Government has developed a policy to ensure that \nthe revenue from the non-renewable sectors is invested \nin developing human capital to ensure the full fruition \nof the capacities of the Surinamese people in their own \ninterest and the interest of the entire nation.\n\nTo ensure that that policy will materialize, \nPresident Bouterse announced, at the outset of his term, \na social contract that has been given substance in the \nfollowing programme: a legal framework guaranteeing \na minimum wage, health-care coverage for every \ncitizen and pensions for the elderly.\n\nIn the past four years, Suriname has implemented \nnew programmes to promote advanced education at \nall levels, including after-school care programmes \nfor primary and secondary students and scholarship \nprogrammes for higher education. Furthermore, legal \ninstruments are being prepared as part of a full safety \nnet to prevent dropouts.\n\nIn the same vein, various programmes have been \ndeveloped in close cooperation with other CARICOM \nStates to combat the incidence of non-communicable \ndiseases. Our ultimate goal is for those initiatives to \nbecome part and parcel of future programmes of the \nPan American Health Organization and the World \nHealth Organization.\n\nWith regard to the imminent threat of the spread \nof the Ebola virus, the Government has entered into \nclose consultations with neighbouring countries, the \nsubregion and the global community to design and \nimplement programmes to coordinate and cooperate \neffectively so as to prevent the spread of the deadly \nvirus.\n\nAs a matter of course, we can sustain those \ninitiatives only within appropriate fiscal discipline. \nWe are forced to strike the right balance between \neconomic growth, socioeconomic concerns and respect \nfor our natural environment. In doing so, Suriname has \nbeen classified as an upper-middle-income country \nwith an improved ranking in the 2013 United Nations \nDevelopment Programme Human Development Report.\n\nHowever, that classification limits our access to \nconcessional financing, which hampers our aspirations \nand endeavours to sustain the achievements I have \nmentioned. Honestly speaking, we are experiencing \nthat decision as a punishment for doing well. A \nclassification solely based on statistics, and not on our \nsocioeconomic reality, will never serve the objective of \nsustainable development based on human development. \nWe call upon the multilateral and bilateral funding \ninstitutions to adapt their policies to that approach.\n\nThere is another area of prime interest to which we \nwant to draw attention. Suriname\u2019s territory is more \nthan 90 per cent covered with forest, which annually \nabsorbs 8.8 million tons of carbon, while our annual \nemissions are 7 million tons of carbon. Suriname \n\n\n\nthus absorbs 1.8 million tons of carbon more than it \nemits on a yearly basis. While many countries work \ntowards becoming carbon-neutral, Suriname already \nqualifies as a carbon-negative country. With an annual \ndeforestation rate of 0.02 per cent and having dedicated \n13 per cent of the national territory to preserving and \nprotecting vulnerable ecosystems, we are generating a \nnational and global asset.\n\nIn stark contrast to those positive realities, \nSuriname has, paradoxically, become one of the most \nvulnerable countries in the world as a result of climate \nchange. At the recently held 2014 Climate Summit, \nSuriname indicated that sea-level rise will, inter alia, \nseverely damage or destroy our coastal ecosystems, \nincluding most of our arable land; damage or destroy \nover 40 per cent of our GDP; damage or destroy the \nhomes of over 80 per cent of our population; damage \nor destroy our world heritage-designated capital; and \nendanger the way of life of most of the people, who \nrepresent our cultural heritage and live along the coastal \nand river shores. Changes in rainfall patterns and rising \ntemperatures are already leading to increased health \nrisks and associated costs, decreased hydropower \nproduction and reduced access to river pathways.\n\nThe serious absence of international commitment \nto supporting us so that we can take the proper measures \nto avoid the impending disasters is disturbing, and \nwe have therefore been obliged to join with similar, \nvulnerable countries with strong environmentally active \nframeworks and a history of respect for ecosystems. \nWe call on the rest of the world both to become more \nproactive in support of the measures that we are \ncompelled to take, and to ensure that the relevant issues \nhave a place on the international agenda.\n\nSuriname would like to emphasize the need for a \nfundamental restructuring of the United Nations, with \nthe aim of making our Organization better equipped to \ndeal effectively with the international issues at hand. \nWe would like once again to point to the experience of \nLatin America and the Caribbean as a shining example \nof how durable peace can be achieved. In that context, \nthe economic blockade of the Cuban people should be \nconsidered to be a regional anomaly that must end now.\n\nThe role of women in achieving sustainable \ndevelopment, at the level of both civil society and \npolitical leadership, has proved an important factor in \ncreating an atmosphere of tolerance in which we choose \nto use dialogue rather than resort to violence. We must \ncontinue to encourage our women \u2014 who make up more \nthan half of the world\u2019s population \u2014 to persist in their \nstruggle for participation and inclusion and to share \nthe burden of responsibility for peace and sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nIn conclusion, Suriname is ready and willing \nto play its humble part in helping to find workable \nsolutions to the global issues at hand. We reiterate our \ncommitment to all human rights and to a policy of \ninteracting responsibly with the natural environment in \nour quest for sustained economic growth, as well as our \ncommitment to peace through dialogue.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession.\n\nI am from a region that, in my youth, lived through \nchallenging conflicts. That inspired me to go into \npublic life, which in turn has allowed me to address \nthe General Assembly in my capacity as President of \nthe Republic of Panama at a time when the world is \nenduring conflicts and very serious situations that call \nfor all of us to take action. I am speaking on behalf \nof a noble, wholesome and peaceful people, whom I \ngreet and warmly embrace from this rostrum. Panama \nis a peace-loving country that has granted me the \nopportunity to lead a Government that is steering our \ncountry to a foreign policy of unity and consensus, \nbased on our geographic location and the mandate of \nbeing a champion of peace and the common good of all \nthe inhabitants of this beautiful planet.\n\nDespite the serious conflicts raging throughout the \nworld today, America is at peace. The major challenges \nwe face today are inequality, the fight against organized \ncrime and drug and human trafficking, and the need \nto regulate migration flowing out of necessity into \ncountries with more developed economies. Those \nchallenges are being addressed by our Governments, but \nthey require further coordination. As leaders, we must \nunderstand that in order to achieve and maintain peace \nthroughout the world, we must first lead our nations \nalong the same path. This is why I am committed to \nsocial justice, to strengthening the rule of law, and to \nleading an honest, humane Government that is in touch \nwith the people and whose strength is based on the \nprinciple that public office is solely for the service of \nothers, putting our country\u2019s resources at the service of \nthe people of Panama, the region and the world.\n\nFourteen years ago, the Heads of State and of \nGovernment of the international community gathered \nin the General Assembly to approve the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), which defined a global \ndevelopment agenda to address various common \nchallenges and improve the standards of living of our \npeoples. Despite their differences of the time, countries \nwere able to agree and to reach a consensus to respect the \npriorities of each nation, focusing on the achievement \nof fundamental goals aimed at guaranteeing the human \npotential of our citizens.\n\nToday, nearly a decade and a half after that \nhistoric Declaration, all countries without exception, \nthrough different Governments, have made important \nprogress in meeting the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Nonetheless, not only have many of \nthe challenges defined in the MDGs not been met, \nbut new ones have arisen that require us to build a \nnew consensus and to establish goals at the regional, \nhemispheric and global levels. That is why, on behalf \nof the people and the Government of Panama, I would \nlike to reiterate our commitment to being a facilitator \nof dialogue that allows for bringing the international \ncommunity together anew so that we may redefine the \npost-2015 global development agenda.\n\nFor the past five centuries, the isthmus of Panama \nhas been the transit route of civilizations. Today, our \n\n\ncountry is still committed to that role. This year, as we \nmark the centennial of the Panama Canal, we reiterate \nour commitment to being a nation at the service of the \ninternational community, with the Canal, our logistic \nsystem, ports, airports and our heartfelt embrace of all \ncountries of the world.\n\nAs they do in this building, the United Nations \nHeadquarters, all the worlds\u2019 flags come together \nin the Panama Canal, and that is a source of pride \nand satisfaction for all Panamanians. It makes us \na country of convergence, and we therefore have a \ngreat responsibility to the Panamanian people and \nthe international community. Furthermore, Panama \nhas assumed the challenge of completing the Canal \nexpansion project, which we will do with firmness, \ndetermination and the support of professionals and \nworkers from Panama and various other nations.\n\nPanamanians feel a great responsibility to \ncontributing to the search for understanding in order to \nmaintain social peace, promote international security \nand join efforts towards the solution of common \nproblems that affect us. That is why we reaffirm today \nour vocation as a country of dialogue, ready to fulfil the \nresponsibility of uniting the Americas and the world \nwithin the framework of the United Nations and in every \nopportunity we have to mediate in disputes that hinder \nus from reaching agreements towards tackling the new \nglobal challenges. In April 2015, our country will host \nthe Summit of the Americas, and we are working on \nthis event that will bring together all the Heads of State \nand Government of our hemisphere in order to promote \nintegration and social peace with equity and prosperity.\n\nThe 193 countries of the world have different \npolitical systems, beliefs, religions and cultures that \nmust be respected. In spite of those differences, we \nall face common challenges. That is why, in order to \nsecure the well-being of our citizens, our Governments \nare called to find unity of criteria for strengthening \nmultilateral systems, which must be engaged with all \nthe strength of States in order to combat shared threats \nand problems.\n\nWithin conflicts and difficult situations at the global \nlevel, there are strong messages of hope \u2014 volunteer \nmedical doctors from all over the world are making \nprogress to fight Ebola in Africa, and several countries \nare united in the fight against terrorists whose atrocious \ncrimes affect innocent people and threaten international \npeace and security. Panama is aware of those efforts \nand supports them. We express our solidarity with all \nvictims and their families.\n\nI am convinced that the men and women we elect \nto public office must serve only the people who elected \nus and manage public power temporarily granted to us \nwith the purpose of improving the quality of life of our \npopulation. Politics is one of the strongest expressions \nof public service because it is the search for the common \ngood. The greatest legacy, which I will strive to build \nduring the next five years, is to leave the Panamanian \npeople a functional democracy, to strengthen the rule \nof law, where public servants are accountable only to \nthe nation, with strong institutions, accountability and \nwithout impunity, with a view to guaranteeing that \npublic administrations are honest and transparent. All \nGovernments have the obligation to ensure that State \nresources are used exclusively in the service of our \ncitizens, and that all public works and projects have the \npeople\u2019s interests in mind.\n\nCommitted to that mission and to the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals, I became President \nof my country on 1 July and formed a Government that \nwill continue to foster the economic growth enjoyed \nby Panama, while giving priority to public investment \nthat has greater impact on the quality of life of all \nPanamanians. With an average domestic economic \ngrowth of 7 per cent, increasing foreign investment, \nlegal security, low inflation and unemployment rates, \nand a consolidated democratic system, we are making \ngood on the proposals for which I was elected.\n\nDuring our mandate, we have taken strong measures \nto curb speculation in the cost of food. We are working \nto ensure that Panamanian families have adequate \nhousing with access to drinking water, basic sanitation, \nwater supply, sewage systems and treatment plants for \nwaste water and solid waste. We have launched major \nsocial projects for our youth so that they grow up in safe \nneighbourhoods with better opportunities, jobs, sports \nfacilities and cultural centres to keep them away from \ncrime.\n\nOur public schools will have adequate facilities \nand teachers trained in the English language, in order \nto promote a bilingual education. Our social welfare \nprogrammes will allow all students to finish high school \nand senior citizens to live with dignity. Our students \nwill have the opportunity to go to college or study at \nnewly established higher technical institutes that will \nprepare them for the new jobs that our economy is \ncreating in the areas of logistics and tourism, inter alia.\n\n\nOur public health system will be unified, and the \nresulting savings will be used to strengthen preventive \nhealth programmes, ensuring better medical care, and \npremium quality treatments and medication. We are \nbuilding a modern and efficient public transportation \nsystem with the new projects to add second and third \nlines to the Metro of Panama City, thereby improving \nthe quality of life of our people. We will develop tourism \nand support air connectivity to and from principal \ncities in the United States, Canada, Latin America, the \nCaribbean and Europe. We will protect our logistical \nand financial systems to prevent organized crime and \ngangs from gaining access to them, and we shall tackle \norganized crime and gangs with the full force of the \nState in order to defeat them and keep them away from \nour youth and our neighbourhoods.\n\nOur Government will work tirelessly to prepare our \nyoung people to be responsible citizens of the world \nand care for our natural resources in order to ensure \nsustainable development. We will work closely with the \nprivate sector and civil society in order to fulfil those \nnational goals, the Millennium Development Goals and \nthe new challenges of the global agenda.\n\nWe live in a diverse world, with different cultures, \nreligions and political systems, but we can always find \ncommon ground in the well-being of our citizens. That \nwas the approach that led to the successful adoption \nof the Millennium Declaration, and it will be the key \nto defining and fulfilling the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nPanama is a country that is respectful of others and \nwilling to serve as a bridge to understanding, on the \nbasis of respect for diversity, tolerance, pluralism and \nhuman rights. Above all, the Assembly can be assured \nthat Panama\u2019s Government is a Government of men and \nwomen who respect the law and are willing to share \nexperiences, learn from best practices and contribute \nto global peace, socio-economic development and the \nwell-being of all peoples.\n\nI would like to conclude by sharing a statement that \nhas been with me since my youth: \u201cThe time has come \nto put our capacity to use in service of others.\u201d May \nGod give us the strength to continue to build together a \nbetter world for our citizens and for future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "Ours is a harsh and difficult world \u2014 a complex, sometimes \ndisgraceful world where 6 million children die each \nyear before their fifth birthday, many from problems \nrelated to malnutrition; where violence has taken on a \nnew dimension of terror and horror, with hundreds of \nthousands of deaths in Libya, Syria and Iraq; and where \nhuman rights violations and crimes against humanity \noccur more frequently and with greater ferocity and are \nthe daily reality in those countries.\n\nIt is a world where more than 8 million people \ndie every year from tobacco consumption \u2014 an \nincredible genocidal activity that cannot be stopped \nand is promoted by markets that are increasingly more \nopen, free, less regulated, and licensed to operate in \ncontravention of people\u2019s rights to life and health. It is \na world where military bombs strike and kill those in \nschools, ethnic or religious minorities, or those who \nmay adhere to different political beliefs. It is a world \nwhere natural disasters devastate countries one year \nand again the following year and the next, as they have \nin the brotherly countries of the Caribbean. In this \nworld, those who act as global police have bequeathed \nsocial and political disasters wherever they have gone. \nGlobal governance has been inspired not by rights, but \nby interests. Those narrow interests were paid for with \npeople\u2019s lives, human rights violations and migration, \nin which people have had to leave their homes, cities \nand countries, vulnerable and facing anguish, violence \nand death again and again. \n\nThe United Nations has been unable to build a \nsystem to find solutions, and it has failed fundamentally \nin its ethical dimension. There has been no dearth of \nwork, documents or meetings, but there has been a lack \nof solutions for people. Our shared ethics should be \nbased on the people. Our shared ethical structure in this \ncase must be capable of incorporating our diversity, to \nfree us with democracy and participation. We need to \ngrow and develop multilateralism, which is the only \npath and basic instrument to promote that shared \nethical structure, ensuring ever more rights for ever \nmore people. We need to grow and develop in freedom.\n\nThe political and financial crises of this world are \nlinked to common values and ethical standards. Today\u2019s \nworld is one of sheer confusion in which humanitarian \ncrises follow upon political crises, which in turn follow \nupon financial, economic and social crises. Here in \nthis building we have our own microclimate; we wear \nelegant suits, eat in expensive restaurants and drive \nlarge, modern cars. What happens to people who are \nnot insiders but who suffer in refugee camps where \ntheir families are killed, their villages are destroyed \nand they are tortured, or where their environments are \ndestroyed by the effects of climate change? No one who \nhas gained a right should lose it the next day; we need to \nprotect that right. We need to offer better opportunities.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals have served \nas a useful tool to foster and channel efforts for specific \npurposes, but we should not leave countries alone in \nthose efforts. Within that framework, we should step up \nour efforts every year and seek to define more clearly \nthe sustainable development goals that will make up \nthe post-2015 sustainable development agenda in a \nbalanced, transparent and consensual way that envisions \nintegration of the three dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment: social, economic and environmental.\n\nWe should eliminate poverty from the perspective \nof human rights and the recognition of those rights. The \nwealth that comes into the world causes an increase in \nthe gross domestic product and exports and creates \nmore dynamic investment, all of which must be \naccompanied by a logical recognition of rights. We are \nmore developed and richer when we have more rights to \nexercise, when those rights are protected, and when we \nhave more guarantees against the growing inequalities \nin the world. Poverty is experienced at many levels, \n\nand each country is responsible for granting ever more \nrights to help its people overcome poverty, improve \nconditions and eliminate discrimination. \n\nAll efforts are valuable in every one of our countries, \nand as is every non-governmental organization that \ncharts the way or denounces an abuse of human rights \nor seeks to improve opportunities for women, children, \nyouths, retired people and migrants in different areas, \nsuch as health care, education, social protection, decent \nwork, social and economic opportunities, whether they \nare employed as rural or domestic workers. In every \nindividual there is an enormous potential that needs to \nbe protected and fostered. \n\nThe gender perspective that we need to promote \nshould also be aligned with key rights for every \nindividual who may suffer from even a little bit of \ndiscrimination in this world. The women\u2019s agenda is one \nof the most powerful vectors for development that we \ncan design. Any type of discrimination involves some \nform of underdevelopment, because discrimination \nbased on gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual \norientation or migratory status is contrary to what our \nsocieties need. \n\nOur societies must be more inclusive. Our \nsocieties should incorporate every single one of those \nrights into our political system and legal protections, \nwhether they relate to the right of same-sex marriage, \nthe right of those who cohabit, or the rights of those \nwith HIV. It is essential to fight for equality and to \neliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity. All rights are part of the best social \nstructure \u2014 love. Love is the essential factor that \neliminates inequality and discrimination, that makes us \nall equal and that allows us to identify with our fellow \nhuman beings.\n\nThe comprehensive human rights agenda must \nbe based on an increasing number of rights for an \nincreasing number of people so that everyone is able \nto grow in freedom and equality. We need to continue \nto make definitive progress on social topics such as \ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases. That \nincludes those related to tobacco consumption, from \nwhich, as I mentioned, over 8 million people die every \nyear. It is expected that that figure will continue to rise. \nIt is therefore crucial that we have national policies that \nfocus on healthy lifestyles.\n\nIn 2013, Uruguay legalized the sale of cannabis, \nchoosing an alternative regulatory model to combat drug \ntrafficking and its disastrous consequences in society. \nWe do not claim to be an example or a trailblazer, but \nwe do, obviously, want to redesign the kinds of policies \nthat have categorically failed to date and that have not \nproduced the expected results.\n\nThe critical situation in the world today with \nrespect to food security is a structural problem. It is \nthe result of bad global policies. One of every eight \npeople, many of them children, suffer from chronic \nmalnutrition. Humankind wastes more than a third of \nall the food we produce, which would be enough to \nresolve the problem of hunger. It is estimated that 30 \nto 50 per cent of the food produced every year is never \nconsumed by people, and the situation is worsening due \nto soil erosion, growing water scarcity, climate change \nand the improper use of toxic substances in the food \nproduction chain.\n\nCombating climate change is a top priority. The \nneed to implement policies today and not put them \noff until tomorrow is the moral imperative of every \nsingle individual in this Hall, so that we can give \nconcrete content to the sustainable development goals \nand continue to grow. It is also important to continue \nto develop civil and political society, which we must \nsupport. The principle of the legal equality of States is \nessential. That is why my country rejects, for example, \nany coercive, unilateral or extraterritorial measures \nthat contravene the norms of international law and the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. The \nclearest example of that is the unjust blockade imposed \nagainst Cuba. We would like to once again express \nour strongest rejection of it. Uruguay would like to \nunequivocally demand that Cuba be stricken from the \nlist of countries who harbour terrorists.\n\nIn the same vein, Uruguay would like to call for an \nend to be put to financial speculation by vulture funds. \nIt is important that countries be able to restructure \ntheir sovereign debt in predictable, unchanging and just \nconditions without impacting development and, thus, \nthe well-being of their people.\n\nGlobal peace and security are essential. The \neradication of any form of violence in this world is a \ncrucial issue. It is essential to have negotiated solutions \nthat parties agree on, and contributions by peacekeeping \nmissions are essential to providing maximal guarantees \nin the world.\n\nHuman rights should be fully respected. They \nshould be fully monitored, and guarantees should \n\nbe provided in that regard to every individual. The \nauthorities should ensure that human rights are fully \nmonitored to ensure that their people enjoy the broadest \npossible freedoms.\n\nUruguay deplores violence in all its forms. The \nsubstance of violence is bad at its core. There is no \njustification for violence to continue to spread in the \nworld today. Every time one right is undermined, it \nis our responsibility, as those who govern, to lead \nthe fight for its restoration. Every time justice is not \nrendered, it must be our mission, as leaders, to demand \naccountability. Every time we recognize a new right, \nit is our obligation to remember those who still cannot \nexercise that right and to work tirelessly for their \nbenefit.\n"

In the light of the wisdom and \nexperience of its 69 years, our Organization must find \nfresh strength and vitality and renew its commitment to \na world continually faced with challenges and threats \nthat change and become more unpredictable with each \npassing day.\n\nThe current session also provides us with an \nimportant opportunity to carry out a comprehensive \nassessment of our Organization\u2019s work and undertake \nthe preparations to ensure that 2015 will be the year \nof reform, on the occasion of our seventieth birthday. \nClearly, as part of that process, we should take greater \naccount, first, of new complications, such as those related \nto the extreme vulnerability of small island developing \nStates, in accordance with the recommendations of the \nrecent Third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, held in Apia. Secondly, we should \nwork to ensure better representation for developing \ncountries, particularly those in Africa, which today \nincludes not only areas that are seeing significant \neconomic growth but also some that are afflicted by \ngreat poverty and often bloody conflicts that slow \ntheir development and are an obstacle to their peoples\u2019 \nwelfare.\n\nMeanwhile, it is vital that the long-hoped-for reform \nof our Organization include ensuring that the Security \nCouncil takes on the role of coordinator in the fight \nagainst the new global scourge of terrorism. In any \nevent, as a country committed to and involved in the \nEast African Standby Force, the Union of the Comoros \nfully appreciates the Security Council\u2019s responsibilities \nin helping to promote, guide and supervise the \nprevention and resolution of conflicts in Central Africa, \nNigeria and Mali, as well as Libya, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine \nand any country in crisis. All are sources of tension \nthat undermine peace in various parts of the world and \nhave become fertile breeding grounds for international \nterrorism. It is in that context, and especially in the \nwake of the recent and bloody armed attacks on our \nPalestinian brothers in Gaza, that I would like to stress \nthe urgent need for a just and immediate solution to the \nquestion of Palestine, which, sadly, is almost as old as \nour Organization.\n\nIn order to maintain and build peace in a constantly \nchanging world, we must focus unfailingly on conflict \nprevention, while continuing to support efforts to \nsolve crises as they arise. Our community of nations \nhas a duty to take the initiative on issues that may ruin \nour Organization\u2019s credibility if not dealt with fairly. \nThat is the case with my country, which, admitted \nas a Member of the United Nations under resolution \n3385 (XXX), of 12 November 1975, in affirmation of \nthe importance of respecting the unity and territorial \nintegrity of the Comoro Archipelago, consisting of four \nislands, still awaits the completion of its decolonization \nprocess. In that regard, in my address to the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session (see A/68/PV.10), I \ndiscussed our new approach to reaching an agreement \nwith France on a fair solution that is consistent with the \nprinciples governing our Organization.\n\nIn keeping with the commitment I expressed from \nthis rostrum, I would like to inform the Assembly that \nthe high joint council proposed by the Paris Declaration \nhas been established. This monitoring body began its \nwork in November 2013 and is preparing to meet again \nat the end of this year. At its second meeting, the issues \nit will address will include that of people\u2019s movement \nbetween the archipelago\u2019s four islands, in an effort \nto end the tragedies that afflict Comorian families \ndaily \u2014 tragedies that generally go unnoticed by \ninternational public opinion but are deeply damaging \nto my people\u2019s collective consciousness. These are \ntragedies that are equally troublesome to the conscience \nof France, the great country whose humanistic values \nwe share.\n\nIn other words, quite apart from the two countries\u2019 \nterritorial dispute, it is extremely urgent that we end \nthis human tragedy through a peaceful and committed \ndialogue between the two parties, which can only \nbenefit from United Nations support. That is why, \nin the spirit of the Paris Declaration and to pave the \nway for building a renewed relationship focused on \nthe future, I recently sought the support of the Indian \nOcean Commission at the fourth summit for Heads of \nState and Government of that subregional organization, \nof which France and the Comoros are both members. \n\nThere, the Comorian Government put the emphasis \non a spirit of harmony aimed at preserving the bonds \nbetween our peoples, while reaffirming the importance \nof respecting the principles of international law in \nsettling this 40-year dispute.\n\nThe purpose of the Assembly\u2019s sixty-ninth session \nis to define a development programme for the post-\n2015 period, with, as its chief aims, the eradication \nof poverty and hunger and the promotion of inclusive \nand sustainable economic growth throughout the \nworld. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nunquestionably created a global covenant of solidarity \nfor our nation\u2019s socioeconomic progress. Like many \ncountries, and like small island developing States \nin particular, the Union of the Comoros has made \nsignificant strides towards achieving the Goals, \nincluding improving maternal health and women\u2019s \nparticipation in political and economic life, reducing \nmalaria and infant mortality, fighting HIV/AIDS and \nensuring equality in children\u2019s education. However, \nthere is still much to do, particularly in the areas of \nfood security, access to universal health care and the \ndeterioration of the environment. Similarly, energy, \nsustainable agriculture and access to drinking water \nfor much of the population are still matters for concern.\n\nThat is why, at a time when my country is \nnegotiating entry into the World Trade Organization, \nwe urge that the MDGs that have still not been reached \nbe incorporated into our new sustainable development \ngoals. We also call for strengthened strategic \npartnerships for development, the establishment of an \nequitable regime for international trade, the promotion \nof domestic and foreign direct investment and, lastly, \ngreater mobilization and commitment in combating \nclimate change. It is also vital to implement promptly \nthe recommendations of the various climate summits, \nespecially the Samoa Conference and the Climate \nSummit held here in New York on 23 September.\n\nMany indicators over the past few years, such as the \nrate of economic growth in various African countries, \ngive reason to hope for a better future for development \non our continent. However, Africa is having to deal \nwith challenges related to conflict resolution and \nmultiple threats to peace and security that no country \nin the world can manage alone, without international \ncooperation and support. One example is Ebola, a virus \nthat is devastating various West African countries, the \nalarming scale and speed of whose spread represent a \nglobal threat. We welcome the steps that many countries \nhave taken recently to help contain and eradicate this \nepidemic.\n\nIt is on my belief in the crucial importance of \ninternational solidarity in meeting our peoples\u2019 \never-growing needs that I base my hopes of seeing \nour Organization successfully negotiate its own \ntransformation after almost 70 years of existence. \nIndeed, it is by rising to meet the many current \nchallenges and fully assuming the demands of an \nincreasingly interdependent and complex world that we \nwill be able together to open up ways of hope for future \ngenerations.\n"

        "file_text": "We gather this week to reaffirm our commitment to \npeace, justice and development. Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines proudly recognizes Mr. John Ashe, son \nof our Caribbean soil and President of the General \nAssembly at the sixty-eighth session, and commends \nhim for his invaluable contribution in advancing the \ninternational agenda during his superlative tenure. We \njoyously welcome the current President as our new \nstandard-bearer. As part of the African diaspora, we \ncelebrate with the continent of Africa in claiming him \nas one of our own, and in investing the same faith and \nconfidence in him in this role as do the people of his \nnative Uganda.\n\nFifteen years into the twenty-first century, the \nchallenges of our times have caused some nations \nto question the value or role of sovereignty in an \nincreasingly borderless world. Globalization and \nmodernity have unleashed a number of forces that \noperate independently of national Governments or \nborders. They include the ills of climate change; \ncommunicable diseases such as Ebola; and economic \ncontagion that spreads like wildfire as external shocks \nthat pose serious developmental and existential threats \nbeyond the scope of individual States to address. \nGroups have emerged \u2014 from terrorists to drug cartels \nto certain rapacious multinationals \u2014 that span the \nglobe and exploit systemic weaknesses to further their \nown nefarious self-interest.\n\nThe pressures of keeping pace in an interconnected \nworld have prompted suggestions that we can no longer \nrely on a traditional rulebook that does not specifically \ncontemplate our modern challenges. Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines emphatically rejects this suggestion. \nThe rulebook that governs our international cooperation \nis the Charter of the United Nations, and its principal \ngolden rule is that of respect for the sovereign equality \nof all States.\n\nTo be sure, certain administrative aspects of our \nrulebook \u2014 for example, the composition and working \nmethods of our fossilized and increasingly irrelevant \nSecurity Council \u2014 are clearly long overdue for \nmeaningful reform. However, the principles that inform \nour Charter and undergird the Assembly are timeless. \nAny attempt to deviate from the Charter in word, deed \nor spirit would constitute an assault on sovereignty, a \ndeparture from diplomacy, and the improvisation of \ninternational law on the fly.\n\nThe loss of sovereignty has never benefited the \nweak or powerless. The erosion of sovereignty has \nnever restrained the interests of the powerful. The list \nof nations whose sovereignty has been violated in the \ninterest of great Power convenience grows inexorably \nlonger, while the tally of those whose populations are \ndemonstrably better off for such violations remains \ntragically short. Accordingly, Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines rejects the choice between modern \ninterconnectivity and traditional sovereignty as false \nand intended to accelerate a global slide into lawless \nunilateralism.\n\nAs upholders of and adherents to international law, \nwe continue to struggle in search of common themes \nto help us understand which coup d\u2019\u00e9tat is legal and \nwhich is not; which foreign intervention is just and \nwhich is criminal; which particular sovereignty or \nterritorial integrity is worth fighting for, and which \nshould be conveniently disregarded and swept under \nthe rug of endless, impotent debate; which national \nborder constitutes a barrier, and which represents an \ninvitation; which World Trade Organization decision \nwill be enforced to the detriment of the weak, and \nwhich, as in the case of our Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) neighbour Antigua and Barbuda, will be \nignored by the guilty but powerful party. As a small, \nopen, vulnerable State, we cannot accept the suggestion \nthat our existence rests on the whim, generosity or \nbenign neglect of powerful States. International law \nand sovereign equality are the bulwarks against the \ntype of naked aggression and unilateralism that have \ntoo often led our nations to the precipice of war.\n\nThe cancer of terrorism continues to spread. The \nworld has witnessed the celebration of savagery and \nthe multiplication of misery by those who sow death \nand hatred in the name of religion. Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines, like every other civilized nation, \nis outraged at the global rise of militant groups that \ncommit unspeakable acts of mass violence in their \nquest to enforce a brutal and indefensible social order.\n\nHowever, the fact that terrorists disregard national \nborders and sovereignty is no excuse for us to do the \nsame. We must not stoop to their level by neglecting \nthe bedrock principles of the peaceful coexistence \nof nations. Nor must we ever repeat the mistake of \nbelieving that terrorism is a force that can be harnessed \nor supported to further some greater political objective. \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot accept that \nthe difference between noble rebel and evil terrorist \n\ncan hinge on something as arbitrary as on which side of \na border they decide to perform their rapes, beheadings \nand bombings. We unequivocally support genuine \nefforts targeted at eliminating this scourge, and we \ncall for global solidarity and international cooperation \nin this urgent cause. Politics may make for strange \nbedfellows, but in a civilized world, humanity must \nalways trump ideology in the fight against murderous \nbarbarism.\n\nThe political manipulation of the term \u201cterrorist\u201d \nthreatens our shared resolve to eliminate its growing \nmenace. Nowhere is this manipulation more glaringly \nobjectionable than in the false designation by the United \nStates of the Republic of Cuba as a State sponsor of \nterrorism. Cuba has been a victim of State terrorism, a \ncondemner of State terrorism and a collaborator in the \nfight against State terrorism. Meanwhile, other actors \nnakedly support and lavishly fund the most despicable \nterrorist groups, without so much as a hint of public \nreproach. It is hard to imagine why the United States, \na firm, honourable and unquestioned global leader \nin the fight against terrorism, and the target of the \nmost heinous attacks, would want to distract itself, \nor its allies, from the fight at hand by maintaining its \nunfounded characterization of Cuba.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines reiterates the \ncall of the overwhelming majority of States for an \nimmediate end to the illegal economic, commercial \nand financial embargo against Cuba. The external \nprojection of political self-interest is not a sovereign \nexercise, but a retrograde and anachronistic attack on \nthe very principles that undergird the Organization. \nThe United States is a far greater nation than this petty, \npunitive and illegal embargo suggests. We encourage it \nto demonstrate the courage to cast aside this Cold War \nrelic.\n\nWe are one month removed from the disastrous \nconsequences of yet another violent conflict between \ncombatants in Israel and the State of Palestine. \nThousands are dead and thousands more were \nwounded \u2014 the overwhelming majority of whom \nwere Palestinian civilians. Whatever the motivations \nfor that particular conflict, no one can doubt that \nthe underlying problem remains unaddressed and \nunresolved. At its root is the invasion, occupation and \neconomic strangulation of Palestine, and the steady, \nillegal erosion of its internationally established borders.\n\nDespite regrettable actions on both sides of this \ndispute, no amount of political relativism can apportion \nblame equally between occupier and occupied. The \nunquestionable right of Israel to exist in peace and \ndefend itself does not and cannot give it unfettered \nlicence to occupy, oppress and suppress the sovereign \nrights of the Palestinian people. Israel is a powerful, \naccomplished, democratic nation with powerful \nfriends. It diminishes itself and the status of its allies \nby its unchallenged actions in Palestine. Once again, \nthe absence of borders and the disregard of sovereignty \nthreaten to make the concept of a two-State solution \nnothing more than feel-good rhetoric with limited \napplicability on the ground.\n\nA great Caribbean artist, Peter Tosh, once lamented \nin song that while \u201ceveryone is crying out for peace, \nnone are crying out for justice\u201d. Peace cannot be \nassumed in the absence of war, nor can it be established \nin the absence of justice. This Assembly owes the \npeople of Palestine its attention and action in the long- \noverdue quest for real peace and statehood.\n\nClimate change does not respect national \nborders \u2014 a fact known all too well in Saint Vincent \nand the Grenadines. Despite a tiny carbon footprint and \nminuscule emissions, our country has nonetheless been \nrepeatedly victimized by weather anomalies partially \ncaused by the historical and continued environmental \nabuse of major emitters. In the past four years, \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has experienced \na hurricane, a drought and two floods. The loss and \ndamage caused by each of those events has resulted \nin annual double-digit hits to our gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). Last December, in a mere three hours \nof unseasonal rainfall, 17 per cent of our GDP was \nwashed away in flash flooding. Our sister islands of \nGrenada and Dominica were similarly affected. Lives \nand livelihoods were lost, homes and infrastructure \nwere destroyed, and a developmental hole was dug from \nwhich it will take years to emerge.\n\nYet, despite the gathering and intensifying global \nthreat of climate change, with its real and ruinous \npresent-day impacts, historical and major emitters \ncontinue to act as if the planet had time on its side. \nThe excuses offered for continued inaction, whether \npolitical, historical, scientific or economic, grow \nincreasingly indefensible. The prospects of genuine \nprogress against climate change become increasingly \nremote with each passing day of diplomatic dithering, \nbuck-passing and finger-pointing.\n\nLast week, the Secretary-General convened a \nhigh-level Climate Summit here at United Nations \n\nHeadquarters in an admirable attempt to galvanize \npolitical will for an ambitious and legally binding climate \ntreaty by 2015. However, the tangible results were less \nthan encouraging. Despite some welcome new pledges, \nthe numbers simply do not add up to anything close to \nwhat is required to cap global warming at 1.5\u00b0C above \npre-industrial levels. Furthermore, the new resources \nraised and pledged for the financing of adaptation to \nclimate change were a drop in the bucket \u2014 akin to \nhaving a bake sale to settle the national debt.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is fearful that \nthe legally binding agreement, which we are scheduled \nto enact next year, will be insufficiently ambitious to \nsolve our looming climate crisis, and that adaptation \nfinancing will be woefully short of what is truly required. \nIf narrow interests and local electoral cowardice force \nus to retreat behind our national borders and bury our \nheads in the sand, we may squander a decade of effort \nand our only real chance to save the planet on which we \nlive. The stakes are that high. We cannot afford to fail.\n\nIt is appropriate that the President of the General \nAssembly will preside over the launch of the \nInternational Decade of People of African Descent, \nwhich runs from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2024. \nThe theme of that Decade will be \u201cPeople of African \ndescent: recognition, justice and development\u201d. The \nmeaningful and action-oriented implementation of \nthis theme can have far-reaching positive effects on \nthe African continent and among its far-flung diaspora \nalike.\n\nOne element of recognition, justice and development \nthat will be of central importance to Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines and the wider Caribbean Community \nis the advancement of our claims for reparatory justice \nfrom the European colonizing Powers that engaged in \nnative genocide, the transatlantic slave trade and the \nprolonged system of chattel slavery itself. Over the past \nyear, CARICOM Heads of State and Government have \nunanimously approved a series of policies, structures \nand initiatives aimed at educating our populations \nand engaging former slave-holding and slave-trading \nnations in a conversation about reparatory justice. The \nlevel of priority that CARICOM Governments accord to \nthe issue of reparatory justice cannot be overstated. At \nthe historical root of our region\u2019s many developmental \nimpediments is an enduring legacy of slavery, which \nis the unchanging millstone that we have been forced \nto carry uphill for generations. We seek the support of \nthe international community in furthering our just and \ntimely cause.\n\nSimilarly, in a region still grappling with the \naftereffects of systematic discrimination, victimization \nand human rights violations under the cover of unjust \nlaw, we cannot countenance the re-emergence of \njudicially sanctioned bigotry within our Caribbean \ncivilization. The application of the year-old decision \nof the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic \ncontinues to retroactively deny thousands of Dominican-\nborn citizens of their rights to nationality, identity \nand equal protection. The unanimous international \ncondemnation of the decision has led to welcome and \nincreased political interaction between Haiti and the \nDominican Republic on a host of bilateral issues. We \nhold out every hope that those discussions between \nneighbours will benefit both countries.\n\nHowever, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the \nwider CARICOM remain outraged at the core human \nrights violations that have not been corrected and cannot \nbe resolved by bilateral t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. We are beyond the \npoint where continuing human rights violations can \nbe masked behind seemingly benign bureaucracy. \nWe call on the international community to assist our \nbrothers in the Dominican Republic in reinstating the \nconstitutional and human rights of those Dominicans \nwho have been so wrongly stripped of their citizenship \nand dignity.\n\nLast year, from this rostrum, Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines called on the United Nations to accept its \nrole and offer recompense to the victims of the cholera \noutbreak in Haiti, it having been established that United \nNations peacekeepers brought the cholera with them to \nHaiti (see A/68/PV.16). A year later, the United Nations \ncontinues to dodge its moral and ethical responsibility. \nThe legitimacy of the Organization to conduct future \npeacekeeping missions and the legacy of its leadership \nat the highest levels will be irreparably damaged by any \nfailure to immediately redress this glaring wrong.\n\nThe prestige and legitimacy of the United Nations \ncan be further enhanced through further acceptance \nof the reasonable calls for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful \nparticipation in the specialized agencies of the United \nNations. Taiwan already participates actively and \nconstructively in many critical international bodies. \nMy country and several others in the Caribbean and \nCentral America bear testimony to Taiwan\u2019s principled \nconduct of its intergovernmental relations. Surely the \n\n\ntime has now come for this exemplar of the magnificent \nChinese civilization to be permitted to participate in \nthe work of various agencies of this world body.\n\nThe chosen theme for this general debate \u2014 \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d \u2014 reflects a wise focus on a \ncentral priority and core strength of this institution. The \nexercise and advancement of the right to development is \nan overarching priority for the overwhelming majority \nof the world\u2019s peoples, and it is the absence of sufficient \ndevelopmental progress that is often the root cause of a \ngreat deal of global violence and unrest.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda must coalesce \naround a series of goals and targets that offer a \npeople-centred path of progress for developing \ncountries. In elaborating that agenda, and in this, \nthe International Year of Small Island Developing \nStates (SIDS), it is critical that the vulnerabilities and \nunique characteristics of SIDS inform that document. \nThe recently agreed Small Island Developing States \nAccelerated Modalities of Action (A/CONF.223/3, \nannex), which emerged from the historic Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, must constitute a foundational input in shaping \nthe development agenda in areas such as concessional \nfinancing for development, inequality, poverty \nalleviation, debt relief, disaster-risk reduction, oceans \nmanagement and education.\n\nIn that regard, we consider it vital that the post-\n2015 goals and indicators focus equally on targets \nwithin developing countries and measurable, timely \ncommitments from development partners. A major \nshortcoming of the Millennium Development Goals \nhas been the nebulous nature of the so-called global \npartnership for development. Let us anchor our \nshared future ambitions in concrete, measurable and \npredictable action.\n\nCivilized Governments and peoples must respect \nborders and sovereignty even if some of the forces \nunleashed by globalization and modernity do not. Let \nus build on what is right, good and proper in our new \ninterconnected world and cast away not the rulebook \nbut the excuses for disregarding its time-honoured \nrules.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines celebrates the \ngood of a world in which every student of Saint Vincent \nand the Grenadines can browse the stacks of an American \nlibrary using his or her own Taiwanese computer \nthat was assembled in China. It welcomes a business \nenvironment where we can rely on the support of an \nAmerican non-governmental organization in engaging \nan Icelandic company and its Canadian counterpart \nin harnessing our national geothermal resources and \npropelling us towards 100 per cent renewable energy. We \ncelebrate an international solidarity in which brotherly \nnations offer support in our time of need after a natural \ndisaster, and engineers and architects convene on our \nshores to help us rebuild. We welcome technology that \nallows us the opportunity to communicate, celebrate \nor commiserate with our migrant diaspora in real time \nand affords them the opportunity to send remittances \nto their families at home from every corner of the \nglobe. We value an international order that allows \na tiny State to disagree respectfully with a large one \nwithout fear of unjust repercussions. We revel in \nregional integration arrangements, like the Caribbean \nCommunity, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas \nand the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \nStates, where sovereignty is respected and often pooled, \nin furthering a cooperative, people-centred vision for \ngrowth and development.\n\nThose are not dreams but modern realities in our \ncountry today. They demonstrate the paths of peaceful \ncoexistence and development that are possible when \nsovereignty is enhanced, not eroded. Any nation can \nlike or dislike another nation, approve or disapprove of \nits decisions, admonish or praise its actions, befriend \nor avoid its Governments. Those are sovereign rights. \nBut every nation is obliged to respect its counterpart\u2019s \nequal and unfettered right to exist, act and determine \nits own political destiny and development path.\n\nThe challenge of the twenty-first century is the \nobsolescence, not of the rulebook, but of the outmoded \nplaybook of cynical strategies, tactics and inconsistent \napplication of international law by those who see it as \na tool to further their goals, rather than a restraint on \nhegemonic geopolitical ambition. Sovereignty is not the \nright to erect a wall of repression or injustice around \nnational borders. Nor is it the right to protect and \nproject national interests to the detriment of another. It \nis neither sword nor shield. It is, instead, a responsibility \nto adhere to an ethic of reciprocity \u2014 to do unto other \nnations only what one\u2019s own nation would accept being \ndone unto itself."

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nMr. Kutesa on assuming the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are indeed \nproud of the honour that has been bestowed upon the \nAfrican continent as a result of his election. The theme \nhe has chosen for this session, that is, \u201cDelivering \non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda\u201d, is pertinent, appropriate and \ntimely. It is relevant in our efforts to achieve a seamless \ntransition from the Millennium Development Goals to \nthe sustainable development goals and the broader post-\n2015 development agenda. We look forward to having a \ncandid and comprehensive debate on the challenges we \ncontinue to face at the domestic and international levels \nin our efforts to eradicate poverty.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nhelped to focus and mobilize global development \nefforts in order to achieve progress in the social sectors. \nHowever, despite the significant achievements within \nthe framework of the MDGs, progress was uneven \nbetween goals, among regions and within countries. \nConsequently, we cannot remain complacent when some \nsections of the global community are marginalized or \neven left behind. We are therefore gratified that the \nproposed sustainable development goals have taken \non board the unfinished business of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Part of that unfinished business \nconcerns the critical issue of poverty eradication, which \nremains the greatest global challenge. That issue should \n\ntherefore be the top priority and overarching objective \nof the development agenda for the future.\n\nWe in the Southern African Development \nCommunity share the view that the post-MDG agenda \nmust be informed by national development priorities and \nthat the new targets must better reflect local conditions. \nIn that regard, Zimbabwe adopted its own economic \nblueprint, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-\nEconomic Transformation. It is a bold and achievable \ndevelopment programme that has the objective of \nensuring inclusive economic growth, decent jobs \nfor all, affordable and reliable energy, food security, \nsustainable agriculture and the development of reliable \nmodern infrastructure. Through the programme, we \nalso aim to expand the industrial base, which is key to \nthe sustained overall economic development and human \ndevelopment of our country. We continue to push for \nthe leveraging of our diverse and abundant resources \nthrough beneficiation and value addition. We therefore \nexpect that the proposals in the sustainable development \ngoals, which complement those elements of our national \naspirations, will be endorsed and integrated into the \npost-2015 development agenda framework.\n\nSocial justice, political stability and sustainable \ndevelopment in African countries can best be achieved \nthrough genuine and committed support for the \nownership of means of production that favour the poor, \nwho are in the majority. In Zimbabwe, my Government \nhas gone a long way in laying the foundation for \nsustained food production through our land reform \nprogramme. The majority of the rural people have been \nempowered to contribute to household and national \nfood security. The possession and exploitation of land \nhas also turned them into masters of their own destiny, \nthus giving true meaning to our national independence \nand unquestioned sovereignty.\n\nBecause Zimbabwe has thus been preoccupied with \nthe empowerment of its people economically, it has \nbecome a victim of the evil machinations of Western \ncountries, namely, the United States and States members \nof the European Union, which continue to apply \nunilateral and illegal sanctions as a foreign-policy tool \nto achieve short-term political objectives, particularly \nregime change. Regime change is a diabolical and \nillegal policy of interference in the domestic affairs of \nmy country, and no good can come from undermining \nour economy or depriving our citizens of the necessities \nof life. Why, I ask, should Zimbabweans continue to \nsuffer under the American and European yoke of \nunjustified and unwarranted illegal sanctions? Those \nevil sanctions violate the fundamental principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations and should be condemned \nby the international community. We once again call for \ntheir immediate and unconditional removal.\n\nWe are a peaceful and peace-loving nation, ready to \nengage in constructive dialogue for mutually beneficial \nrelations. We call on those who continue to harbour \nill will against us to cast away their hegemony-driven \nhostility, as we appeal to them to review their hard-\nline and cruel positions and open a new chapter in their \nrelations with us based on mutual respect and friendly \ncooperation.\n\nTo support the implementation of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, we call for an expeditious reform \nof the Bretton Woods institutions, particularly their \ngovernance structures. It is high time that we addressed \nthe democratic deficit in those institutions and improved \ntheir legitimacy. Those reforms must reflect current \nrealities and ensure the full voice and participation of \ndeveloping countries in the decision-making and norm-\nsetting activities.\n\nZimbabwe firmly believes that the United Nations \nshould promote dialogue to achieve peace, the rule of \nlaw and common understanding among States. The \npeace, security, stability and welfare of Africa and our \nsubregion is vital for us. In Africa, the African Union is \nworking tirelessly to push for peace in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, South Sudan, the Central African \nRepublic and Somalia. The international community \nmust remain intensively engaged and support Africa \nin the maintenance of peace and stability, thereby \nenhancing its peacekeeping-capacity needs through \ntraining and logistical and financial support. Africa also \nremains seized of the issue of Western Sahara, the last \ncolonial vestige in Africa. The United Nations should \nnot shake off its responsibility to ensure the realization \nof self-determination by the people of Western Sahara.\n\nWe continue to witness the suffering and persecution \nof the people of Palestine at the hands of Israel. We have \nwitnessed the callous murder of women and children in \nshelters, where they seek refuge from Israel\u2019s bombs. \nWe have witnessed the brutal and random destruction \nof infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. While those heinous \nacts were being perpetrated by Israel, the so-called \ncivilized world maintained a deafening silence. And we \nask, why?\n\nLasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved \nonly through a two-State solution based on the 1967 \nborders. Any other manoeuvres to change demographic \nrealities through settlements or the use of force will \nonly prolong the suffering of the Palestinians.\n\nIn conclusion, as we move forward, it is important \nto muster the necessary political will to create a \ndevelopment-oriented international environment that \nfacilitates the eradication of poverty and enhances \nthe sound management of our natural resources for \neconomic and social development, under a renewed and \nreal global partnership.\n"

        "file_text": "I extend our sincere \ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \nsession. We see him undertaking that onerous task \nat a particularly important moment in not only the \nforging of the future global development agenda, but \nthe development of international peace and security. I \ntherefore assure him of my Government\u2019s support as \nhe sets out to discharge that important assignment. In \nthe same spirit, I also convey our appreciation for the \ncontribution made by his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\n\nI wish to highlight our deep concern at the global \nhealth emergency that has resulted from the Ebola \noutbreak in parts of Africa. That burden is not only \nfor the people of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea; \nZambia views the epidemic as a common challenge \nto humankind, and therefore stands ready to support \nall efforts required to defeat the disease and ensure a \nreturn to normalcy in the daily economic and social \nlives of our sister Republics that are directly facing the \ndisease.\n\nThere is growing acceptance and concern that \nEbola could easily spread beyond the first four \ncountries that have so far borne the brunt of the \ndisease. The recent resurgence of the disease in the \nneighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo is a \nreminder of the extent of the danger. Beyond that, we \nremain deeply concerned that over 5,000 people in all \nhave been victims of the disease and 2,400 needless \ndeaths have already been recorded across the continent. \nZambia therefore supports the call for greater and wider \ninvolvement by all Member States. The World Health \nOrganization has already warned that if the epidemic \nis left unchecked, we will soon be dealing with over \n20,000 Ebola patients.\n\nIt is equally for that reason that we continue to look \nat global health issues as important parameters for global \ndevelopment. The Ebola public health emergency and \nother ongoing challenges, such as malaria, tuberculosis, \nAIDS and other, non-communicable diseases, need a \nconcerted global approach.\n\nIn the past few months, the international community \nhas witnessed the growing desperation of extremist \nterrorist organizations, notably through the abduction \nof innocent schoolgirls in Borno state, Nigeria, and the \nwider reign of terror, which includes bombing civilian \ntrading points across that important African nation.\n\nZambia is also concerned about the insecurity \ncurrently being experienced as a result of the instability \nin Ukraine. We have followed the counter-accusations, \nwhich point to the deep-seated divisions and suspicions \nof a bygone era. Sadly, the human losses have been \nheavy, as ordinary Ukrainians are caught in the middle \nof a crisis that is strongly influenced by foreign factors. \nInnocent civilians from other nations have also been \ndrawn in through the loss of lives on Malaysia Airlines \nFlight MH-17. We share in the sorrow of the families \nand the nations that lost loved ones in that human-\ncaused catastrophe. Zambia believes that ordinary \nUkrainian citizens are of the same view and desire \nnothing but peace, harmony and prosperity for their \ncountry. They should be allowed to enjoy those basic \nhuman conditions.\n\nThose and other global security concerns linger, \nfacing a United Nations that is becoming ever more \nchallenged in coordinating any robust or convincing \nglobal response.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly is also \ntaking place at a moment of renewed focus on the \nglobal development agenda through the negotiations \non the post-2015 agenda and the work to produce \nthe sustainable development goals (SDGs). My \nunderstanding has been that the negotiations have thus \nfar been engaging and have included the participation of \nall stakeholders, including Governments, civil society, \nthe business community and academia. It can therefore \nbe said that we have laid a solid foundation upon which \nthe world will articulate its development policies for the \nnext decade and a half, in line with the three pillars of \nthe SDGs.\n\nWe look forward to the completion of those \ndeliberations, knowing that unless the means of \nimplementation are adequately covered with new \ninvestment inflows, we risk rendering that noble effort \na futile exercise. Given the immense challenges facing \nour nations, it is such multilateral approaches that will \naddress the underlying cross-border factors that affect \nclimate change, global poverty, public health, children\u2019s \nwelfare, labour and migration, youth unemployment, the \nadvancement of women and many other issues whose \nsolutions lie in actions that may have transboundary \neffects.\n\nThe new global development regime must therefore \ndemonstrate a new and more robust approach to \nthose problems. For that reason, Zambia supports the \nrelated meetings being held alongside this session of \nthe Assembly, notably those relating to population and \ndevelopment, labour and decent work, and the 2014 \nClimate Summit. It is hoped that those discussions will, \nin the not-too-distant future, lead to lasting solutions \nto the development challenges faced by many of our \ncountries.\n\nOn another important matter, I wish to report \nthat Zambia has increased its campaign to forestall \nthe growing problem of child marriages and early and \nforced marriages. That problem is strongly rooted in \nthe prevailing poverty levels in some poor families \nand in the quest by organized criminals to profit \nfrom selling off under-age girls either into marriage \nor to engage in exploitative vices. With that national \nawakening to the problem, Zambia hosted a three-day \nnational symposium on the problem in July. We look \nforward to working with other nations to ensure that a \nglobal approach is developed to curb the incidences of \nchild, early and forced marriages, which is a problem \nwith greater consequences for the future advancement \nof women.\n\nZambia is also undertaking several other initiatives \naimed at reducing the gender divide. My Government is \nof the conviction that girls and women should be enabled \nand allowed to reach their full potential and be able to \ncontribute to national growth on an equal footing with \nmen. In that regard, the education of the girl child and \nthe socioeconomic empowerment of women through \ntheir representation in key decision-making positions is \nat the top of the national agenda.\n\nFurthermore, Zambia reaffirms its commitment \nto gender equality and the empowerment of women \nmade at the fourth World Conference on Women, held \nin Beijing in 1995, My Government has continued to \nstress the importance of women\u2019s emancipation and \ntheir contribution to national development in line with \nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.\n\nThe question of the reform of the Security Council \nremains an important priority for Zambia and the rest \nof the African continent. We remain deeply concerned \nthat little progress has been recorded in the negotiations \non the expansion of the Council. Africa remains fully \ncommitted to all five clusters of the intergovernmental \nnegotiations process outlined in decision 62/557, of \n2008. As a member of the African Union Committee \nof Ten on Security Council reform, let me echo other \nvoices in reiterating the importance that our member \nStates attach to the realization of those long-overdue \nreforms.\n\nMy delegation also accords due priority to the \nquestions relating to countries in special situations, in \nparticular landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), \nfor which group Zambia was nominated as Chair in \nMarch. The implementation of the Almaty Programme \nof Action, as adopted in 2003, has run its course, albeit \nwith mixed results. It is coming up for review at the \nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \nCountries, to be held in Vienna in just over a month\u2019s \ntime, from 3 to 5 November. The 32 Member States in \nthat grouping are counting on the support of the entire \nUnited Nations membership to ensure a successful \nConference, which we expect will firmly place the \nLLDCs on a sound path of development. I therefore \nlook forward to the full participation of Member States \nat the Conference.\n\nI would like to end by informing the Assembly \nthat our historic capital city, Lusaka, has for the past \n\nyear been celebrating its centenary. That occasion was \nfollowed this year by two other important celebrations, \nnamely, the ninetieth birthday of our founding father, the \nfirst Republican President, Mr. Kenneth Kaunda, and \nthe fiftieth anniversary of our national independence, \nwhich falls on 24 October.\n\nThe commemorations have offered a unique \nchance not only to celebrate, but also to reflect on \nour development path. I submit that within our known \ndifficult struggle to achieve social and economic \ndevelopment lies a strong national spirit, eager to \ncontribute not only to our own growth, but also to that \nwhich the growing global interdependence demands. \nLet me, on behalf of all Zambians, express appreciation \nto all those that have helped our beloved country in \nachieving those milestones. Zambia looks forward to a \nstrengthened and more versatile United Nations system \nthat will help create the conditions for the further \ngrowth and development of our youthful nation.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\nIt is a great honour for me to address the General \nAssembly for the first time, and I must say that I do \nso with great emotion. Commitment, solidarity and \nresponsibility are the three key words that have guided \nand will continue to guide my country\u2019s action at the \nUnited Nations. As a founding Member of the United \nNations, Luxembourg has based its foreign policy on \nactive participation in multilateral cooperation. That \nmultilateralism is founded on respect for international \nlaw and cooperation among sovereign and equal States \nin order to work collectively for peace, development \nand respect for human rights.\n\nFor us, the United Nations is at the heart of \nmultilateralism. We are committed to making the \nUnited Nations as effective as possible so that we can \nsolve together, in solidarity, issues that far exceed \nour capacities as States. We have the responsibility to \novercome such issues for the sake of future generations. \nCommitment, solidarity and responsibility also define \nthe approach that should guide our response to the \nchallenges facing us on the eve of 2015.\n\n\nWith the President\u2019s choice of the theme for this \nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, he calls \nupon us to develop and deliver on a transformative post-\n2015 development agenda and to ensure its effective \nimplementation. That post-2015 development agenda \nmust be bold and ambitious if we are to live up to our \ncollective responsibility to eradicate poverty and to \npromote sustainable development. It must build on the \nMillennium Development Goals and must go further. \nThe agenda must be holistic, action-oriented and \nuniversally applicable. It must benefit both developing \nand developed countries. It must be based on human \nrights. It must give the social sectors, health care and \neducation all the importance that they deserve. The \nissues of governance, justice, peace and security, as \nwell as the protection of the environment, sustainable \nconsumption and production patterns and sustained \neconomic growth, must be part of that agenda.\n\nLuxembourg supports and welcomes the important \nwork accomplished by the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals. Its report (A/67/941, \nannex) and the set of goals that it proposes are a useful \nbasis for the negotiations that will culminate in a year\u2019s \ntime in the adoption of the post-2015 development \nagenda and a new model for sustainable development \nthat reconciles \u201cthe ambitions of humanity and the needs \nof the planet\u201d, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.\n\nAware of its international responsibilities, \nmy country has a long-standing commitment to \ndevelopment, motivated by a desire for solidarity with \nthe poorest people. Since 2000, Luxembourg has been \none of the five industrialized countries to allocate at least \n0.7 per cent of its gross national income to development \ncooperation. In 2009, our development assistance \nreached the level of 1 per cent of gross national income. \nThe Government is committed to maintaining that high \nlevel despite a difficult budgetary position, which is no \neasier in our country than in others. Such aid can offer \nupcoming generations prospects and opportunities for \nthe future and, we should realize, can therefore, I hope, \nprevent certain conflicts.\n\nThe fight against climate change is an integral part of \nany global partnership for development. In that context, \nallow me to welcome the holding of the climate summit \non Tuesday. That summit clearly achieved the dual \nobjective set by the Secretary-General: to demonstrate \nthe essential political will to reach a global agreement \nin 2015 and to act as a catalyst for concrete action on \nthe ground so as to reduce emissions and to increase \nresilience. In the second half of 2015, my country will \nassume the presidency of the Council of the European \nUnion (EU). We will spare no effort to ensure that we \nreach an international climate agreement at the 2015 \nParis climate summit that is applicable to all countries, \nwith the objective of keeping global warming below \n2\u00b0C.\n\nWith its European Union partners, Luxembourg has \nmade binding commitments to reduce its greenhouse \ngas emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate \nchange. Before the upcoming meetings, in accordance \nwith the timetable that we agreed in Warsaw, the \nEuropean Union will present additional contributions \nto rise to the challenge.\n\nWe are also making commitments at the national \nlevel. I would mention, for example, our support for the \nstatement on carbon pricing, presented at the Climate \nSummit, as well as the new contribution of \u20ac5 million \nto the Green Climate Fund, which we announced \nat the summit, without any reduction in our official \ndevelopment assistance.\n\nThere will be no development without security and \nno security without development. And both development \nand security also depend on respect for human rights \nand the rule of law. We all know Kofi Annan\u2019s saying. \nLuxembourg has made it the guiding principle of its \naction in the Security Council since 1 January 2013 \nby devoting its undivided attention to the root causes \nof conflict, their humanitarian and economic impact \nand human rights, in particular the rights of children \naffected by conflict.\n\nTo illustrate that approach, I will talk about \nthe conflict in Syria. That conflict, which has been \nraging for three and a half years, now shocks the \nhuman conscience. There are more than 191,000 \npeople dead. There are 10.8 million Syrians in need of \nurgent humanitarian assistance, over half of whom are \nchildren. More than 4.5 million Syrians are trapped by \nthe fighting in areas that are difficult for humanitarian \nactors to access. More than 3 million Syrians have been \nforced to leave their country, over 1 million of whom \nare refugees in Lebanon. Those figures rarely make the \nheadlines now. However, behind those figures, there is \nso much suffering and so many shattered lives.\n\nThat cannot continue. We must put an end to the \nindiscriminate attacks against civilians, schools and \nhospitals, the bombardment with barrel bombs, the \ndenial of humanitarian assistance and the use of famine \n\n\nas a weapon of war. At the initiative of Australia, Jordan \nand Luxembourg, the Security Council unanimously \nadopted two resolutions on access for humanitarian aid \nto Syria (Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and \n2165 (2014)). I strongly hope that those resolutions will \nhave a real and decisive impact on the ground.\n\nHowever, humanitarian action cannot be a \nsubstitute for political action. The lasting settlement \nof the Syrian conflict requires a political solution \u2014 a \npolitical transition that meets the legitimate aspirations \nof the Syrian people, in accordance with the Geneva \ncommuniqu\u00e9 of June 2012 (S/2012/522, annex).\n\nToday, we cannot procrastinate in the face of the \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity committed \nby terrorist groups, in particular the Islamic State in \nIraq and the Levant. That group is neither a State nor \nIslamic. It defiles Islam and seeks only to spread its \nterror regime and to destabilize Syria, Iraq and the \nentire region.\n\nMy country fully supports the measures adopted \nagainst individuals and entities associated with \nAl-Qaida to cut off their channels of financing, to \nprevent radicalization and to stem the flow of foreign \nterrorist fighters. We do so pursuant to Security \nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), which we adopted the \nday before yesterday at the Security Council summit \npresided over by the United States President, Barack \nObama, in which I had the honour to particiapte.\n\nBeyond the fight against terrorism, we must tackle \nthe root causes of the grave crisis in Iraq. In that \ncontext, we welcome the formation of the new Iraqi \nGovernment of national unity, under the leadership of \nPrime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We encourage him \nto follow an inclusive approach that respects all ethnic \nand religious segments of Iraqi society and that is \nresponsive to the needs and aspirations of all. The Iraqi \npeople must regain trust in their country\u2019s democratic \ninstitutions.\n\nFor the third time in six years, this summer we \nwitnessed bloody fighting in the Gaza Strip. The cycle \nof violence must stop. The actions that fuel hatred \nand discord must cease. Israelis and Palestinians must \nfinally be able to live in peace, security and dignity. \nThe two-State solution, the peaceful coexistence of \ntwo democratic States \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 within \nsecure and recognized borders, remains the only \npossible way forward in that regard. A political solution \nmust be sought as soon as possible to avoid extremists \nfrom all sides from prevailing and to avoid measures \nbeing taken that would make the two-State solution \nimpossible. With its partners in the European Union, \nLuxembourg is ready to contribute to a global and \nsustainable solution.\n\nThe time allotted to me does not suffice to do \njustice to the manifold crises that we face today. I \nwould, however, like to say that they all bring one duty \nto light, namely, to protect civilians. That duty is at \nthe heart of the mandates entrusted to the stabilization \nand peacekeeping missions of the United Nations and \nregional organizations like the African Union in Mali, \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, South \nSudan and now in the Central African Republic. On the \nAfrican continent, our credibility and our responsibility \nto protect are at stake. Twenty years after the Rwandan \ngenocide, indifference is no longer an option.\n\nI should now like to say a word about my own \ncontinent, Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has step-by-\nstep turned into a conflict \u2014 one that, unfortunately, \nshows that the times when we thought peace on the \nEuropean continent had become self-evident are over. \nThe conflict has already cost the lives of more than \n3,000 people. It must end and it must end now. Dialogue \nand diplomacy are of the essence.\n\nFrom Syria to the Central African Republic, from \nIraq to South Sudan, the list of war crimes and crimes \nagainst humanity committed on a daily basis becomes \nlonger each day. The perpetrators of those crimes, of \ngrave violations and abuses of human rights, of violations \nof international law and international humanitarian \nlaw must be held accountable before justice for their \nacts. The fight against impunity must cease to be an \nabstract objective and become a tangible reality. The \nInternational Criminal Court has an important role to \nplay in that regard.\n\nWith regard to grave violations of international law \nand war crimes, I would like to draw attention to the \nviolations and atrocities committed against children. \nChildren are often the first victims of armed conflicts: \nthey are killed and maimed, they are abducted and \nrecruited, and they are sexually abused. They are \ndeprived of their right to education and health care. They \nare cruelly denied access to humanitarian assistance.\n\nAs Chair of the Security Council Working Group on \nChildren and Armed Conflict, Luxembourg is working \nin a determined way to strengthen and to implement \nfully the children and armed conflict agenda. We will \n\n\ncontinue to do so beyond our tenure on the Security \nCouncil. Children embody the hope and future of every \nsociety. All together, we must do everything we can to \nsafeguard that hope and future from the horrors of war. \nWe cannot acquiesce to sacrificing future generations.\n\nThe fight against sexual violence calls for the same \ncommitment. Sexual violence in conflict spares no one. \nIt affects adults and children, women and men. We must \nresolutely tackle this scourge.\n\nThe prevention of conflict is a core purpose of \nthe Organization. Spotting early-warning signs of a \nconflict is of crucial importance if we want to take the \nmost effective measures at the right time, and if we \nwant to prevent a situation from escalating into open \nconflict. We know that most conflicts are preceded by a \nsignificant deterioration in the human rights situation. \nIt is on that basis that the Secretary-General launched \nthe Rights Up Front initiative \u2014 rights before anything \nelse. Its aim is to strengthen the capacity of the United \nNations to act as a smoke detector before it is too late \nto prevent the fire from spreading or, to continue that \nmetaphor, to alert the fire brigade before the fire gets \nout of control. Luxembourg welcomes that initiative. \nIt is a forceful reminder of our collective obligation to \nprotect and promote human rights. It rightly places the \nprotection of human rights at the centre of the efforts \nundertaken by the United Nations to prevent conflicts.\n\nTackling the root causes of conflict, poverty, \ndiscrimination, the absence of the rule of law, to name \njust those few, is part of the same preventive approach.\n\nHowever, I also have to recall that in certain \ncountries, being different is not always accepted. The \nrights of minorities must be respected. It is unacceptable \nthat to this day, a religion or a sexual orientation, for \nexample, prevents a person from living freely in certain \nsocieties. Diversity is the richness of our society, it is \nnot a crime.\n\nAs I address the Assembly, there are numerous \nthreats to peace and security we must face that require \na holistic response. I have already addressed terrorism \nand our common struggle to eradicate that scourge. The \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction constitutes \nanother clear threat. The joint plan of action agreed \nin Geneva on 24 November 2013 was an important \nmilestone towards solving the Iranian nuclear issue. I \nwould like to reiterate Luxembourg\u2019s full support for \nthe efforts of the EU 3+3 to arrive at a comprehensive \nsettlement that restores trust in the exclusively peaceful \npurpose of the Iranian nuclear programme. I urge Iran \nto engage fully and in good faith in order to allow those \ndiscussions to lead to the expected results as soon as \npossible.\n\nIn Africa as well as in Latin America, small arms are \nthe real weapons of mass destruction. The devastating \nconsequences of the unregulated arms trade are well \ndocumented. I am therefore particularly pleased that \nthe Arms Trade Treaty, which was adopted last year by \na very broad majority of the Assembly, will enter into \nforce on 25 December. Luxembourg was honoured to \nbe among the first States to sign and ratify it. It is our \nfervent hope that we will be able to achieve our shared \ngoal of making it a universal treaty.\n\nAlso along the lines of threats to international \npeace and security, allow me to touch upon the serious \ncrisis caused by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \nThis is not a simple humanitarian emergency, far \nfrom it. It is a multidimensional crisis that threatens \nthe institutions, societies and economies of the three \ncountries affected by the outbreak \u2014 and the region \nas a whole. It calls for mobilization at every level: \nnational, regional and global. The Secretary-General \nfully appreciates the magnitude of the challenge, and \nwe wholeheartedly support the United Nations Mission \nfor Ebola Emergency Response. There is no time to \nlose. Beyond the contributions we have already made \nto the World Health Organization, the World Food \nProgramme, Doctors Without Borders and the Red \nCross, we stand ready to do more, in close consultation \nwith the countries of West Africa, many of which are \nLuxembourg\u2019s partners, as well as with the United \nNations and civil society organizations on the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, allow me to return to the three \nkeywords that guide our efforts: commitment, \nsolidarity, responsibility. It was our eagerness to work \nfor strong and effective multilateralism and our resolve \nto serve the United Nations that motivated Luxembourg \nto aspire to become a non-permanent member of the \nSecurity Council, for the first time in its history, \nfor the 2013-2014 term. During the past 20 months, \nLuxembourg has worked hard every day to show that it \nis up to that responsibility. It has worked hard to show \nthat it is worthy of the honour bestowed upon it by the \nGeneral Assembly when it was elected to the Security \nCouncil. We carry out our mandate in the name of all \nStates Members of the United Nations, and we are quite \naware of that. Today, I would like to take this opportunity \nto heartily thank the Assembly, in my personal capacity \n\n\nand in the name of the Government of Luxembourg, for \nthe trust placed in us. The Aseembly can rest assured \nthat we will continue to serve the United Nations to \nuphold our common values, the values of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "First, I have the honour to convey words of greeting \nand wishes of peace and prosperity to the Member \nStates and their people on behalf of the President of \nTurkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. I should \nlike to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election \nto the post of President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-ninth session and wish him success in his \nforthcoming responsibilities. I should also like to \nexpress my appreciation to Mr. John Ashe, President \nat the sixty-eighth session, for his skillful and effective \nwork in this post.\n\nThe current session of the General Assembly \nis taking place against the background of difficult \nprocesses that we see in various regions of the world. \nAssessment of these processes and their causal \nrelationships may differ, but it is apparent that in view \nof prevailing conditions the world community needs to \napply balanced, sober and a highly responsible approach \nto emerging and potential challenges and threats.\n\nThe peaceful resolution of these conflicts must be \nachieved by diplomatic approaches. It is an objective \nand imperative requirement of our times. Experience \nonce again vividly demonstrates that there is no military \nsolution to the international and internal conflicts in \ntoday\u2019s world. It is our firm conviction that the role of \nthe United Nations is acquiring decisive importance. \nThe United Nations must play the leading role in \nreconciling contradictions, preserving global stability, \nand strengthening peoples\u2019 faith in international \ninstitutions and legal frameworks.\n\nThe Security Council is called on to assume a \nspecial responsibility. Its functions and authority \nunder the United Nations Charter cannot be questioned \nor used to satisfy some individual or group interest. \nThe Security Council is and must remain the only \nuniversal legitimate body for maintaining global peace \nand stability and safeguardingthe political and moral \nfoundations of the modern global architecture.\n\nTurkmenistan has unceasingly and consistently \nadvocated the expansion and maximum use of the \nUnited Nations peacekeeping potential. Today, the \nneed for this is especially relevant. Therefore, our \ncountry proposes to actively begin the development \nof common approaches with a view to reducing and, \nin future, completely eliminating all potential risks of \nconfrontation.\n\nAs the Assembly will recall, the President of \nTurkmenistan stated at the sixty-sixth session that it \nwas necessary to adopt a United Nations declaration \non the priority use of political and diplomatic means \nto solve international problems and their further \nconsideration at the General Assembly. We are ready \nto engage in meaningful and constructive discussions \nwith all interested parties on this issue.\n\nThe logic of the development of global processes in \nthe sphere of security dictates the need for fundamental \nstrengthening of regional cooperation mechanisms. \nFor Central Asia, such cooperation should ensure \nfavourable conditions for preserving and maintaining \nlasting peace and stability and for successful responses \nto terrorist threats, extremism, organized crime and \ndrug trafficking.\n\nIn this connection, we consider it relevant to create \na standing mechanism of political consultations to \ncoordinate steps aimed at maintaining security in this \narea, as well as preventing and neutralizing conflict \nsituations and combating new threats. We propose that \nserious consideration be given to the idea of convening \na forum on security and cooperation in Central Asia \n\nunder the auspices of the United Nations as a starting \nplatform for further work in this area.\n\nWe stand ready to host such a forum in 2015 in \nTurkmenistan\u2019s capital, Ashgabat. As the host country \nof the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive \nDiplomacy for Central Asia, Turkmenistan advocates \nmultilateral support for its work, which has proven to \nbe highly effective. It is not by chance that in August \n2012 the United Nations Security Council emphasized \nthe great importance of preventive diplomacy and \nearly settlement of disputes and in this connection \nsupported the efforts of the United Nations Regional \nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. We \nare convinced that in the context of current and future \ndevelopments of political, economic, environmental \nand humanitarian processes in the Central Asian region \nand neighbouring areas, the mandate of the Centre will \nbe especially relevant and necessary. We therefore call \nfor more active involvement of that Centre in various \naspects of regional problems with the support of \nMember States.\n\nTurkmenistan also believes that it is essential to \nestablish a more focused and substantive interaction \nbetween the Regional Centre and international \norganizations, including the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization, the Commonwealth \nof Independent States, and other bodies, with a view \nto elaborating common approaches to such current \nissues as transnational threats, terrorism, illegal drug \ntrafficking, environmental challenges, management of \ntransboundary water and energy resources, and regional \nsecurity in the context of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\nIn speaking of this, I wish to underline that the \nsettlement of the situation in Afghanistan is a key \nfactor in achieving regional peace and stability. It is \nessential to support the positive processes that are \ntaking place in this country and to provide the Afghan \npeople with real assistance in achieving reconciliation \nand accord. That can be achieved only through peaceful \nnegotiation. There are no other options here.\n\nAs a neutral country and Afghanistan\u2019s immediate \nneighbour, Turkmenistan offered its political space for \nthe organization of a broad-based inter-Afghan national \ndialogue under the auspices and active involvement of \nthe United Nations. We already have joint experience \nin conducting negotiations in such a format. We believe \nthat it could be used today as well. Such dialogue, \nin addition to purely political aspects, implies the \ndiscussion of a full set of measures aimed at providing \nspecific economic support to Afghanistan and the \ninvolvement of that country in regional integration \nprocesses and future infrastructure projects.\n\nFor many years Turkmenistan has provided \nassistance to its neighbour in building social facilities \nand initiated the implementation of major transport \nand energy projects with Afghanistan\u2019s participation. \nIn particular, I note the project envisaging construction \nof the Turkmenistan/Pakistan/India gas pipeline, \npreparations for which are nearing the final stages. \nAnother major project, which was launched in May \nlast year, involves the construction of a Turkmenistan/\nAfghanistan/Tajikstan railway. We consider these \nprojects to be key in rebuilding the economy and \nsocial spheres of Afghanistan, and enabling it to make \nthetransition to a peaceful and creative existence.\n\nFor a number of years our country has consistently \nsupplied electric power to Afghanistan on highly \nfavourable terms. In the near future, thanks to the \ncommissioning of new power-generating capacities \nin Turkmenistan, we are prepared to increase the \nvolume of power supplied to Afghanistan many-fold. \nAs in the past, we provide purpose-oriented training \nof specialists for the Afghan economy, health care \nand social spheres. We will continue to provide all-\nencompassing help to the fraternal Afghan people. It is \nour principled position.\n\nTurkmenistan believes that the irreversible nature \nof the disarmament process is the most important \nprerequisite for the peaceful and creative development \nof the region and the establishment of a climate of trust, \nopenness and cooperation in Central Asia. Our country \nproceeds from the assumption that the inert model of the \npast century, which was based on the constant build-up \nof armaments, has become irrelevant in today\u2019s world. \nFurthermore, it considerably hampers and sometimes \ndirectly undermines efforts by States towards social \nand economic development, the enhancement of \npeople\u2019s standards of living, and the development of \nsuccessful economic cooperation. It is our conviction \nthat the fewer weapons there are in the world, the more \nstable and peaceful its development will be, and the \nmore trust and understanding among countries and \npeoples will deepen.\n\nWe call for consistent strengthening of international \nand regional cooperation in reducing the arsenals \nof weapons of mass destruction and the effective \nimplementation of the non-proliferation regime. As a \n\n\nparty to the basic disarmament treaties and conventions \nof the United Nations, Turkmenistan intends to continue \nto provide support to all the relevant processes.In this \nconnection, while emphasizing the landmark nature of \nthe first session of the Preparatory Committee for the \n2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that was \nheld in Vienna in 2012, Turkmenistan believes that it \nis key to continue the current dialogue on measures \naimed at expanding the international legal framework \nof non-proliferation.\n\nThis dialogue becomes especially relevant in view \nof the practical steps that are being taken in order to \nimplement the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone \nin Central Asia. Our country stands ready to engage in \nconstructive disarmament cooperation with the Office \nof the Deputy Secretary-General and to participate in \nthe implementation of a number of initiatives in this \nregard. One of the practical steps in the implementation \nof measures for disarmament could be the improvement \nof existing United Nations structures. In this \ncontext, we believe that it will be useful to consider \nthe establishment of a United Nations subregional \ndisarmament centre in Central Asia.\n\nTurkmenistan looks forward to the logical \ncontinuation at this session of the broad-based dialogue \non energy security as one of the fundamental elements \nof the United Nations sustainable development strategy \ninitiated by the President of Turkmenistan. As is well \nknown, in May 2013 the General Assembly unanimously \nadopted resolution 67/263 entitled \u201cReliable and stable \ntransit of energy and its role in ensuring sustainable \ndevelopment and international cooperation\u201d. The \nresolution was sponsored by 71 Member States. The \nadoption of the resolution was yet another major and \nconsecutive step in advancing international cooperation \nin the sphere of energy. We believe that adherence to \nthe letter and spirit of that document should acquire a \nsubstantive and purpose-oriented nature.\n\nIn this connection, we call on Member States and \nthe Secretariat to actively undertake consultations on \nthe practical implementation of the provisions of this \nresolution. In particular, we note the institutionalization \nof the work of the international group of experts on \nenergy cooperation and nominating representatives \nof Member States to that group. In December, the \nfirst international meeting of experts will take place \nin Turkmenistan. It is designed to launch systematic \nwork on the establishment of a new legal framework of \ncooperation in sustainable energy. We invite Member \nStates and all interested parties to take part in it.\n\nThe outcome document of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio de \nJaneiro, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution \n66/288, annex), emphasizes the central role of transport \nand mobility in sustainable development. We fully \nshare that approach. Moreover, Turkmenistan is \nconvinced that it is high time to undertake systematic \nglobal cooperation and strategic planning in transport \nas a separate, long-term area of United Nations activity.\n\nIn early September, Turkmenistan\u2019s capital hosted \na high-level international conference dedicated to \nthe role of transport and transit corridors in ensuring \ninternational cooperation, stability and sustainable \ndevelopment. The Ashgabat Declaration adopted at \nthe end of the Conference reflects the need to develop \nnew modern criteria for cooperation in this sphere \nthat are oriented towards diversification, security, \naccessibility, environmental safety of the transportation \ninfrastructure, and its maximum correspondence to the \nrealities of current global development, taking into \naccount the needs of developing countries, including \nlandlocked States. As the President of Turkmenistan \nemphasized in his address to the participants at that \nconference, the global transport strategy of the twenty-\nfirst century is a strategy for integration, combining \ngeographical and infrastructural opportunities with \nthe technical and technological potentials of States and \nregions.\n\nThe very fact of the convening of that conference \nwas a momentous event, signalling a comprehensive \napproach to the development of transport and transit \ncorridors based on constructive and real partnerships. \nOur country has submitted the Ashgabat Declaration \nto the Secretariat for its distribution among Member \nStates as an official document. We hope that it will be \nstudied with interest and that there will be further use of \nthis Declaration in international agreements, including \nthose of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly.\n\nWith a view to the accelerated development of \ninternational transport infrastructure, Turkmenistan \nadvocates closer cooperation and partnerships with \nspecialized bodies of the United Nations, first and \nforemost the Economic Commission for Europe and \nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe Pacific. We are convinced that such cooperation \ncorresponds to the logic of modern development and \n\n\ninternational cooperation in transport in the Eurasian \ncontinent.\n\nTurkmenistan fully supports the decisions taken \nduring the Summits on Climate Change held in \nCopenhagen and Canc\u00fan, at the seventeenth Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change held in Durban, and \nat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment. We look forward to the continuation of \nconstructive international dialogue on these issues. We \nare convinced that it is necessary to consistently combine \nefforts at the international, regional and national levels. \nIn this context, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s \nefforts to implement the agreed-upon decisions and \nhis sense of utmost responsibility in his approach \nto international cooperation with respect to climate \nchange issues. Our country recently launched a number \nof specific initiatives aimed at enhancing regional and \nglobal cooperation in this sphere.\n\nI wish to single out Turkmenistan\u2019s humanitarian \nefforts as a member of major United Nations \nhumanitarian agencies. Turkmenistan takes practical \nsteps to ensure the rights and freedoms of its citizens. \nIn particular, our country devotes major attention \nto solving issues relating to the rights of refugees, \nmigrants and stateless persons. Last June, in our \ncapital, the Government of Turkmenistan, along with \nthe International Organization for Migration (IOM) and \nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees, organized the International Conference \non Migration and Statelessness. Upon its conclusion, \nthe Conference adopted a declaration that spells out \nurgent tasks to improve multilateral cooperation, \nstrengthen international legal frameworks, and reform \nnational legislation on migrants andstateless persons \nand their legal and social protection, material support \nand adaptation. Turkmenistan will endeavour at this \nsession to translate the main provisions of this outcome \ndocument into reality. We reaffirm our desire and \nreadiness to continue close cooperation with the IOM, \nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees, Member States and all stakeholders.\n\nOur country views the sixty-ninth session as a \nmajor step towards consolidating international efforts \nto resolve key issues on the global agenda, to reaffirm \nthe leading role of the United Nations in maintaining \nand strengthening universal peace and stability and to \nagree on sustainable development goals. We reaffirm \nour strong commitment to cooperation with the United \nNations, our readiness to actively participate and \npromote its peacekeeping, political and diplomatic \nendeavours and to implement its projects and \nprogrammes in the economic, social, environmental, \nhumanitarian and other spheres.\n\nFor Turkmenistan, partnership with the United \nNations has been and continues to be a strategic priority, \na conceptual and practical foundation for our activities \nin the international arena.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would \nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nninth session, and to wish you every success in your \nwork. The delegation of the Republic of San Marino \nassures you, Sir, of its full cooperation throughout \nthe session. I would also like to express my country\u2019s \ngratitude to the outgoing President of the General \nAssembly, Mr. John Ashe, for his work during the \nsixty-eighth session. My country also wishes to extend \nspecial thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nthe energy and determination with which he leads \nthe United Nations and for his sensitivity towards all \nMember States, without exception.\n\nIn particular, I would like to underscore the \nimportance of the climate change Summit organized by \nthe Secretary-General in New York on 23 September. \nIt provided the Heads of State and Government with \nthe opportunity to demonstrate their political will \nfor a global agreement on that issue. The Republic \nof San Marino contributed to the work through the \nparticipation of its Head of State, thereby underscoring \nthe importance and acknowledging the indissoluble link \nbetween climate change and sustainable development. \nThe effects of climate change, which are often tragic, \nare one of the most serious threats to the future of \nhumankind and a challenge that all States, in the context \nof a joint action coordinated by the United Nations, are \ncalled on to face with commitment and determination. \nWe are accountable to future generations for our ability \nto achieve the goals of environmental protection, energy \nsaving and energy generation from renewable sources.\n\nClimate change is one of the causes of many natural \ndisasters that have befallen our planet, including this \nyear. We need to respond effectively to the many very \nserious humanitarian emergencies, which show the \nclear interdependence of the global threats now facing \nhumankind. Today, a strong, rapid and coordinated \nresponse at the international level is necessary to \ndeal with the very serious outbreak of Ebola that has \ndeveloped in some West African States and has become \na global threat. The most affected countries must not \nbe left alone or isolated. On the contrary, they must \nbe supported and helped. San Marino was among the \nsponsors of resolution 2177 (2014), recently adopted \nby the Security Council, which underscores the need \nfor an immediate mobilization of the international \ncommunity.\n\nWe are deeply moved by the problems at the \ninternational level, and, in the light of the theme \nof this session, \u201cDelivering on and implementing a \ntransformative post-2015 development agenda\u201d, we \nrecognize the need for a renewed commitment to \nfreeing the world from extreme poverty, inequality \nand hunger. However, we are aware that the full \nachievement of such goals is seriously compromised \nwhen peace and security, on the basis of respect for the \nequal dignity of all human beings, are not ensured. This \nyear, we have sadly witnessed too many incidents that \nrepresent a serious threat to peace, security and respect \nfor human rights. It is therefore impossible not to share \nthe widespread perception of a weakening of the United \nNations capacity to intervene and the subsequent \nquestioning of United Nations-led missions.\n\nLet us consider the following events. Since March \n2011, the conflict in Syria has already caused more than \n200,000 deaths and injured hundreds of thousands. It \nhas forced millions of people to flee their homes and \ntheir countries to escape a war that shows infinite forms \nof cruelty and ferocity. The Republic of San Marino \nhas strongly condemned and continues to condemn \nthe violations of human rights and of international \nhumanitarian law committed in Syria by all parties to \nthe conflict, without exception. The recent resurgence \nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has of late claimed \nthe lives of more than 1,000 civilians, among whom \nwere many women and children, for the most part \nPalestinian, including those who had sought refuge in \nUnited Nations schools. The San Marino Government \nand Parliament have appealed to both sides to let their \nguns fall silent and the desire for dialogue prevail, \n\n\naware that dialogue is the only way to achieve a peaceful \ncoexistence of the two peoples.\n\nThe situation is very serious in Iraq, where \nongoing ethnic and religious cleansing is taking place \nwith unprecedented violence. In the name of religion, \nsystematic and massive human rights violations, \nonly partially documented and evidenced, are being \nperpetrated. Such violations constitute massive crimes \nagainst humanity. A coalition of States is undertaking a \njoint response. San Marino hopes that the interventions \nare coordinated under the auspices of the United \nNations. In particular, it greeted with satisfaction and \nco-sponsored resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist \nfighters, unanimously adopted by the Security Council \non 24 September, under the leadership of the United \nStates President, Barack Obama.\n\nThe war that is being fought in some parts of North \nAfrica is causing the migration of thousands of desperate \npeople leaving for Europe every day in the hope of \narriving safely \u2014 a migration that, unfortunately, \noften turns into tragedy. The Mediterranean continues \nto witness the deaths of migrants from many areas \nof Africa and Asia. The information provided by the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is \nevidence \u2014 as if evidence were necessary \u2014 not only \nof the utter tragedy of the situation but also of the need \nfor a more united European action to address it.\n\nIn addition, this year has seen the crisis in Ukraine, \nwhich is a serious threat to the peace and security of \nthe entire European continent, owing to both the large \nnumber of victims and also the fact that fundamental \nprinciples, such as the territorial sovereignty and self-\ndetermination of peoples, are called into question.\n\nThese events demand the presence of the United \nNations and call for the entire international community \nto assume its responsibility and to restore the \nOrganization\u2019s capacity to intervene in order to protect \nthe citizens of the entire world through the peaceful \nresolution of disputes between States, as enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations and in numerous General \nAssembly resolutions. These events also underscore \nthe need for a reaffirmation of our Organization\u2019s \nprofoundly democratic nature so that each State, large \nor small, can make its voice heard and contribute to \nthe work and resolutions of the United Nations. These \nevents require that the cultural and religious diversity \nand the manifold traditions represented within our \nOrganization do not hamper the pursuit of possible \nsolutions. On the contrary, they should be a valuable \nresource, enabling us to adopt an approach that unites \nthe interests of the entire international community.\n\nWe recognize the duty and the responsibility to \nwork tirelessly for the definition and the implementation \nof the post-2015 development agenda. However, given \nthe seriousness of the international situation, a simple \nappeal will not suffice. On the contrary, precisely \nbecause, in many cases, a lack of integration between \nthe economic and the social and environmental aspects \nhas hampered the full achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, as the report notes, we are \nconvinced that we need new momentum and a new \nbeginning in order to restore elements able to promote \na culture of life, tolerance, acceptance and solidarity \nwithin our communities and populations. The first \nelement of that process, aimed at building a culture of \ninclusion, is the family. Recognition of the urgency to \ncreate such a culture demands of all States a common \ncommitment and renewed consideration to promote \nthe protection and support of the family. Indeed, the \nfamily is clearly the place where our main relationships \ngoverning human coexistence are developed. For that \nreason, weakening and marginalizing the family has \noften caused great existential confusion in younger \ngenerations with many serious personal and social \nconsequences.\n\nIn this spirit and with the utmost determination, \neach State must assume its responsibility and leave no \nstone unturned in resolving the numerous conflicts, \nwhich Pope Francis has referred to as the third world \nwar, since, if they were to prevail, they would nullify the \nplan for balanced development in the third millennium, \nas it should be defined in the United Nations agenda. \nSan Marino is a small State that has in its century-old \nhistory always considered freedom and peace as the \nsupreme goods to be preserved and protected. Based \non that identity, it is honoured and proud to contribute \nto the community of the United Nations. With humility \nwe call on all States to make every effort to give the \nUnited Nations strength and authority as the central \nreferral body we so keenly need today.\n"

        "file_text": "I \nam delighted to be here today to once again make a \ncontribution, on behalf of the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, to the debate on the present and future of \nhumankind. I am especially delighted as this sixty-\nninth session of the General Assembly is taking place \nat a time when the international situation is particularly \ndelicate. If we are not careful, three of its phenomena in \nparticular will surely delay us in achieving our agreed \ngoals. I am referring to the issues of terrorism, the \nresurgence of Ebola in Africa and the many threats to \npeace in various areas around the globe.\n\nDespite the commendable efforts of States and \ninternational organizations, terrorism, an extreme form \nof human intolerance, continues to claim victims \u2014 as \nmany in number as they are innocent \u2014 around the \nworld. Africa, which was once spared this type of \nsenseless violence, is today at its epicentre. The people \nof Libya, Mali, Kenya, Somalia, Nigeria and many other \ncountries in Europe, America and Asia are regularly \nbereaved by attacks, hostage-taking and summary \nexecutions. All States Members of our Organization \nmust face the threat collectively, as a moral obligation \nand the only effective strategy to eradicate this \nbarbarism surely and quickly.\n\nSince the previous session of the General Assembly, \na major public health problem has also hindered Africa \non its path towards development, namely, through the \nloss in human lives caused by Ebola in some countries of \nsub-Saharan Africa. In less than six months, the disease \nhas claimed over 2,000 lives, including approximately \n\n\n40 in my own country. Africa is leading a heroic battle \nagainst the virus. It deserves support.\n\nI am grateful to the international community, which \nis aware that, beyond the affected African populations \ntoday, all of humankind is under threat and which has \nextended its touching and effective solidarity to the \naffected countries. I thank the international community \nfor its significant technical and logistical support in the \nresponse against the epidemic. In the future, I hope to \nsee this fine example of human brotherhood prevail \nover the blind competition we see so often, and for it to \noccur with equal fervour in other sectors.\n\nAs for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nwhich is being touched for the seventh time by this \nscourge, we have not only managed to contain this new \nepidemic at its origin \u2014 in Boende territory, Equateur \nprovince \u2014 but also provided support to the fight \nagainst the epidemic in West Africa. Now that we have \nall but mastered the situation within the country, the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo is ready to once again \nsend its experts to the other affected countries.\n\nI take this opportunity to announce from this \nrostrum that, on the basis of its over 30 years of \nexperience in the management of Ebola outbreaks, in \nOctober the Democratic Republic of the Congo will \nset up multidisciplinary training centres to train health \npersonnel to respond adequately, in terms of quality \nand quantity of care, to the needs of African countries \nthat have been or could in the future be affected by such \nan epidemic.\n\nAs for the wars that are engulfing various parts of \nthe world, including the Middle East, Ukraine, Syria, \nIraq, Libya and the Central African Republic, we \nshould first recall that the United Nations was created \nfollowing a world war, in order to establish mechanisms \ncapable of preventing, or at least managing, situations \nthat bring the world only grief and despair; and then \nwe should ask ourselves why at this point, decades \nafter the San Francisco Conference, humankind seems \nunable to maintain and guarantee peace. Knowing that \nin this area any contribution is welcome, I would like to \nreaffirm the commitment of the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo to working tirelessly for peace and stability \nin Africa and around the world. That is the reason for \nthe presence of Congolese troop and police contingents \nin the Central African Republic.\n\nThe issue of peace is fundamental because, \nwithout it, humankind cannot realize or implement a \ntransformative development programme, as the central \ntheme of this session has it. Nor can that goal be achieved \nas long as terrorism is not contained and epidemics \nsuch as Ebola are not defeated. From experience, we \nCongolese know that there is no challenge that cannot \nbe met provided there is the will, the way and the \ndetermination. We all know where my country was \nbarely 13 years ago. Today I am happy to say that the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is standing on its \nfeet once more. It is a country where a newfound peace \nis consolidated a little more every day; a country whose \neconomy is one of the most dynamic on the continent, \nwith an inflation rate close to zero, a growth rate that \nhas exceeded the African average for almost a decade, \nand steadily increasing foreign exchange reserves; a \ncountry undergoing total reconstruction, with roads, \nschools, hospitals and much other infrastructure being \nbuilt at an unprecedented rate and speed.\n\nOn the political front, consolidating democracy \nand strengthening national cohesion remain our top \npriorities. In that regard, I wish to confirm that our \nforthcoming elections will soon be held according to \nthe schedule set by the relevant national institution, the \nIndependent National Electoral Commission. Every \neffort is bring made to ensure that our country will \nemerge from them stronger, more peaceful and more \nunited.\n\nRegarding security, through the application of a \njudicious mix of political dialogue, diplomacy and \nmilitary action we have moved steadily closer to the goal \nwe have set ourselves of banishing negative forces from \nour land and thus helping to bring peace to the eastern \npart of the country and to our neighbours. In order to \nconsolidate peace and improve social conditions for the \npeople, we are working to improve the business climate \nso as to stimulate investment, promote greater added \nvalue locally and create more jobs.\n\nAs can be seen, my country has resolutely taken the \nroad of reconstruction, development and re-emergence \nand the defeat of poverty, injustice and inequality. It is \nan undeniably daunting task, and we still have some way \nto go to achieve our ultimate goal. But the people of the \nCongo are tackling it with enthusiasm and selflessness, \ndetermined as never before to make our march towards \nprogress irreversible and to propel the country to a level \nof development commensurate with its potential. To do \nthat, we must preserve stability at all costs, and that is \nwhat we will put the majority of our efforts into from \n\n\nnow on. And we count on the support of our partners in \nprioritizing everything that may involve.\n\nBefore concluding my remarks, I would like to \nreiterate the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s \ncontinuing plea for Africa to be fairly represented in \nthe decision-making organs of the United Nations, \nparticularly the Security Council. The fact is that it \ndoes not make sense that Africa, a continent with six \nof the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world today, \nwhose growth rate and youthful population are portents \nof future demographic power and whose forests, \nfreshwater reserves and arable lands make it essential \nto the implementation of sustainable development \nstrategies, does not have a permanent seat within the \nentity responsible for ensuring peace and international \nsecurity. It is high time that this changed. It is a question \nof fairness, and it is also a condition of our collective \neffectiveness.\n"

        "file_text": "Today I would like \nto address some of the most important issues on the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s agenda.\n\nFirst are the growing regional and international \nsecurity challenges and threats, escalating conflicts \nand wars, and the aggravation of geopolitical \nconfrontations between large centres of power, which \ncould produce new areas of tension in the world and \nmake it more difficult to address the continuing global \nfinancial and economic crisis. All those elements are \ncause for serious alarm and deep concern. Uzbekistan \nfirmly believes that such acute contradictions and \nconfrontations can be tackled only through a political \npath and peaceful means, in strict observance of the \nfundamental principles of international law enshrined \nin the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nThe persisting instability in Afghanistan, which is \nexhibiting a tendency to escalate further, poses a serious \nthreat to stability and security in Central Asia and the \ngreater region. In the situation currently unfolding, the \naccelerated drawdown of the International Security \nAssistance Force may turn out to be counterproductive, \nand that could further complicate the state of affairs in \nAfghanistan.\n\nToday we can say with confidence that all the \nparties interested in resolving the Afghan problem \nare unanimous about one thing, which is that there is \nno military way to achieve peace in Afghanistan. The \nPresident of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, said so as long \nago as 2008 at a NATO Summit in Bucharest, and at the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s 2010 High-level Plenary Meeting \non the Millennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.3). \nThe presidential elections in Afghanistan this year \ndemonstrated vividly that the Afghan people are tired \nof bloodshed and violence, long-standing misery and \ndevastation. Today they want peace and stability and \nthe right to define their fate on their own.\n\nThe only reasonable way to tackle the Afghan \nproblem is to search for a political settlement of the \nconflict through peaceful negotiations and achieve \nconsensus to establish a coalition Government in which \nall of Afghanistan\u2019s parties in conflict and its national \nand religious groups would be represented.\n\nUzbekistan adheres to a policy of non-interference \nin Afghanistan\u2019s internal affairs. We are building and \nwill continue to develop stable, friendly relations with \nAfghanistan that proceed from the national interests of \nboth countries, and, on an exclusively bilateral basis, \nwe will support the Government elected by the Afghan \npeople.\n\nSecondly, in view of the ongoing global financial \nand economic crisis, transport and communications \ndevelopment and strengthened regional economic \ncooperation are key factors for ensuring Central Asia\u2019s \nstability and sustainable development. Implementing \nlarge transport and communications infrastructure \nprojects that can connect our region with global \nmarkets will promote interregional trade and economic \ncooperation, attract investment and help develop social \nand industrial infrastructure, as well as promote steady \nprogress in neighbouring regions. I refer in particular \nto such projects as the international Uzbekistan-\nTurkmenistan-Iran-Oman Transport Corridor, which \nwill link Central Asian countries to the Middle East \nby the shortest and most reliable and secure route. \nUzbekistan\u2019s completion of the Hairatan to Mazar-i-\nSharif railway, the first and so far the only functioning \nrailroad linking Afghanistan to the outside world, was \na historic landmark event.\n\nThirdly, as the States of Central Asia, like many \nother countries, are experiencing growing water \nshortages, the fair and reasonable use of the resources \nof the transboundary Amu Darya and Syr Darya Rivers \nbecomes extremely important to the life support and \nwell-being of the population of Central Asia. Uzbekistan \nadheres firmly to the principled position that the issue of \nthe reasonable use of Central Asia\u2019s transboundary river \nresources must be resolved according to the universally \nrecognized norms of international law and within the \nframework of the relevant United Nations conventions \non the use of international watercourses, which clearly \ndefine the principles of preventing damage to the \nenvironment and interests of neighbouring countries.\n\nWe believe it is unacceptable that certain countries \nin the region are promoting the construction of large \nhydropower stations with gigantic dams without \nconducting an international, truly independent, \nunprejudiced and professional expert study. \nImplementing such projects without thorough analysis \ncould exacerbate tensions and the potential for conflict \nin the region. Building such grandiose hydropower \nfacilities in a mountainous, highly seismic area with \na potential for earthquakes of magnitude of 9 points \nor highter could carry a high risk of devastating man-\nmade catastrophes. I wish to underscore that owing to \nthe potential for making ecological problems worse, \na growing number of countries around the world are \n\n\nrejecting the construction of gigantic dams and opting \nfor small and medium-size hydropower stations that do \nnot damage the environment, safety or socioeconomic \nwell-being of their populations.\n\nFourthly, the dynamic development of our economy \nand modernization of all spheres of the country\u2019s life \nhave enabled Uzbekistan to ensure the implementation \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead \nof schedule. Since achieving independence, Uzbekistan \nhas seen its economy grow almost five-fold and per \ncapita income increase 8.7 times, testifying to the \ngrowth in our standards and quality of life. In the past \n10 years, Uzbekistan\u2019s annual rate of growth of its gross \ndomestic product (GDP) has exceeded 8 per cent. By \n2030 we intend to increase the per capita GDP to $9,300.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of State expenditures are \nchannelled to fund social development, with more than \n34.3 per cent of that spent on education. Almost 100 per \ncent of school-age children attend secondary schools. \nWomen now represent 45.4 per cent of employed \npersons. We have achieved tangible successes in \nimproving maternal and child health, with the mortality \nrate among children under the age of 5 reduced by a \nfactor of 1.8 and maternal mortality rates by 1.6.\n\nFurthermore, Uzbekistan will do its utmost to \nachieve all its intended plans for the implementation of \nthe MDGs as soon as possible. We will also continue to \nundertake large-scale programmes in terms of the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n"

This morning, I \nstrongly reminded Presidents Dilma Rousseff, Cristina \nFern\u00e1ndez, Evo Morales Ayma and other Presidents \nof the Americas of the need to reorient, readjust and \ntweak the entire United Nations system. This system \nhas been in place for 70 years since the end of the so-\ncalled Second World War, which took place in Europe \nand other parts of the world between 1939 and 1945.\n\nThe United Nations Charter is one of the most \nbeautiful poems that we could ever read. It has well \nand truly become an instrument that has been set \naside, overlooked and consistently flouted in terms of \nits fundamental objectives are concerned. The United \nNations is an historic human experiment that has become \na landmark because never before has humankind had \na forum to meet to address issues of peace, affecting \nlife and death, and to negotiate solutions to conflicts. \nAfter 7,000 years of civilization as we know it \u2014 a \nreview of which reveals a history of empires and the \nongoing battle to distribute the wealth and territory of \nthe world \u2014 only with the establishment of this system \nin 1945 did we begin to get a glimpse of future light \nat the end of a long tunnel of battles, wars and global \nconflicts.\n\nWe call for the renewed relevance of the United \nNations, above and beyond any criticism that may be \nlevelled against it. Given the human importance of \nthis institution, we insist on the need for an in-depth \ntransformation, as Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said on \nmany occasions right here in this Hall. In his famous \nstatements in defence of the causes of humankind, \nhe stressed the need for a far-reaching democratic \noverhaul of the United Nations system. As President \nJacob Zuma of our sister country South Africa said, we \nmust democratize and overhaul the Security Council.\n\nThe role of the regions today is different from \nwhat it was in 1945. This is another world. The United \nNations was born to deal with post-war reconstruction \nand the issues that had given rise to conflicts. The \nUnited Nations has to deal today with a multicentric, \nmultipolar world of numerous actors, with emerging \ncountries and regions that have their own thoughts, \naspirations and desire to be respected in this world. The \nUnited Nations has to adapt and submit to the broader \nsovereignty of the peoples of this world, who are crying \nout for their voices to be heard, heeded and respected.\n\nWe have heard speeches today at the start of this \nsixty-ninth session. We also believe in strengthening the \nrole of the Secretary-General. As we have said so many \ntimes we must have a Secretary-General who represents \nall of us and who has the political and institutional \nclout to find solutions to the world\u2019s conflicts. We must \nreconfigure the system and functions of the General \nAssembly. We must democratize it and give it a leading \nrole to ensure that the great debates that take place here \ncan always successfully address the major issues facing \nthe world. That is why we believe that we must build a \nnew United Nations in a bid for a new multipolar world \nof peace where there no empire can impose its will on a \nunipolar world. This is urgent for the entire world.\n\nAbove and beyond what officials of the various \nGovernments represented in this Hall may believe, \nwe already have another world where we all wish to \nspeak, think and decide our own fate and to achieve \npeace for our peoples. A new regionalism has come to \nthe fore. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, we saw the \nbirth of the European Union as an experiment in the \nnew regionalism that is admired and emulated by many \nthroughout the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, we saw \nthe emergence of the Organization of African Unity, an \nextraordinary system to organize the brotherly African \ncontinent to address the issues of development and \nlife. Our mother Africa was one of the most suffering \nregions the world.\n\nNow as we embark on the twenty-first century, \nLatin America is taking its place. We have seen new \norganizations arise in Latin America. On 14 December, \nwe will commemorate in Havana, Cuba, a heroic \nisland and great homeland, the tenth anniversary of \nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. We have \nassumed an important role in building a new social \nand economic order in defence of such major causes \nas climate change. In existence for 10 years now, that \nyouthful organization, partnership or alliance is now \nlooking forward to the rest of the twenty-first century.\n\nI would also mention Petrocaribe and its \n18 brotherly member States. I hope I may be forgiven if \nI seem immodest, but PetroCaribe is a model that best \nshows how we can have a new world of peace, justice, \nsolidarity, cooperation and complementarity among \n\n\nnations. To the powerful of the world, those who wield \nall the capital and all the economic power, I say that we \ncan have another world. We are starting to build it in \nthe Americas.\n\nAlso emerging is the Union of South American \nNations (UNASUR), representing a new southern \nregionalism that was founded on 16 April 2007 with the \nparticipation of new leaders in Latin America and our \nCommander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. It is a most interesting and \nimportant bloc that is now starting to forge ties with the \nrest of the emerging world.\n\nWe recently held a very interesting and important \nmeeting for the remainder of the decade between the \nBRICS countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India, China and \nSouth Africa, who represent the hope for development \nthrough new mechanisms \u2014 and UNASUR in Brasilia, \nand we decided to share our experiences. The BRICS \nBank and the Banco del Sur would be a new financial \narchitecture for the world that must emerge from this \nnew regionalism. The Community of Latin American \nand Caribbean States (CELAC) was established on \n3 December 2011 in Caracas, and is already growing \nstrong. We have held summits in Santiago de Chile and \nHavana and will hold another in San Jos\u00e9 in January. \nAll of Latin America is coming together optimistically \nin this new regionalism.\n\nBased on this experience, we are seeing new \nstructures arise towards the establishment of a road \nmap for overhauling the United Nations system. Let \nthe call for reform of the Organization not fall through \nthe cracks here in this Hall. We must find the way. \nWe must try to come up with a common road map for \nhumankding because we need it if we are to tackle the \nmajor issues before us.\n\nFor 22 years, the United Nations has customarily \nvoted with record insistence for a cause that is not \njust a cause of the Americas but one espoused by the \npeoples and Governments of this world. I speak of the \nrejection of the economic embargo against our brother \nRepublic of Cuba \u2014 an anachronistic vestige of the \nCold War. The President of Estonia spoke earlier about \nthe anachronisms of the Cold War and the systems of \neconomic persecution used to impose political regimes \nand subjugate peoples. We are here on behalf of the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela to confirm our support \nfor the 50-year struggle of the people and Government \nof Cuba against the criminal blockade. I ask President \nObama: When will you seize the opportunity to go \ndown in history by putting an end once and for all to the \ncriminal economic and trade embargo and persecution \nof our brother country of Cuba?\n\nWe also see new causes arise in the current \nstruggles facing our region. We have taken them on in \nunison. I wish here to recognize as a great step forward \nthe decision taken by the General Assembly two weeks \nago in support of the Argentine Republic and President \nCristina Fern\u00e1ndez in her struggle against the financial \nplundering of the vulture funds. We want to support her \nin every way we can to ensure that the General Assembly, \nin accordance with the proposal of the Group of 77 \nand China and in as timely and efficient a manner as \npossible, drafts a high-quality document mandating the \ndefence of the nations represented by the Organization, \nespecially the poor countries of the developing world, \nagainst vulture funds that seek to plunder our economies \nand impose detrimental economic, institutional and \npolitical systems. We confirm the full solidarity of the \npeople of Venezuela with the people of Argentina, and \nindeed the solidarity of the CELAC countries. Let us \nmove towards this historic decision. We received 124 \nvotes in favour last week.\n\nAs we did at the CELAC summit in Havana, \nVenezuela also calls on the United Nations to support as \nclosely and warmly as it can and enforce the decisions \ncalling on the United States of America to enforce and \nexecute a decolonization plan for Puerto Rico. Puerto \nRico was invited to join CELAC because it is Caribbean \nand it is ours. We raise our voice to make it heard in this \nHall to call for the release of a man whose name many \nhere will hear for the first time. President Jacob Zuma \nof South Africa spoke of the great Madiba, Nelson \nMandela, who was forgotten for many years, despite \nthe fact that many now claim him as a representative \nof their causes. That is fine. Nelson Mandela represents \nthe human capacity of resilience and resistance enjoyed \nby people as they seek to achieve the objectives of \njustice and peace.\n\nThat is why I raise the name of a man who almost \n35 years ago was imprisoned and has been subjected \nto torture \u2014 a man with a family, a man from Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, a man like us. We are \ntalking about the Puerto Rican Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera, the \nlongest-held political prisoner who remains in a United \nStates prison to this day. We demand his immediate \nrelease. His only sin was to fight for independence and \nto defend the beautiful flag and star of the dignity of \nour sister country of Puerto Rico. These are the causes \nof this historic moment.\n\n\nVenezuela is in the midst of a people\u2019s democratic \nrevolution that began with an unimpeachable \nconstitutional event. For the first time in the history \nof our country, the Constitution of the Republic was \ndebated by the people and approved by a referendum \nwith the participation of the sovereign vote of the \npeople of Venezuela in 1999. Since then, we have been \ndeveloping and carrying out a process of political and \nsocial liberation.\n\nWe are trying to overcome poverty. In 2015, we \nwill have the post-2015 development agenda and the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be over. \nThrough great effort, the Bolivarian Venezuela led \nby our Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, was fortunately \nable achieve practically all the MDGs. We have an \nenrolment rate of more than 90 per cent in almost all \nschools, and we offer free, quality education from basic \nschools through to universities. We have lowered the \nunemployment rate from 20 per cent five years ago to \n5.5 per cent at the end of last year. We have changed \nthe curves. We had vulnerable employment to the \ntune of 60 per cent; now, 60 per cent of those jobs are \nprotected by social security, and are remunerated at a \nfair, regulated rate.\n\nI could spend hours here talking of the progress we \nhave made towards the MDGs. We have been able to \nsalvage our oil wealth. I am sure Members will know \nthat we have the largest oil reserves on the planet in \nthe beautiful Orinoco basin, and we have the largest oil \nfields there. For the first time in 90 years, we recovered \nfull control over our own petroleum resources as the \nanchor for our economic and social development. \nVenezuela has had to suffer ongoing harassment and \npersecution at the hands of the imperial forces and the \nallies of the United States empire, who have sought \nagain and again to undermine our democracy. One such \nattempt was the attempted coup against Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \nFollowing his death on 5 March 2013, those forces \nresumed their activities to undermine our country. I \nthank the Governments of the world for their solidarity \nwith Venezuela, which has been struggling and \nresisting. They could not prevail against Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \nand they cannot prevail against us. We are still on the \npath towards revolution, democracy, independence and \ndignity, with our own voice speaking to the world.\n\nThere are major problems that we now have \nto address at this point. As members well know, \none such problem \u2014 perhaps the greatest threat of \nall \u2014 is the virus that causes Ebola haemorrhagic fever. \nIf this world and our United Nations system had been \nsomewhat more humane, we would have focused on \nlending our support to tackling this real threat instead \nof sending drones, missiles and bombs to destroy the \npeople of Gaza or to bomb the people of Iraq and Syria. \nThe President of Chad announced that his country had \ndecided to donate $2 million to the Ebola fund. The \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela is going to be giving \n$5 million to the fund to support Africa and the needy \npeople of the world.\n\nLet us be clear. We should be discussing the \nscientific reports here and taking decisions based \non those reports. We should be focused on another \nimportant issue affecting the survival of humankind on \nthis Earth \u2014 climate change. A poem of the indigenous \npeoples of the Americas, which was read out yesterday, \nsays that after they can no longer poison the rivers, \nafter they have poisoned our lakes, once there is not \neven one fish left to eat, then the powerful of the \nworld will have to eat each other. They want to create \nextraneous formulas when all they need to do is to make \nan extraordinary effort and recognize climate change \nas a climatic emergency. We should not just make \nspeeches and vague offers; we must restore sanity to \nthe Organization if we are to strengthen it, and place at \nthe forefront of our agenda the real common problems \nfacing us.\n\nToday in the Security Council, they adopted a \nseries of decisions in a bid to combat terrorism. Let \nus be clear: we must combat terrorism. The Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America has been \ncondemning terrorism for more than a year and a \nhalf. We are deeply pained by the murder of Western \njournalists and the dastardly acts of these terrorists, but \na year and a half ago when boys and girls were captured \nby these terrorist and other groups in Syria, we were not \nthat pained at that time. They were beheading women \nin mosques. The pain should be the same.\n\nShould our pain be greater depending on the colour \nor origin of the skin of a person or the origin of that \nperson? The loss of human lives should pain us all, and \nwe therefore condemn the terrorist attack perpetrated \nby NATO and its allies to change the regime in Syria. \nI am here to say, with force of truth, on behalf of the \nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \nand my Government, that if the Government of Syria \nhad been overthrown by those imperial attacks, today \nin that entire region of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan \nwe would see the power of those terrorists take root.\n\n\nAs painful as it may be, we have to say that President \nBashar Al-Assad and the democratic and constitutional \nGovernment of Syria has always combated terrorism \nand has suffered thousands of deaths. We believe that \ninstead of the continual, demented bombing, must \nstrike a great alliance of peace against terrorism, \nrespecting the sovereignty of countries and sovereign \nGovernments throughout that region. I would ask the \ndelegation of the United States take note of this message \nand convey it to President Obama.\n\nOnly an alliance that respects the sovereignty \nof those nations, along with the cooperation of \ntheir Governments, peoples and armed forces, will \noverthrow the Islamic State and the terrorist forces \nadvancing like monster against the West. There is no \nother way to overthrow them \u2014 certainly not with \nbombs that kill mostly the innocent. They never kill the \narmed forces; they always kill the innocent. After so \nmuch death and bombing of the brotherly Arab people \nof Iraq, we have to invite the sovereign Governments \nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, \nJordan and Egypt and indeed the entire region to come \nup with a comprehensive political, military, cultural \nand communication strategy that can be supported by \nthe Security Council. Anything else is crazy.\n\nLet us consider what happened in Libya, as noted \nby the President of Chad. It only fomented hatred and \nan anti-Al-Qadhafi front. What is happening in Libya? \nIt has become a territory for trafficking in arms and \nexplosives by terrorist groups fighting for scraps of \nterritory. We have seen the end of the beautiful history \nof the people of our brother country of Libya. It is a \ncrazy race towards more violence and terrorism. A \nmore dangerous world has emerged from the demented \nwork of those who lead and make decisions in the \nOrganization.\n\nWe humbly lend our voice and our proposal to the \ntable, and we do so with genuine love. That is how we \nshow our solidarity with the people of Palestine. We in \nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \nwill continue to show our solidarity with them. \nVenezuela, as Members know, has opened a modest \nair-bridge to provide logistical support, food, blankets \nand medicines in support of the people of Palestine who \nrecently suffered a brutal attack. We want peace, total \npeace. Our Organization needs to be overhauled so that \neveryone can enjoy total peace. It is not through the \nthreat of the use of force, or the use of force, or internal \ncompetition to overthrow Governments such as the \none that I lead, that we will have stable peace. No, it \nis respect for international law that will lead to stable \npeace and full security.\n\nLastly, I wish to thank the General Assembly for \nits support. Next year, 2015, Venezuela, with members\u2019 \nsupport, will assume leadership of the Non-Aligned \nMovement for the next three years. We humbly aspire \nto play a genuine role in mobilizing and revitalizing the \nentire process of United Nations reform. The process \nmust include the elaboration of an agenda of world \npriorities in which we will all have a voice and a vote, \nand no one can impose their will on the others. Next \nyear, delegations from throughout the world will be \nwelcome at the historic Summit of the Non-Aligned \nMovement in Caracas.\n"

        "file_text": "This has been an \nenormously difficult year for the United Nations. As \nthe Secretary-General has pointed out, we are living \nin an era of an unprecedented level of crises. I echo \nhis call for leaders to unite. At a time when the world \nseems to be breaking apart, it will serve us well to \nremember what unites us. We need to look no further \nthan the Charter of the United Nations. The preamble \nto the Charter offers a vision that seems so difficult \nfor us to fulfil: we are determined \u201cto save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war\u201d.\n\nThe Organization was created, above all, to prevent \nwar. Indeed, it offers a system of collective security that \nis far more effective than anything that existed before. \nYet the events over the past year have shaken its very \nfoundations. At times, it seems that we revert to the \nhabits of past centuries. We are disturbed by the acts \n\nof aggression perpetrated against Ukraine and by the \nillegal annexation of parts of its territory. Those acts \nare massive violations of the principles on which the \nOrganization was built. They are a major setback for \ncollective security. As a small country situated in the \nheart of Europe and a member of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, we hope that we \ncan quickly re-establish a consensus on security issues \nin Europe.\n\nThe events in Ukraine also underline the need \nto ensure the enforcement of international law \u2014 if \nnecessary in a court of law. We now, for the first time since \nthe Nuremberg Tribunal, have a historic opportunity to \ncriminalize the most serious forms of the illegal use \nof force in an international court. Jurisdiction for the \ncrime of aggression before the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC) will be possible as early as 2017. The \nratification process of the Kampala amendments is well \non track. I welcome the ratifications by Latvia, Poland \nand Spain just a few days ago. We look forward to \nachieving that goal, together with the largest possible \nnumber of partners.\n\nFor truly collective work to maintain peace and \nsecurity, we need a collective sense of purpose. That \nis difficult to reconcile with the notion that a single \nSecurity Council member is able to block the action \nrequired if the United Nations is to fulfil its purposes \nand principles \u2014 with no questions asked, no matter \nhow large the majority in favour of such action. We \nof course accept the veto as a reality of the Charter \nof the United Nations, as we did when we joined the \nOrganization. However, we do not accept that the veto \nshould be used in a manner that contradicts the very \npurposes of the United Nations. We have witnessed too \nmany such instances in recent times. Change is urgently \nneeded. We therefore look for a commitment from \nStates serving on the Council not to vote against any \naction necessary to prevent or to end crimes of atrocity. \nWe look to the permanent members in particular to give \na clear commitment to that end.\n\nWe are determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental \nhuman rights and in the dignity and worth of the human \nperson. The United Nations, created as a family of \nnations, has the rights and dignity of the individual \nat the centre of its efforts. This is a human rights \norganization. The General Assembly, which we have \nentrusted to your leadership, Mr. President, during \nthis session, is also a human rights organ. The world is \nchanging at an ever-increasing speed. That requires our \ncontinued commitment to human rights.\n\nThe right to privacy, for example, is at risk of \nbeing lost. The digital era makes large-scale data \ncollection both easy to undertake and difficult to \ndetect. Discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual \norientation, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability or \nany other status remains rampant in many parts of the \nworld.\n\nThe rise of religious intolerance is especially \nalarming. Conflicts around the world are characterized \nby the persecution of religious minorities, be they \nShiites, Yazidis, Christians or others. We are witnessing \na disturbing rise in anti-Semitism. The Assembly should \nrespond by uniting in a call against the persecution of \nany religious minority anywhere in the world. I am also \nparticularly alarmed about the rising violence against \nhuman rights defenders, such as the recent murder \nof Samira Saleh Al-Nuaimi, an Iraqi activist and the \nmother of three children. There is nothing Islamic \nabout that barbaric act, committed by the Islamic State \nin Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\nIn times of conflict, international humanitarian \nlaw represents our hope for at least the bare minimum \nof human dignity. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are \namong not only the greatest achievements in the history \nof international law but also the most successful treaties \nwith their near-universal acceptance. Nevertheless, their \ncore principles \u2014 proportionality in the use of force and \na distinction between civilians and combatants \u2014 are \nviolated on a daily basis. The recent conflict in Gaza \nwas carried out at the expense of civilians by both \nparties to the conflict. The civilian population of Syria \nhas been experiencing enormous suffering for more \nthan three years now. Atrocities have been committed \nagainst men, women and children by the regime and, \nincreasingly, by other actors. Humanitarian access has \nbeen blocked systematically as a method of warfare. \nCivilians in both Syria and Iraq are left at the mercy \nof the sickening brutality of ISIL. There has rarely \nbeen a time when civilians were at greater risk of being \nvictimized by atrocity crimes. We are not living up to \nour promise, made some 10 years ago, to collectively \nensure protection against such crimes.\n\nWe are determined to reaffirm faith in the equal \nrights of men and women. Equality between men and \nwomen was one of the first things on the minds of the \ndrafters of the Charter of the United Nations just after \n\nthe end of the Second World War. Is that not striking? \nWe have certainly achieved much since then. The \n1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in \nparticular was a watershed moment in that regard. The \ncommemoration of its twentieth anniversary is the \nbest opportunity for us to show that we remain fully \ncommitted to its outcome.\n\nNext year we will also reflect on our progress on \nthe women, peace and security agenda 15 years after it \nwas established under Security Council resolution 1325 \n(2000). Clearly, we will have to find new strategies to \nprotect women in conflict from violence, in particular \nsexual violence. We are still far from using the full \npotential of women as agents of peace. Men have \nalways been in charge of making war and of making \npeace: their record is not impressive. Women must \nobtain their seat at the negotiating table, where they \nbelong and where they are needed. I am grateful to the \nSecretary-General for taking the lead on that issue and \nfor increasingly appointing women to high positions in \nthe areas of mediation and conflict resolution.\n\nWe are determined to establish conditions in which \njustice and respect for the obligations arising from \ntreaties and other sources of international law can \nbe maintained. Justice and the rule of law are areas \nwhere we have made important progress. International \ncourts and other judicial mechanisms are gaining \ngreater acceptance. Calls for accountability are \nbecoming louder. We can look to an impressive body of \ninternational jurisprudence.\n\nThat is particularly true for the International \nCriminal Court (ICC). Victims of the gravest crimes \naround the world place their hopes for justice in the \nRome Statute system. That is a great responsibility \nfor the Court, an institution which frequently works in \na politically charged context. Those who support the \nCourt must make that support felt. For that reason, I \nhave initiated an informal network of ministers who \nsupport the ICC personally as politicians. Our network \nhas grown to 26 members. We stand ready to defend the \nCourt and the integrity of the Rome Statute, because we \nknow that political attacks against the ICC are easy to \nlaunch but difficult to respond to.\n\nThe fact that the Court is an entirely independent \ninstitution that follows the law, not politics, does not \nmake the headlines. The fact that the ICC has jurisdiction \nin some places but not in others is easily misrepresented \nas selectivity. Our goal therefore remains for the Rome \nStatute to become a universal treaty. Victims of crimes \nin Syria, Iraq, Palestine and North Korea \u2014 to cite just \na few examples \u2014 deserve their day in court as much as \nthose in other parts of the world.\n\nWe are determined to promote social progress \nand better standards of life in larger freedom. There \ncould not be a greater challenge for the Assembly than \nsetting the global agenda for sustainable development \nfor the next generation. And there could not be a greater \nopportunity to show its relevance.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals were a \nsuccess. They set the agenda for more than a decade, \ngalvanized tremendous efforts for development and led \nto very significant advances. However, they were also \na learning process. We must be honest about where we \nhave failed and do better where we can. Three areas \nstand out in that respect.\n\nFirst, accountable institutions, access to justice and \nan effective fight against corruption are key ingredients \nof development that are truly transformative and \nsustainable. That is amply illustrated by national \nexperiences around the world and is well documented \nby research. Placing the rule of law at the heart of the \nsustainable development goal agenda will therefore be \none key of success.\n\nSecondly, there is no sustainable development \nwithout the full empowerment of women. Nothing \nshort of full equality between men and women will be \nrequired for development to be sustainable. We must \ntherefore fully recognize the empowerment of women \nas a key ingredient of sustainable development.\n\nThirdly, the implementation of international \ncommitments cannot be left to chance. We need \naccountability. We must establish a system to monitor \nprogress in the implementation of the post-2015 \nagenda, carried out by us as States but involving all \nstakeholders. The High-level Political Forum on \nSustainable Development is the best anchor for such a \nsystem.\n\nOur work to date in developing the post-2015 agenda \ngives us cause to be optimistic. Let us make the best use \nof the upcoming months to produce an agenda of which \nwe can be truly proud as a platform for collective action \nand an inspiration for future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to congratulate my good friend Mr. Sam \nKutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I wish him \nevery success in fulfilling that highly responsible duty. \nWe are also grateful to Mr. John Ashe for all his hard \nwork in presiding over the sixty-eighth session.\n\nAzerbaijan reaffirms its commitment to the \nimplementation of the global sustainable development \nagenda and to reaching an agreement on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. My country\u2019s record in attaining \nthe Millennium Development Goals is truly unique. \nOver the past 10 years, the gross domestic product \nof Azerbaijan has increased by 3.4 times. Now the \neconomy of Azerbaijan accounts for more than 80 per \ncent of that of the South Caucasus.\n\nThe unrivalled high rate of economic growth has \nbeen achieved thanks to the prudent use of available \nresources and the rapid transition to a socially oriented \nmarket economy. The poverty rate was reduced from \n49 per cent in 2004 to 5.3 per cent in 2014. Over the \nsame period, the unemployment rate has decreased \nfrom 10.6 per cent to 5 per cent. The Government \nhas been implementing large-scale programmes on \nimproving good governance, strengthening the rule of \nlaw, ensuring respect for human rights and providing \nfacilitated access to public services. Such programmes \nalso cover inclusive and equitable education, gender \nequality, the empowerment of women, better access to \naffordable energy and the protection of the environment.\n\nThe rapid development at the national level has \nenabled Azerbaijan to embark on a new road of official \ndevelopment assistance as an emerging donor. Over \nthe past years, Azerbaijan has continued to respond \nto the humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges \nfaced by developing countries through the Azerbaijan \nInternational Development Agency and other channels. \nThe commitment to contributing to international \ndevelopment is widely shared with our people. The \nleading non-governmental organization in Azerbaijan, \nthe Heydar Aliyev Foundation, has implemented \nnumerous social, humanitarian and development \nprojects in a number of countries.\n\nAzerbaijan has established itself as a reliable \nsupplier of energy in the global market. Just recently, \na groundbreaking ceremony to launch the southern gas \ncorridor was held in Azerbaijan. That $50 billion project, \nwhich envisages the construction of pipeline systems \nsuch as the trans-Anatolian and the trans-Adriatic \npipelines, will enable Europe to obtain gas supplies \n\nfrom a completely new resource base in Azerbaijan. \nThe Trans-Eurasian Information Superhighway \nproject, which was initiated by Azerbaijan, will \nprovide the countries of the region with information \ntechnology services, thereby facilitating access to the \nInternet, telecommunications systems and electronic \ninformation resources for 20 countries throughout the \nregion. Acknowledging the value of transport as an \nimportant mechanism for sustainable development, \nAzerbaijan has successfully launched several regional \ninfrastructure projects. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway \nis an important link that connects Europe and Asia.\n\nAgainst the background of the various threats and \nchallenges facing the world nowadays, it is critical \nto persistently stress the importance of promoting \nkey values of different cultures, enhancing better \nunderstanding among diverse communities and \nencouraging mutual respect. Located between the \ntwo great continents of Asia and Europe, Azerbaijan \nis a unique place, where the East and the West meet, \nwhere the world\u2019s main religions peacefully coexist and \nwhere the values and traditions of different cultures \nharmoniously complement each other. It is not a \ncoincidence that in recent years, Azerbaijan has hosted \nnumerous international events aimed at promoting \nthe dialogue among civilizations and enhancing \nunderstanding among different religions, faiths and \ncultures.\n\nViolence and fragility remain the greatest \nobstacles to development. The world community still \nfaces serious breaches of the fundamental norms and \nprinciples of international law. Peoples throughout \nthe world continue to suffer from devastating wars, \naggression, military occupation and ethnic cleansing. \nFor more than 20 years, Armenia has used force \nagainst the territorial integrity and sovereignty of \nAzerbaijan. It has occupied approximately 20 per cent \nof the territories of Azerbaijan and conducted ethnic \ncleansing against almost 1 million Azerbaijanis, as a \nresult of which no single Azerbaijani is left in Armenia \nor in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. No single \nAzerbaijani historical or cultural monument has \nescaped destruction in the occupied territories or in \nArmenia.\n\nIn 1993, the Security Council adopted four \nresolutions that reaffirm the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the \nuse of force for the acquisition of territory. Resolutions \n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) \ndemand the immediate, complete and unconditional \nwithdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from all \noccupied territories of Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the \nGeneral Assembly, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation and numerous \nother regional organizations adopted various decisions \nin support of the sovereignty, political independence \nand territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and demanded \nthe settlement of the conflict on the basis of those \nprinciples.\n\nUnfortunately, Armenia disregards all of those \nresolutions and the generally accepted norms and \nprinciples of international law and continues its \nmilitary occupation of Azerbaijani lands. Armenia \nregularly violates the ceasefire and deliberately \nattacks Azerbaijani civilians, which results in the \nkilling and wounding of inhabitants residing near the \nfront line. Just recently, several Azerbaijani civilians \nwho were visiting the tombs of their relatives in the \noccupied territories were taken hostage and tortured. \nSome of them were even killed by Armenian forces. \nIt is therefore critical that the international community \nplay a more proactive role in ending impunity for the \ncrimes committed against the civilian population of \nAzerbaijan. Combating impunity is important in order \nto ensure sustainable peace and reconciliation.\n\nTwo days ago, the President of Armenia delivered \na statement here during the general debate and tried \nto mislead the General Assembly by distorting the \nfacts and the situation with regard to the peace \nprocess, misinterpreting the norms and principles of \ninternational law and the relevant documents adopted \nwithin that framework (see A/69/PV.6). The President \nof Armenia misuses the noble principle of self-\ndetermination to cover up his country\u2019s attempts to \nannex territories of the neighbouring State, Azerbaijan, \nthrough the use of force. The situation, which he tries \nto present as the self-determination of the Armenians \nliving in Azerbaijan, has nothing in common with the \nprinciple of self-determination contained in the Charter \nof the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act. In \nfact, the principle of self-determination requires the \nreturn of the displaced Azerbaijanis to the Nagorny \nKarabakh region, where they will live together with the \nArmenian community in peace, dignity and prosperity \nwithin Azerbaijan. We believe in achieving that goal by \npolitical means.\n\nAzerbaijan stands for a negotiated settlement of the \nconflict without prejudice to its rights under the Charter \n\nof the United Nations, in particular those set forth in \nArticle 51. The Government of Armenia must realize \nthat the military occupation of the territory of another \nState does not represent a solution and that its reliance \non the status quo is a grave miscalculation. Azerbaijan \nwill never allow its territorial integrity, or the rights \nand freedoms of its citizens that have been violated as a \nresult of aggression, to be compromised.\n\nThe international community\u2019s unequivocal and \nconsistent support for the territorial integrity and \nsovereignty of Azerbaijan has been a crucial factor. \nIt makes clear to Armenia that the current status quo, \nwhich was achieved as a result of aggression, will never \nbe accepted. I would like to thank Member States for \nupholding the letter and spirit of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations by supporting the territorial integrity \nof Azerbaijan. The international community does not, \nand will not, accept attempts to change internationally \nrecognized borders through the use of force. Nor should \nthe world accept double standards. To do so would take \nus back to the dark chapters of the past century. In \nthat regard, the time is ripe to bring to justice those \nin Armenia who perpetrated acts of aggression against \nAzerbaijan and crimes against humanity and to impose \nsanctions on them.\n"

        "file_text": "This sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace in a global context full of challenges, testing the \nefficiency of the current international system. Greece \nremains fully engaged with the objectives of the United \nNations, whose universal ideals have never failed to \ninspire us.\n\nI should like to take this opportunity to emphasize \nmy country\u2019s alignment with the positions of the \nEuropean Union presented by the President of the \nEuropean Council in his statement (see A/69/PV.9).\n\nWe reiterate our support for efforts to reform the \nOrganization, including the Security Council, so that \nthe United Nations can better adapt to the ongoing \nchanges of our age and strengthen its operational \nnature and effectiveness in the exercise of preventive \ndiplomacy.\n\nAmong the challenges at the global level is \nobviously that of climate change, which is an absolute \npriority. A new universal agreement, legally binding \non all, is essential. Transition towards a new model of \ngreen economy with a low carbon footprint must be \naccelerated. Greece believes that the Climate Summit \nheld this week offered a unique opportunity to intensify \nthe efforts to achieve such a universal agreement.\n\nThe Greek presidency of the Council of the \nEuropean Union (EU), during the first half of 2014, \nsought to stress the importance of sustainable \ndevelopment. A significant joint statement was adopted \nin the framework of the ministerial meeting of the \nEuropean Union with African, Caribbean and Pacific \ncountries that was held in Nairobi last June.\n\nThe Ebola virus epidemic has become a genuine \nthreat to global peace and security with its serious \nsocial, economic and humanitarian repercussions. An \ninternational strategy is necessary to contain the virus \nand to avoid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis \nthat would precipitate the collapse of the health-care \nsystem and, eventually, of the social fabric of the States \naffected. Therefore we welcome the decision of the \nSecretary-General to establish the new mission, the \nUnited Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, \nand we pledge that Greece will offer its full support to \nany initiative taken in order to combat the epidemic.\n\nThe current complex security challenges require us \nto unite our forces, both internationally and regionally. \nGreece supports the strengthening of cooperation \nbetween the European Union and the United Nations \nin crisis management, particularly by implementing the \naction plan on United Nations peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe world is facing a series of unprecedented \ncrises in the Middle East and in North Africa, as well \nas the eastern area of the European Union. Of course, \nin the face of such multiple crises, a consistent and \nglobal comprehensive strategy is required. Certainly, \nfrom this standpoint the role of the United Nations, \nespecially the Security Council, is the deciding factor. \nThat is the only way that we will be able to deal with \nthe critical dilemma confronting us now, the dilemma \nbetween democracy and security. But if there is to be \ndemocracy, there must be a State that is functioning \n\nand does not dissolve, as well as minimal security \nconditions.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis seriously affects security \nand stability in Europe. We are concerned by the \ndeteriorating humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, \nand we support the territorial integrity, independence \nand sovereignty of Ukraine.\n\n(spoke in English)\nWe support the 5 September Minsk agreement, \nthe full implementation of which can contribute to the \nresolution of the crisis through diplomatic and political \nmeans. The key is the achievement of an inclusive \nsolution.\n\nRegarding security concerns in our neighbourhood, \nwe welcome the adoption in Egypt of the 26 August \nIsraeli-Palestinian ceasefire agreement, which we \nhope will pave the way to relaunching the political \nprocess aimed at establishing a durable peace, which is \nobviously a prerequisite for a comprehensive solution \nallowing two States, Israel and Palestine, to coexist in \nsecurity.\n\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s newly appointed Special \nEnvoy for Syria must continue efforts to ensure the \neffective relaunching of the Geneva II political process. \nThat is all the more imperative given the barbaric \nactions of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \n(ISIS) and other jihadist groups in Syria and the Iraqi-\nSyrian border regions. Foreign fighters joining jihadist \nterrorist organizations are a serious threat to regional \nand global security. As a member of the international \nalliance against ISIS and extreme jihadists, Greece \nfully supports the new Security Council resolution \n2178 (2014), on how the international community must \nact against ISIS and potential foreign fighters. In that \nregard, I wish to make special reference to the grave \nhumanitarian situation and increasing refugee pressure \non countries of the region, including Greece.\n\nMilitary means alone cannot eliminate the jihadist \nthreat. We must also promote an inclusive process of \nreconciliation and national dialogue in Iraq to counter \nthat threat to the country\u2019s national unity and territorial \nintegrity. We remain seriously concerned at the \ndisplacement of civilians, and we strongly condemn the \nsystematic persecution of Christians and other religious \ncommunities.\n\nThe region\u2019s stability is also under threat from the \nongoing violence in Libya. We strongly support the \nUnited Nations coordination of relevant international \nefforts. We therefore welcome the appointment of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s new Special Representative.\n\nDeeply concerned at the life-threatening conditions \njournalists are increasingly confronting and the \ncensorship and persecution the media are facing, \nGreece co-sponsored last year\u2019s resolution 68/163, on \nthe safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. We \nare now co-sponsoring this year\u2019s draft resolution on \nthe protection of journalists.\n\nDuring its European presidency in the first half of \n2014, Greece emphasized Western Balkan integration \ninto the European Union. That objective requires \nimplementation of internal reforms in accordance with \nEU standards and the promotion of good-neighbourly \nrelations through regional cooperation, reconciliation \nand effective confrontation of the sources of nationalism. \nWe welcome the significant progress so far in the EU-\nfacilitated Belgrade-Pristina talks. We hope that the \ntwo sides will continue their constructive discussions \nin a spirit of compromise.\n\nWith respect to the issue of the name of the \nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece fully \nrespects the process directed by the Secretary-General \nthrough his Personal Envoy, Mr. Matthew Nimetz, and \nalways participates constructively and with goodwill. \nGreece has already taken considerable steps. We are \nawaiting corresponding steps from the other side. We \npropose a mutually acceptable compound name, with \na geographical qualifier before the word \u201cMacedonia\u201d, \nfor all uses and purposes, internally and internationally, \nerga omnes.\n\nGreece supports the European and Euro-Atlantic \nperspective of that neighbouring country and has long \nbeen among the top foreign direct investors there. Its \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic perspective hinges not on \nthe name or on Greece, but on respect for the general \ncriteria in place for all accession-candidate countries. \nIt hinges on issues of democracy, rule of law, respect \nfor human rights, harmonious inter-ethnic relations and \nfreedom of the press. As the relevant European Council \nconclusions say, tangible steps need to be taken on \nthose issues.\n\nThis past summer marked the fortieth anniversary \nof the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the international \ncommunity continues to confront the ongoing illegal \nmilitary occupation of the territory of a United Nations \nand European Union member State. Greece fully \n\nsupports the dialogue between the leaders of the two \ncommunities within the framework of the February \n2014 joint communiqu\u00e9 and the initiatives of President \nAnastasiades for confidence-building measures that \ncan create new momentum on the island.\n\nA just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem \nmust be in accordance with the relevant Security Council \nresolutions, the high-level agreements, the February \n2014 joint communiqu\u00e9 and the European acquis. The \nCypriot people must express their agreement to such \na solution through a referendum. We also attach great \nimportance to maintaining the mandate, level and \nconcept of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in \nCyprus and to the Secretary-General\u2019s good offices \nmission. We welcome the appointment of Mr. Eide as \nhis new Special Adviser on Cyprus.\n\nA just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue and \nrespect for international law, especially the international \nlaw of the sea, are two critical factors on which the \nfull development of Greek-Turkish relations depends. \nThese relations have great potential, and are critical to \nthe stability of the wider region as they are relations \nbetween two NATO member States, while Greece also \nsupports Turkey\u2019s European perspective.\n\nChallenging times require demanding choices. \nThe United Nations is in a position to tackle the new \nchallenges, as it has so often done in the past, provided \nwe all share the same vision and, most importantly, the \nnecessary political will.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Next year we will \ncelebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United \nNations. As we approach that milestone, it is good \nto reflect on the successes of our Organization: the \nextensive codification of international law, advances \nin combating poverty and disease, and fighting \nhuman rights abuses. We have established monitoring \nmechanisms, such as the human rights treaty bodies, \nand accountability tools, such as the International \nCriminal Court, and agreed on historic policy targets \nthat have transformed international cooperation, such \nas the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\nThese are not small achievements, but sitting on \nour laurels is not an option. The system of rule-bound \nrelations between nations is under threat, and we must \nprotect it. Most worrying is the growing disregard for \ninternational law. This erodes the international legal \nframework we have developed since the Second World \nWar. A shocking recent example is the terrorist group \noperating in Iraq and Syria, the self-styled Islamic \nState in Iraq and the Levant. As human beings, we are \nrevolted by its brutality and appalled by its mindless \ndestruction.\n\nThe international community cannot accept the \ndisregard for the fundamental principles of the United \nNations \u2014 indeed, of human decency \u2014 shown by this \ngroup. Iceland therefore agrees with the lawful actions \ntaken to end these atrocities by countries of the region \nand from other parts of the world. Iceland will contribute \nhumanitarian aid through the United Nations agencies. \nNo civilized nation can look the other way when the \nbarbarism and cruelty are so overwhelming. The United \nNations and international law must be centre stage, \nand we underscore the role of the Security Council in \nmaintaining international peace and security.\n\nThe suffering of the Syrian people and the total \ndisrespect for humanitarian law in that civil war are \nequally shocking. Almost 200,000 people have died, \n3 million refugees are abroad, and the country is in \nruins. The prolonged foreign occupation of the State \nof Palestine is another violation of international law. \nLand-grabbing continues unabated. The blockade \nof Gaza shows no signs of being lifted. Violations of \nhuman rights continue, including against freedom of \nmovement, the right to freedom of speech and assembly \nand property rights.\n\nThis summer, a pointless war between Israel and \nGaza caused an unacceptable loss of life. I condemn \nthe indiscriminate rocket attacks of Hamas and other \nmilitant organizations in Gaza against civilian targets \nin Israel. I also condemn the disproportionate use of \nforce by the Israel Defense Forces, which resulted in \nmore than 2,000 deaths in Gaza. Let the loss of life \nnot have been in vain and let the future of Palestinian \nchildren be a future without foreign occupation. A \ntwo-State solution, with the comprehensive support \nof neighbouring countries and robust international \npeacekeeping arrangements, should be the objective. \nTo the Palestinians I say, \u201cReconcile. Be your own \nbest friends so you can build a free and sovereign \nPalestine ensuring fundamental rights and freedom \nfor all\u201d. To the Israelis, I say, \u201cThe current situation \nis unsustainable. Be brave, be wise and give peace a \nchance. The occupation of Palestine must end.\u201d\n\nThe violation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity \nbreaches the Charter of the United Nations, international \nlaw and numerous treaties. The illegal annexation of \nCrimea threatens security and stability throughout \nEurope. The credibility of the Security Council is \nseriously undermined when a permanent member \nviolates the Charter by using force to change borders, \nand then can veto the necessary response and actions \nby the body empowered to maintain international peace \nand security. The Council is also undermined when it \nproves incapable of defending civilians who are subject \nto foreign occupation or is unable to prevent the use of \nchemical weapons.\n\nThe United Nations was founded to ensure that \nthe fate of nations would never again be decided at the \nbarrel of a gun. Recent events have shown that we must \nreaffirm our commitment to the Charter of the United \nNations and other legal instruments to safeguard the \nfoundations of a just and peaceful world. This holds \nparticularly true for the Security Council. In its role \n\n\nof maintaining international peace and security, \nits compass should be the Charter of the United \nNations and international law, including international \nhumanitarian law and human rights law. It should apply \nthe law equally to all parties. The Council needs to \nbecome more solution-oriented and directly engaged. \nIts working methods must improve, especially the \napplication of the veto. Iceland supports the recent \nFrench- and Mexican-led proposal for framing the veto \nin cases of mass atrocities. The Council should also \nmake use of its referral power as intended by the Rome \nStatute.\n\nIn a world riven by inequality, poverty and onflict, \nit is a challenge to chart a path towards the future we \nwant. Since the most recent general debate, we have \nmade real progress in preparing for the decisions to \nbe taken next year on a new framework for sustainable \ndevelopment. The year ahead will be a test of our resolve \nto deliver. Iceland will participate constructively in the \nnegotiations for the post-2015 agenda, as well as for a \nnew regime to address climate change.\n\nAllow me to highlight a few issues that I believe to \nbe fundamental. With an increasing world population, \nmeasures to ensure food security are more important \nthan ever. For 3 billion people, seafood provides about \n20 per cent of their intake of animal protein. Nine to 12 \nper cent of the global population depends on the seafood \nsector for their livelihood. Yet we have a paradox. \nOverfishing remains a widespread problem, but at \nthe same time fisheries are greatly underperforming. \nWith improved infrastructure and better management, \nthe economic benefits from marine fisheries could be \nincreased by $50 billion per year, or more than half the \nvalue of the global seafood trade.\n\nIt is clear that ocean issues are one of the keys \nto the post-2015 development agenda. The United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides \na sound legal basis on which States can harness their \nmarine resources. Iceland remains firmly loyal to \nthe Convention, and we build our marine policy on \nscientific research where sustainability guides all our \ndecisions. The Convention on the Law of the Sea has \nbeen instrumental to Iceland\u2019s success, yet what is often \nlacking is the capacity of States to implement effective \nmonitoring and sustainable harvesting. Iceland has \nbeen sharing know-how through the United Nations \nUniversity Fisheries Training Programme in Iceland, \nwhere over 1,500 experts have benefited from post-\ngraduate studies and workshops in the field.\n\nThe second key area for ensuring food security is \nland. Every decade, 120 million hectares of land \u2014 an \narea the size of South Africa \u2014 are lost to desertification \nand drought. Climate change is contributing to an ever-\nfaster rate of land degradation, which in turn releases \ngreenhouse gases, creating a vicious circle. Switching \nto sustainable land management is therefore not only \ncrucial to food and water security, but an important \nfactor in mitigating and adapting to climate change. This \nis why Iceland argues strongly for measures to achieve \na land-degradation neutral world. Iceland contributes \nactively to these efforts through the Group of Friends \nof the Secretary-General in New York and through the \nUnited Nations University Land Restoration Training \nProgramme in Iceland.\n\nA third key area is to ensure access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. No \nsociety can develop without energy, yet today over \n1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. As \nenergy production grows, it is essential to substantially \nincrease the share of renewable energy in the global \nenergy supply by 2030. Iceland is contributing to that \neffort. We have partnered with a group of countries and \nthe International Renewable Energy Agency to identify \nopportunities and to support mechanisms to scale up \ngeothermal production. In that connection, we invite \nMember States to join the Global Geothermal Alliance. \nIceland has also been working with the World Bank on \nprojects in the Great African Rift Valley, and we have \nrun the Geothermal Training Programme of the United \nNations University in Iceland for 35 years.\n\nIn Iceland and the other Nordic countries, the \nrevolution in women\u2019s education and the high level of \nfemale participation in the labour market have been \nthe basis of our welfare and economic prosperity. \nWithout the full and equal participation of women in \nall spheres of society, including in decision-making, it \nwill be impossible to make real and lasting progress \nin addressing sustainable development challenges. \nThe stand-alone goal on gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment agreed in the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals must be maintained. \nBut we should not stop there. Gender equality must be \nfurther mainstreamed throughout the new framework. \nIn that regard, I cannot leave out the centrality of \nensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nWe must continue to fight for the full \nimplementation of the commitments we made almost \n20 years ago in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for \n\n\nAction. Iceland is proud to support UN-Women in the \ncampaign to celebrate Beijing+20. We have partnered \nwith Suriname to lead a friends\u2019 group of countries \nto galvanize support to promote gender equality and \nto commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the \nDeclaration. We call on Member States to join that \neffort and take concrete actions on the 12 themes of the \nPlatform for Action.\n\nFor our part, we want to bring men and boys to the \ntable on gender equality in a positive way. Iceland and \nSuriname will convene a \u201cbarbershop\u201d conference in \nJanuary 2015, where men will discuss gender equality \nwith other men, with a special focus on addressing \nviolence against women. That will be a unique \nconference, as it will be the first time at the United \nNations that we bring together only male leaders to \ndiscuss gender equality. It will provide an exceptional \ncontribution to the Beijing+20 conference and the \nHeForShe campaigns.\n\nWe have been reminded in recent weeks of the \nfragility of human beings and the need for us to work \ntogether on the biggest threats to humankind. Let me \nexpress our sympathy for and solidarity with the States \nsuffering from the Ebola outbreak. The Government of \nIceland will join in the international effort to curb the \noutbreak with financial contributions to United Nations \nagencies.\n\nNext year, the States Members of the United Nations \nwill come together to make important decisions on \nhow to address climate change and pursue sustainable \ndevelopment. In the North, Arctic biodiversity and \necosystems are threatened by climate change, and \nsustainable harvesting of natural resources is vital. I \npledge Iceland\u2019s commitment to work for bold decisions \non the future of our planet and the increased prosperity \nof the world community in the year 2015. May the wise \nwords of Nelson Mandela come true as we navigate that \npath: \u201cIt always seems impossible until it\u2019s done.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "\u201cIf you seek peace, prepare for war.\u201d Those are the words of Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus\u2019 fourth- or fifth-century tract De Re Militari, written more than 1,600 years ago. People have quoted that saying numerous times and in many circumstances. If the Assembly believes after all this that I am going to speak about the wars and armed conflicts raging throughout the world, it is mistaken. Instead, I would like to speak to the Assembly about a war and a battle that we seem to be losing. It is a war we are waging against our own natural environment and against our own human nature.\nTwo days ago here in the General Assembly Hall, many heard the words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President Obama about the dire consequences of climate change (see A/69/PV.6). We heard very detailed statistics illustrating the gravity of the situation and the need for us to pool our efforts. And we have been preparing for that for a long time.\nWhen did we first notice signs of trouble with the environment? Few people may know that the first clear signal came in 1896, when a Swedish scientist wrote that an increase in the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide would lead to a temperature rise; 60 years later, we had precise measurements to substantiate his statement. Another 30 years had to pass before here, in the United Nations, it was understood that some type of treaty or agreement would be necessary in the future to deal with the issue. Another 10 years had to pass before the Kyoto Protocol was signed. Between the first realization and the Kyoto agreement a century had passed.\nAfter Kyoto, a number of conferences, scientific meetings and political gatherings were held. In recent decades, many people have spoken on many occasions about the consequences of climate change and the need to do something. Still the situation has continued to deteriorate. Let me cite one statistic. Since 1990 \u2014 that is, during the past 25 years \u2014 despite all the resolve, the Kyoto agreement and all the promises, we have seen a 30 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nDespite the fact that Mother Nature has warned us again and again, adverse climate events continue to occur one after the other. Allow me to mention a few examples from the past year. In 2013 in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, there were freezing temperatures in January, which was unprecedented. At the same time, in Lapland in Finland \u2014 not exactly the Mediterranean region \u2014 in May the temperature had reached 31\u00b0C, while Bethlehem experienced a white Christmas that no one remembered having seen before. In Australia, over the course of 90 days last summer, 123 temperature records were set.\nThe Danube is the largest river in Europe and it has warned us again and again. Allow me to report a Hungarian example. Since before the Second World War, the Danube River has flooded many times, but until recently it had never risen to the level of 8 metres, even at the flood\u2019s highest point. In the past four years, the Danube has risen above 8 metres on four separate occasions. In fact last year, it rose close to 9 metres.\nFloods, typhoons and other adverse meteorological events are taking place in regions where they have never occurred before and at unprecedented times of the year. We are meeting here in New York. Two years ago here in New York, Hurricane Sandy caused damage valued at $20 billion, and more than 40 people died. This all took place despite the fact that for years on end the New York City leadership had been cautioned by scientists that trouble would occur and that protection for embankments, among others, must be strengthened. A few hundred million dollars would have been spent to that end; instead, the damage caused by Sandy cost far more. That is why, two days ago, the Assembly heard the Mayor of New York speak of the next 35 years and the desire to reduce New York\u2019s emissions by 80 per cent.\nIn recent days, we have spoken on many occasions about our preparations for the 2015 Paris conference and the desire to reach an agreement there. I believe that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon needs to be recognized in that regard. He has truly done his utmost to ensure that we can reach a common conclusion in Paris in 2015. The question is, are we Member States doing all we can? Will we do all that we can to ensure success in Paris?\nThe speeches I have heard over the past few days have not made me optimistic. The speeches I have heard deflected responsibility and reflected a type of political narrow-mindedness that is not terribly promising. Why can we not listen to the wisdom and advice of our scientists? Why can we not accept scientific results that today appear evident? Why can we not accept the signals being dispatched by our planet? Why can we not learn from all of the lessons provided by Mother Nature? Why are we not learning from our own example?\nThere is one good example that we could learn from. It involves chlorofluorocarbon gases and the damage they cause to the ozone layer. Basically, those gases were first used in the 1950s. It took only 30 years for the ozone layer to be reduced by 40 per cent in the area above Antarctica. That was also enough time for people in every country to understand the medical consequences. I note, among others, the high incidence of dermatological cancers. It was basically only at the very last moment in Montreal that an agreement was struck, as a result of which we banned those gases. After 35 years, last week we saw the first report discussing a regeneration of the ozone layer.\nRegarding political narrow-mindedness, we saw examples of that in the past. I will cite one. United States President Reagan\u2019s Secretary of the Interior, Donald Hodel, said that one way to protect against the thinning ozone layer was to purchase wide-brim hats and wear dark sunglasses. Why must we wait for the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide to result in a situation as serious as that involving the ozone layer? Why can we not, late next year, make Paris as successful as Montreal?\nI believe that the problem is larger than we imagine. Scientists already agree that the desired and often articulated objective of limiting the temperature increase to 2\u00b0C has become increasingly elusive. Only a few days ago, we read that the carbon dioxide concentration has never been higher than it was last year. We may well have reached the point at which, whether or not we come to an agreement today or tomorrow, scientists will tell us that all the consequences of irresponsible decisions past and present would still be felt in the future in the form of floods, typhoons and other adverse climate events.\nWe have to come to terms with the idea \u2014 and I would say that it will be very difficult \u2014 that the coming generation, our children\u2019s generation, will\ufffcunfortunately have to live with that situation. We will have to pay a dear price for our irresponsible environmental policies.\nToday it is no longer enough to reduce emissions. It is no longer enough to agree to reduce emissions. We have to prepare for more and more serious natural events and disasters. We have to heed the advice of Nicholas Stern, who said eight years ago that if we did not spend 1 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) on prevention, then the environmental damage we would suffer could amount to as much as 20 per cent of GDP.\nI have just cited the example of New York City. A few hundred million dollars would have been enough to\nmitigate damages totaling several billion. The New York example tells us that we are not in the twenty-fourth hour, but in the twenty-fifth. The tragedy endured by this metropolis, the host of our meeting, again justifies the words of Vegetius, somewhat amended to the situation \u2014 if you seek calm, prepare for disaster."
